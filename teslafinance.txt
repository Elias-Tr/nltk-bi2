Lmao Elon Musk going to sell more Tesla to buy a mining company?????
Tesla 400 puts lookin sexy
U forgot just buy a Tesla if you can‚Äôt afford gas
I can't even afford 1 Tesla call ngl
Tesla really down -4.20% on 4/20That memester musk is playing us
For all of you idiots comparing NFLX to TSLA - stop. It‚Äôs not close to the same. They literally just launched 2 giga factories that can outproduce the entire EV industry combined. The negative sentiment on NFLX was a lack of growth. Tesla is the EXACT opposite
Tomorrow half of you will be up bigley from tesla and half will be down bigley
Tesla, as priced, is 100% speculative. Amazon throughout most of its history was speculative as well. Obviously speculators were correct in that case--but that doesn't mean it was not speculative.The difference between speculation and investment is not that one is guaranteed to go up while the other will go down, or that "investment" only applies to good companies and "speculation" to bad ones. A company like Amazon may well be an incredible company-- and it is!-- but at some prices purchasing its shares becomes speculation because you are buying not based on performance but based on speculation about future performance.Saying that "Amazon at today's prices is a speculative purchase" is not the same thing as saying "Amazon is a bad company" or "Amazon is in a bubble and is going to go down".
And in your opinion is Tesla or Amazon an investment or speculation?
Love my Tesla
Not to mention how much oil derived products are in electric cars from basic lubricants in hinges to paint to all the plastic interior pieces and upholstery. As to that the other raw inputs that require oil and energy to produce from creation and transport to machining.  Maybe that's why Elon tweeted we need more oil. He's foreseeingg his costs rise exponentially and the cheapest Tesla rising in cost to unaffordable levels.
&gtDamn, this 5$ gas is expensive &gtBetter buy a 75k Tesla right away
I mean for ZIM probably, the other two is most likely go puts‚Ä¶ but playing IV means I‚Äôd sell before the report.  Whether the stock goes up or down won‚Äôt matter much if the volatility is good enough for premiums to hold value.So Monday buy ZIM, sell Tuesday before close, Wednesday buy the other and sell Thursday before close. Friday scalp Tesla maybe (and lose it all)
FYI Tesla solar roofs (even as a conventional panel installation)are complete garbage and the joke of the industry. Their batteries are decent behind-the-meter systems though. Source: buyside investor in sustainable infrastructure.
Its really just politics. Biden ignores Tesla because they're not unionized. Ford and GM are and Biden is pro-Union. As I said, all politics
Shoulda bought shares ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) i made 30 k on tesla stock
I hated every second of it. That said I have lost thousands on Tesla call and puts. Every time I buy a call it dips, and every time I buy a put it moons. It's actually incredible how I have managed to fuck myself every time
I mean Christ, Biden can't even acknowledge Tesla. Let alone Elon. I'm not a fan boy by any means, but that said, how can the administration ignore:Starlink, access to internet for all areas with satellite access, especially rural areas that struggle to get the lines in to or one itSolar roofs, this one needs no explanation. You want green energy, here you goSpaceX, Putin tells us to ride broomsticks to the moon.....or we could just continue to use SapceXEVs, Tesla is light years ahead of the world here as we all know.I feel like the infrastructure deal could just invest in Elon and get what they want.Guess I am a fan after all ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Everyone gets a flamethrower and a tesla? Im in
Maybe one day. I‚Äôll write an email to Biden and say that If he covers half my Wendy‚Äôs BJs I‚Äôll be able to buy a Tesla in 7 years
I‚Äôm too broke for a Tesla and these gas prices ain‚Äôt changing that.
Pelosi's tesla is holding up better than amazon, go figure.
To add a bit of a summary of DRSing, I have added this comment that kind of summarizes DRS and why I feel its our best bet to change the game for retail to be a truly fair and free market.I am borrowing a lot from u/criand's post on computershare so please check his account to know more and note his specific information on why direct registering of your shares might be the best way to punish those who turned off the buy button originally.Fast points is:WHY THE PREMISES OF DRS?\-First off Computershare is GameStop's transfer agent. Their entire point is to handle book keeping of GME shares. Computershare is also the transfer agent for Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Amazon, Overstock etc. AKA this aint their first rodeo.\-There is \~76.49 million shares of GME total. Of these insiders and institutions own roughly half. This leave the free float at between an estimated 35-40 million shares.-As of Oct Gamestop has confirmed that over 5.2 million of those shares were registered with Computershare.\-Now what happens if we register the entire float? Potentially this shows that every share not DRS'd is essentially a phantom share or was made by naked shorting. This could potentially end up with every share being withdrawn the DTC, who allowed these phantom shares to exist in the first place. I use potentially here because this has never been done before.\-What would happen next? Well that would put the choice into Gamestop's hands...they could withdraw Gamestop and make it private...which would mean every phantom share not registered would need to be closed, essentially a share recall.&amp#x200BHow is DRSing different from owning shares with your broker?Well when you DRS a share, your shares are registered in your name. How is this different from owning shares with a broker? Well technically when your shares are with a broker they are registered to you in your street name but the brokerages are the ones who have them. This means that the DTC does not view you as their customer, but the brokerages themselves. You have no protection under them.If a share is registered (DRS'd) in your name, you are protected and have insurance by owning the share directly. If you do not own the share and instead its in your "street name" you are at the mercy of your brokerage...but im sure your brokerage would never screw you by say...turning off the buy button or any other illegal practice right.The fact is your brokerages could be lending out your shares right now. Thats right the shares you own in a company you may believe in, could be lent out to be shorted against the very value play you are waiting to go off. Remember Cassandra requesting his shares back in 2020 taking months to get back to him...Lastly we are now on Day 18 of 100% Utilization. According to this there should be no more shares to short the stock...and yet they keep finding shares to short the stock. So do you think they keep finding loose shares in the couch cushions...or are they continuing to naked short shares?This has all been placed in the context of gamestop but the fact is this could be and probably is happening all over the market. Something sure as hell doesnt smell right. Overall this is just a short preview, again I really encourage you to check out u/Criand on DRSing as he explains it much better than I can.
So one of the things I want to really make clear is the position on DRS or direct registering your shares.  I am borrowing a lot from u/criand's post on computershare so please check his account to know more and note his specific information on why direct registering of your shares might be the best way to punish those who turned off the buy button originally.Fast points is: **WHY THE PREMISES OF DRS?**\-First off Computershare is GameStop's transfer agent.

Bring on the electrics, Tesla calls perhaps
imagine thinking everyday americans have the money lying around for a new Tesla
Calls on Tesla. Again.
As with everything in life: You know the graph will go up, but will it go up within your lifetime? And if not, did you teach your kids and grandkids to diamond hand a failing microsoft, amazon or tesla?
I'm fairly certain Tesla uses their own UI to render the map even if they might use Google Maps to serve the underlying map data. I forget what the terms of the SDK use vs API use are but I thought they both required some kind of license cost.Edit: looking at pictures from a "Tesla map view" Google search, there's a Google logo on the bottom right
What I suspect will really kick it forward is when some city works with a company to augment a road system with the markers, RFID  and other transmitted and sensors to allow the hardware in the car to be essentially absolutely reliable.I am talking about colored sticks on corners and lanes that are properly lPainted.I live in a province that does not paint the roads and uses an environmentally friendly paint that does not last. My 2021 Honda with lane assistance has that thing turning off and on like a Christmas light.I work with computer vision while minimal convinced me we were (and are) so many years away from cars that can "see" the road and not drive into a fucking semi like that Tesla did.It's worse in a place like this where were have snow, ice and lines that are essentially non existent. BUT..it could be much easier for the computer to drive that route if the car was engineered to have the data it needed by the infrastructure.
Nice. Remove it after they tank 80% And include Tesla into SPY after a 2000% runup. #IndexInvesting
Germans before Ukraine were like "Fuck Tesla". After Ukraine "Welcome Tesla, Save our Gas Prices".
How are they going to raise capital to buy all of these vehicles? Rent from their customers? Partnership with tesla?
Lmaoo Tesla $200 puts? Sorry after that can‚Äôt look at anything else you say
That‚Äôs cool calls on Tesla then cuz everybody gonn be like a Tesla is cheaper than a full tank of gas lmao
Tesla would benefit but their production capacity is already maxed out.
Your mom's Tesla is tho
Not to mention there are rumors that most of Europe will be pushing to move to get off fossil fuels in the next 10 years instead of the next 30 years because of this.Tesla cars and battery packs could be very in demand in Europe.
nothing more disappointing than waking up and tesla not being below 800.
My whole profile is geared toward a market crash at this point, so I hope you are right. Not lambo money, but I could get a Tesla if you're right.
So BoA gives Sofi a downgrade on the back of solid earnings? I may be a little slow but isn‚Äôt this like Ford giving Tesla or Microsoft giving Apple a downgrade? Seems shady as fuck. Sofi to the mooooon.
That's my favourite part about Tesla. Screw those crooked dealers. They completely destroy the customer experience. Direct to consumer is the way. Or at the very least, stop making prices be variable.
&gt	suck up naive investors who think that it‚Äôs an easy way to get rich quick.Everyone said the same thing about Tesla Bros and the stock went from $100 to $5000 equivilent post split.&gt	I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with these fools if they stuck to their own subs but they go out and try to convert other people.It started in WallStreetBets
Tesla is pinned strictly between 700-1200. To ez yall
fucking was up $600 today now down 4k on tesla puts lmaooo
With the amount of projects, people, and equipment cut in 20 and 21, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we passed that mark in 23.   Projects take a really long time to spin back up.    Only reason it dropped then was the whole deck of cards collapsed.  If it didn't the price would've easily gone past $200 back then.  I think the only difference between then is now is that would be the final push so many people would need to start the movement towards renewables.   Imagine the line of people ordering electric cars if gas spikes to $7-8 and filling up a 16 gallon tank on a normal car is $100+ and a 30 gallon SUV tank is $200+.   There weren't that many options in 08  now f150 lightning, cyber truck, Silverado, Tesla's emustangs Cadillac's.    How many people are going to call Tesla or a solar company first time they get a 2k power bill for AC cooling.  Those are structural changes in demand that's going to live for a while.
Let the Rivian price hikes be a lesson to you all. Tesla could not, and no other company can, make their first generation of EVs affordable while maintaing profit. Car companies go bankrupt because of the insane amount of capital and innovation it takes to reach positive free cash flow, and even then, it took Tesla 10 years. Rivian, Lucid, Ford, GM and any EV seller not named "Tesla" will continue to price gouge to maintain some kind of positive gross margin (and they will not succeed in the long run). Now you see the magnitude of what Tesla has accomplished, and how incredibly difficult it was for them to change the entire automotive industry and the world.Sincerely, a Tesla bull
In terms of a settlement figure, they‚Äôll get comps for similar cars within x radius with condition factored in. It‚Äôs not what you can realistically sell it for. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs available. Someone with a relatively new Tesla Yolk.  Paid $137k for it. Totaled in an accident. Not his fault. Insurance paid him $165k because of availability.  Obviously this isn‚Äôt always the case.
It's probably very very wise to start investing in electric vehicles. As a matter of fact, I'm probably about to buy one... And yes it'll be a Tesla
because of the UAW. tesla doesn't have unions.
**Russia screwed up the most!**    The current value of Sberbank shares is another evidence that fear and greed rule the market :)) Sberbank's assets have not gone away. $0.01 at Sberbank is from the same story as Tesla at $1200. These prices have nothing to do with the market.
üò¥ Joe failed to mention Tesla again tonight, despite mentioning every other electric car maker out there. ü§°
Biden sucking Ford and GM‚Äôs dicks on their late-to-the-game EV initiatives but doesn‚Äôt even give Tesla so much the courtesy of a reach around. Union Lobbying at its finest
Biden: gas is high buy a Tesla. Russia? Never heard of her but these sanctions are a bundle 2 for 1. Inflation? Jpow got that tomorrow ask him. By the way we got jobs all over the place check these numbers. Alright great time guys see you for the mid terms, calls on ice cream üòé
Tesla is 100% autistic
Biden needs to give all americans a tesla and bring in female ukrainian refugees.
my god tesla is so fucking retarded
I just want to take a moment and laugh at all the lucid fan boys who flooded this place when it was $40+ about how its the new tesla![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
I only need Tesla to go up another 14% by June and these puts that I sold will become completely worthless and I will have a stack of cash and everyone will love me again and all the girls I ever loved will call me back
Tesla announces shipping of over 40,000 "Not A Flamethrower's" to Ukraine forces for what Musk described to Zelensky as "Getting u sum crispy boys"
BREAKING: TESLA SOARS AFTER RUMORS IT‚ÄôLL SUPPLY UKRAINE WITH ELECTRIC TANKS
Nothing is going to change for Tesla EV business, Tesla is already selling every EV they can make, and will sell every EV they can make for many years, the same as anyone making EVs. Same with energy storage, I'm sure the demand is already huge but battery supply restricts how much they can sell.Solar roofs I think benefits, no one talks about Tesla solar roofs, so I don't know what limits solar roof growth.Increased demand can result in higher prices and profit margins. But either way, Tesla fast growing revenue/profits is already set to explode over the next few years as Tesla delivers 1.8 million EVs in 2022 and around 3 million in 2023.
I‚Äôm holding spy puts and a Tesla 750p for Friday. God help me
But tesla already has more orders than production capacity.
No SpaceX to the moon.. Tesla to the parking lot of the launch pad.
Ford&gtTesla
Elon Musk is in Iron Man 2. I wonder if there is an MCU Tesla
Stark industries has produced the same volume of Cybertrucks, roadsters and semis as Tesla despite being fictional.
SpaceX and Starlink are not part of Tesla as far as I know
Puts on companies like tesla and chargepoint.We dont need to prevent global warming when a nuclear winter is upon us.
&gt I couldn't tell if it was a 3 or an S, whats the indication for the difference.The S is the only Tesla that doesn't look like shit, it's easy to tell apart from the rest.
Who the fuck cashes out and buys a Tesla? This is WallStreetBets your supposed to keep rolling your gains over and over into the biggest bags ever assembled just for the honors of posting the biggest loss porn when it finally does go bust. That‚Äôs the real WSB god right there.
I worked on those ventilators from Tesla, they were indeed delivered
My Tesla stock is worth Lessla this year
Yeah but its a Tesla so he feels like its a Lambo
Not SpaceX I didn't think, that was founded from scratch if I recall correctly. Tesla was bought, but it was before any cars whatsoever were released so 99.9999% growth of the company was while under his control
Tesla does make a flamethrower‚Ä¶
He founded SpaceX. Not Tesla though
He also made them everything they are today. Your point is irrelevant, he didn't *say* Elon Musk founded those companies, just that he had good ideas. The original owners of Tesla wanted to make a handful of high-end sports cars, not create an entire EV industry.
Elon jumps on most newsworthy events and offers help that never materializes or simply doesn‚Äôt work, like the mini sub for the Thai Soccer team. He loves the PR and looking like the savior.  Also‚Ä¶.On 24 March, Musk promised to ship more than 1,000 procured ventilators to COVID-19 distressed hospitals around the country before producing more at his Tesla factory ‚Äì a promise that put his name and Tesla in the headlines of every newspaper and television news station in the country and throughout the world a level of publicity that it is impossible to put a dollar value on. But Musk never delivered. Instead, he sent bi-level positive airway pressure machines, which are used to treat apnoea, and do little for those with severe COVID-19 symptoms, unless they are converted into advanced machines.
It is, but those companies aren't under control by Elon.Electric cars and rockets were technology that existed before Tesla and SpaceX, but they weren't being used in the ways he wants.
This is why I bag hold Tesla‚Ä¶ well this and the insane profits. Still cheap at under 900 boys.
 Honestly Elon is hit and miss, he has great ideas, starlink and tesla for example, but then he comes up with shit like the boring company, which is just trying to solve traffic by adding more lanes... but underground. But I hate when people hate everything he does, you can dislike the guy without trying to discredit every single thing he does
Tesla tanks and planes en-route.
Elon Musk nows a good time to give Ukraine that Prism Tower or Tesla Coil you've been working on.
Weaponized Tesla bots en route
My tesla calls doubled Friday but forgot and didn't sell, looks like Monday will be a good day
Calls on Tesla
Haha. Hows your white tesla with black vanity plate?
Tried to order a Tesla last night then realized I‚Äôm broke.
Nah, just hopped outta my E63, the hate for tesla is more about the fact that they're a DEPLORABLE corporate entity that spends MILLIONS of dollars to make it so consumers cant repair their own cars, and fighting against right to repair of anything means fighting the right to repair everything. Fuck elon. Fuck tesla. Fuck anyone that doesn't support right to repair.   Also, its no longer 1999 maybe find a better insult than "h0m0s" you inbred rat fuck.
"A white Tesla with black CA vanity plates, please" - Every douche in SoCal
Imagine if Elon goes to jail for insider trading. The Tesla cult would be in shambles.
&gt Everyone who shorted Tesla in WW2 went brokeü§î How old was Elon during WW2?
It has historically. Pre war is uncertain. Once war begins markets go up. It did in WWI and it did in WW2. very high returns. Everyone who shorted Tesla in WW2 went broke
So you'd rather encourage an actual invasion where thousands if not more are going to die?    Fertilizer is actually already double what it was last year.  So that's a moot point.  North American wheat is mostly grown in Canada/US.    Gas, well that one would be f-d no matter what.  Only wish GM and Tesla fast tracked their electric trucks. :)
cheaper than a house, live in a Tesla
TESLA DEAD, so im [DEAD](https://www.factionfinancial.com/prediction/7d9a4885-00fe-4f72-b5a2-aaa56c23094c)
It'll speed up the process similar to Tesla. Elon basically got paid years before actually producing anything and that was what made his balance sheet so good. Even if it was a little shady, that cleverness couldn't be beaten by rational bear thesis.
yea tesla and gme are very similar
I held Tesla 3 years... It wasn't nearly this fun.
Tesla at 1200 end of day too much of an ask?

You lost me at "I consider myself a value investor and tesla"
Reminder that even at $400 Tesla is still ridiculously overpriced, in great economic conditions.
Tesla trades below 700 level in premarket trading
Tesla at 710$ in Europe. Uhhh Tesla price starting with a 6 soon?
Lol, you don't think Tesla is part of that revolving door either?https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/tesla-hires-former-sec-trial-lawyer-david-misler-as-managing-counsel.html
dude, he's only 5 years latehe always deliversi had a dreamand Tesla had PERRECT Level 4 self drivingit was 2337
Why did I buy Tesla FDs lol
Tesla going to 300 is far likelier than a volcano erupting under my bathroom. TSLA at $300 a share with unchanged earnings and book value would still be trading at 61 times earnings and 10 times book value.
Tesla bulls are losing it
Against Tesla? Fool
Yeah but it's a mighty fine coincidence how the market exists to help these billionaires though? Tesla dropped that stupid Hertz news about them buying 100k Tesla's for their fleet or whatever and off the back of that barely important news Wallstreet let up the shorting and let the stock run up to $1200 just in time for Elon's scheduled sales, the stock stayed there or there abouts for two weeks while he sold off in chunks, then WS started selling and shorting to bring it back down when he was done.Whole fucking game is rigged.
If Tesla falls to 250 within the next 2 years it means the market and economy are in such deep poop it barely matters how much you made on a put option. You're probably gonna be sharpening some sticks and getting ready to go out hunting humans for sustenance.
Why would I sell tesla when Tesla is at 750? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to buy TSLA at 750 and wait to sell it at 900? Or better yet 1200?
Anyone else retarded enough to yolo 20k in Tesla calls? I know I am
Tesla kind of feels like Enron rn
Buying‚Äô them dipping Tesla but it keeps on dippin‚Äô
Buying Tesla is Elon‚Äôs greatest accomplishment. I wonder if he wonders sometimes where he‚Äôd be today if he didn‚Äôt enter the board back in 2003, before becoming CEO.
You are comparing two different things and Apple has way higher profit margins per phone than a car. And Apple gets a ton of revenue from subscription (Apple Music) and its software platform (App Store).   Tesla is a car company. Car company multiples are P/E of 10-12. Tesla would have to sell more cars than the entire existing car market to justify its valuation currently. Where is the upside in that?
Damn, people are hate-selling Tesla for real
And now I hold Tesla bags.  This is fine, I‚Äôm actually picking up more long positions at this price.

I think he is, the SEC has been targeting him for years, and his lawyers have established that the SEC is failing to follow their own rules and procedures when dealing with Tesla so they now have grounds to go after the SEC. It's gonna be an interesting show to watch! Grab some popcorn.

While I agree with most of this I think sometimes people forget Tesla isn‚Äôt a car company. They‚Äôre a battery company. They‚Äôre slowly moving into commercial power storage and generation. This is the classic vertical integration strategy. Eventually Tesla will dominate the entire electrical grid. Amazon did the same thing by ‚Äúselling books‚Äù. In 10-15 years we‚Äôll look back and it will be so obvious. Tesla will be the Amazon of electricity storage and generation.
Sorry bulls if you want the bull market back you gotta sacrifice Tesla to the bears
Every retard who bought the 1000 Tesla run is now dead
I thought I was retarded Then I saw 3K volume on the weekly Tesla 1000c
tesla offering more shares LMFAOüòÇüòÇ
Tesla is going to get cut in half and is overvalued as fuck. I love the idea of what Tesla does but competition is showing up to the market place and let‚Äôs be honest when we say Tesla is largely dependent of one man. Elon.
Facebook, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Netflix is a fun one I like to think of.
IV on them has absolutely tanked. He'd be picking up pennies in front of a Tesla Cybertruck.
All that research just to yolo tesla calls?
Also, when you get out of your time machine, invest in Tesla.
You had me at Tesla 2000
If you buy tesla ITM calls rn youre chilling
This is a great read OP, but may want to share it somewhere else. Half the retards here don‚Äôt even truly know what a stock or bond is besides tesla and memestocks.
Tesla is going to be at 200 in a week after they lose the ability to do business in China due to sanctions going both ways
Tesla puts are going to yield the largest return IMO. Lots of room to fall compared to indexes
-apple was to late to the phone business any one heard of nokia lately?-NFT might be far fetched but so was electric cars when TESLA entered the market, everyone is following now.-you don‚Äôt understand shorting either.-they can burn as much cash as they want as long as it‚Äôs invested in future profits, they have 1.3B cash do the math.-internal rate return is low because they had invested 0 in moving forward, you want a bet internal return rate will jump as soon as their play is in place?
how is $GME with a (share price/book value) of 4.4 over valued ? so you are telling me you are wasting your sweat shouting that a 4.4 is overvalued.Apple 41-Amazon 12-tesla 35-microsoft 15-$GME positive outlook:/emerging e-commerce player/NFT player, possible leader/100% short availability utilization/55 million pro member users./A+ new management team/Ryan Cohen your play!!!
Sigh. Go to way back machine. Look at 2016. Look at biotech wsb era or Janet Yellen/leveraged gold wsb era. There ABSOLUTELY was a time when there was good info. Tesla corona and gme are all comparatively recent plays. Wsb is a ~decade old.Get off my lawn.
Apparently there are state laws around this, which is why Tesla has to put their new lot on a Native American reservation in New Mexico.
You kind of lost me respect here.Tesla might be fine long term but the reality is it‚Äôs future profits will never make up for the crazy ass valuation people are paying for it now
that‚Äôs because the quality of the posts in this sub have gone down tenfold. We pushed AMD at nine dollars. even fucking micron at $40 was the biggest stock in this sub four years ago.edit: oh and Tesla. I‚Äôve seen Tesla here for years. Before the split. at 400 pre split was already late to the partywe used to get blessed by people making seven figures who just decided to share some wisdom, now you got a bunch of retail idiots who think their DD is worth it‚Äôs weight in shit
Had to sell the Tesla and get back to work after the last call right?
Tesla puts look pretty good... if the premium wasnt in the fucking thousands
He's prolly trying to get back all the Tesla put money he disappeared
Cars are a status symbol when it comes to which brands people buy. There's a reason a lot of wealthy people only buy luxury car brands and wouldn't consider a cheaper car from a non-luxury brand that may objectively be better in a lot of ways then their expensive luxury vehicle.Tesla's brand is kind of like Apple. Either you love it and are obsessed with the company, or you deeply hate it and hate the "cult-like" brand loyalty it has with a lot of other people.Also, sometimes reputations of certain automakers will make people refuse to buy anything from them. For example I don't care what strides GM makes in the future, I'm not buying from them because of what they did with the EV1, and I'll never trust their EV's because of the Bolt battery recall and GM's mismanagement of the situation. There's people who think Tesla's cars have too many quality control issues to consider buying them.So yeah, while I don't agree with the OP, I can understand why he/she might feel that way about Tesla.
It‚Äôs the entire reason I minimized my position in them to 1% of my portfolio 3 years ago. I feel they have already tapped out most of the luxury market and I don‚Äôt see the growth potential everyone else does. People are way underestimating the capabilities of other automakers who have been titans of industry for the last 100 years. And don‚Äôt give me the but Tesla has factories bs. I‚Äôm long 20 years so I don‚Äôt care about the next 10z
[Model 3 is slated to be the top selling EV in Europe this year](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-dealership%2C-sales-and-marketing/tesla-model-3-track-be-europe%E2%80%99s-top-selling-ev)
She was Extremely lucky with Tesla lmao, balance it out I guess
Agreed. I have a 2016 90d that‚Äôs my second Tesla, and I bought it from Tesla a year ago. The delivery experience was really bad - they lost my car for several weeks, and I had it all of two days before I had to take it back in.I think if they keep that up people will look elsewhere, no matter how good the tech is.
She's still cool in my book every one on reddit in general should know you can't point fingers when money is lost its not the right thing to do just wait if tesla sinks every papa musk lover will be hating on him crazy world man
It seems like the supercharger network is not thought of enough in these discussions. Until I owned a Tesla I didn't consider it but it is a huge advantage. I could not imagine owning an EV without the ability to quickly charge in many areas. This will be the greatest advantage in the short term in my opinion.
Why would you never buy a Tesla? You wouldnt buy it even if it is better? Hypothetically?
All Cathie got right beyond Tesla was piling into low volume, money burning shit companies
To me it really only matters what the money is spent on if you're not covering everything you need. If you're putting off going to the doctor to afford a Tesla and not barely saving anything you're not really within your means. Same is true if someone, like a parent, is subsidizing everything (e.g, saving 20 of the 30K you make while your parents cover NYC rent isn't living within your means either).
I recently went to NYC to buy something off FB marketplace, was going to be in and out. I drive a Tesla and figured I‚Äôd charge just enough at the last stop before arriving and I‚Äôd just charge in the city to get home. All the superchargers are in parking garages you have to pay minimum of $30/ half hour to park in. Oh and then there‚Äôs some 18% parking tax? Yeah. Best part? They won‚Äôt let you be inside your car while you‚Äôre charging, so my partner and I were just freezing outside for 20 minutes while we waited and watched our car to make sure they weren‚Äôt gonna rummage through it. He even said he‚Äôd call the cops if I didn‚Äôt use the supercharger since I didn‚Äôt see the sign that said ‚Äústop, wait for attendant‚Äù posted in an obscure location at the entrance. What usually costs me $7 to get ~150 miles of charge cost me $43 for ~120 miles of range because I didn‚Äôt want to risk them charging me an additional $15 for the $45/hr rate. Ludicrous.
I‚Äôve driven all kinds of EVs.. only one came close to being better than the Tesla model Y and it was the Audi Etron SUV. i really love the comfort of the Audi etron but their range, cargo space,  and tech was their shortfall. I liked it but i loved the tesla tech more even with the quality issues (which i didnt really notice anything while i had one for a month).What really wins for me was the entertainment, pet mode, and sentury mode.If the audi had those, i would have gone audi even with the shorter range and smaller cargo hold.I really loved the haptic feed back from the etron on the screen for climate control. I also loved the toll pass system built into the car. I live in the bay area and it was nice not having to stick a toll pass on the windshield.
Then there's the implication of the current valuation, even after falling close to 50%: Tesla will supply all the cars in the world, then all the other vehicles in the world, then they will invent a robot that does all jobs in the world better than humans.
Tesla owner here - Tesla‚Äôs service is currently their Achilles heal. It‚Äôs really a mess, and I think that combined with persistent quality issues will affect their ability to scale if they don‚Äôt address it (given the lack of 3rd party repair shops also).I have a backlog of 3 recalls, but I‚Äôm not addressing them until something else breaks.
Tesla keeps on building cars with no quality control and that will eventually catch up to them and hurt reputation. People still think Kia‚Äôs and Hyundais are junk even tho that hasn‚Äôt been the case for 10 plus years. Telsa service is already very strained with the current work load. They need to really expand service or again they will continue to Tarnish their reputation. Telsa also needs more models and updated models to stay competitive. People are only going to buy the same looking model 3 and y for so long. 3 is already 5yrs old and the y looks pretty much identical to that. 3 is a good looking car but is starting to get dated. Model S is in the same boot. Very dated at this point and quality is very poor. Tesla at its current evaluation is a very poor investment imo. Disclaimer - I own a model 3
I have been an ev user from 2012 and also worked in the industry. Recently switched to Tesla. Few observations from experience/perspective.When I was in ev industry, in 2015 , companies like Ford and GM were actively anti-ev. They only did token vehicles due to govt pressure. Even now, the execs in these mammoths are not really committed. They are forced to do it. This half ass attempt reminds me of BarnesAndNobles vs Amazon struggles. The gm/fords are too slow and will always prefer ice atleast for next decade. They are too much tied up in their own-shit to do a clean break.The traditional car companies will always be held back by dealerships. Hundreds of anticompetitive local laws favors dealers and this boondoggle will drown or make it very slow to change. Tesla is the only company which offers direct sales and boy, I loved the experience. Consumer, once they get the taste of it, will hate the dinosaur brands even more.Teslas investment in supercharger is unparalleled- it is almost like Amazon prime. Other companies still havent seriously thought about fast charging, and relies on shitty infra from companies like Electrify America- further burning their brand.My point is, they dont have any serious competition for next 3 to 5 years. A 45k model 3 is better than a 65k audi etron. Fords mustang or polestar etc do not even comeClose in value, unless they sell it for half of todays price.That said, I do feel Tesla may be overvalued, from a number‚Äôs perspective. Even if they sweep competition at an Amazon scale, still they may not worth the current market cap. Competition is not gonna catchup with Tesla yet.
Are you asking about Tesla the company or TSLA the stock?The movement of the latter has not always correlated with the fortunes of the former.
Surprised tesla hasn't designed her a vibrating neuralink strapon with autocum mode
Let's listen to the guy who said Bear sterns will not go bust, and tesla will go nowhere.
As someone who already thinks Tesla is already ludicrously and stupidly overvalued, may God have mercy on your soul
Alex Karp shit the bed. He had an army of loyal investors just like elon musk and Tesla. That is more than enough for any ceo to take time to build an amazing company.Instead of doing that, he awarded himself 100% of revenue as a bonus and dumped that steaming pile of dilution all over retail. The only thing he could do now is show that he actually likes the company...that he thinks it‚Äôs a good deal at the current price. That means he can take $200,000,000 of the $500,000,000 he made and buy the dip on his own company rather than wait to be issued shares for free.He has all the voting power, of course he will just give himself infinity shares. This is why no one trusts the executive team. They are a clown car of retarded monkeys when it comes to shareholder value. If Karp bought the dip at these prices it would show current investors that there is a floor to the price and at the very least that he would share the pain along with his shareholders. This is exactly the strategy elon musk used with Tesla. He didn‚Äôt just dump shares the moment he got them. He took out loans against his options and held those shares for years.Yes, it sucked to see Tesla dip on hood news, but it made holding easier knowing that elon lost more of his wealth as a percent than I did every time Tesla took a dip.Just be real: Karp doesn‚Äôt need $500,000,000 cash on top of his cash salary of $3,000,000 on top of his insane share compensation. He is just a greedy ü§°. Other than an extraordinary move like the one I outlined above, there is nothing that will really restore investor confidence. As things stand, Karp said he would not stop diluting at a rate of 10% a year...that means his 35% growth ends up being 25% growth for shareholders. I totally believe he will invent another reason to award himself 100% of revenue as well. Game plan: wait until PLTR hits $2/share. At this point Karp will have to stop the dilution or risk getting delisted. Once they make a u-turn, there might be an investment here.
This guys sounds like a Tesla investor

Why? Because this market has been in super bubble land for 2 years. There is absolutely no technical or analytic reason for 90% of the companies in the SPY to have the valuation they do. When the market reaches a point where it swings down 5% because the wind blows to the left then you know you've reached peak greed. Everyone trying to squeeze that last 10% at the ATH's while simultaneously heading for the door everytime they see any news. Basically trying to time to the market for it's inevitable 20-30% correction. The market doesn't make any sense and that's how you know it's going to tip any day for any reason. Company A posts record gain and expects to grow another 20% by next quarter. Flat on earnings, trades down. Company B posts expectations and is going fairly good. flat lines. Company C posts negative earnings. Expects another 2 years before first profit. Sails to ATH. There are companies like Tesla doing fancy accounting to show some profits and their valuation is 188x forward looking. A normal PE ratio for a car company is like 14 tops. 14. Aka 13 fucking Teslas haha. TLDR: when the market hits the peak of greed it looks for any reason or sign to run for the exit. If not Russia, then the Fed, if not the fed, then CPI, if not CPI, then apple reporting your grandma didn't buy the new iPhone. Any negative news sends everyone to the door because literally EVERYONE is expecting a crash.
Tesla is still the most valuable car company. üìûü§≥‚òéÔ∏è we‚Äôre in a bubble
2/25 1000c on Tesla?You're already fucked &amp you don't even know it.
Are you really comparing Tesla to Roblox?
Their earnings are tomorrow and they'll probably beat expectations, so buy PUTS so you can watch your wallet cry üëçBut in all seriousness, I think it can help if you check out the chart and see if it gives you a good opportunity for a bounce tomorrow. Or, if you can day trade, go with the momentum first, then consider swinging. Check around 30 min after market opens and wait for a Hammer (bullish), Rejection of a good resistance level (bearish), or wedges. Remember to use QQQ for reference I mostly missed it today, but if you check QQQ around 10:01 AM (or 7:01 if you live in the west coast like me), QQQ began creating a falling wedge pattern. The hammer candle followed by the green candle at 10:27, and then the breakout of the wedge was super bullish. Most of my funds didn't clear, but I got a super cheap contract and still made around 120% profit.___Tomorrow, look for premarket levels, chart them on tradingview or webull, and just watch for what happens. The goal is to daytrade the momentum first, then if you want to take a chance, try swinging a contract or open up a straddle/strangleI want to swing a call, but... Well, I got burned on Tesla earnings pretty badly, so I'm not very confident in what the outcome will beSorry for the long explanation, but Godspeed üëç
Tesla train is just starting to accelerate, free seats are still available. Not too late to hop on
NIO because I missed the Tesla train beeeeeeeach and sand.
Lol so it's just Tesla but a charity...
TBH, I don't really care about the average American.I care about what SpaceX does and that Tesla made electric cars cool (again).
You can tax people at 90% and the public will still only see 10% or less of that.Every dime of extra money goes musk has goes back into space x and Tesla. He paid his gov. loan off early, with interest, because he didn't need to use it.. He could have held on to it for over a decade longer but since he's not a scumbag like most other wealthy people, he didnt.There's tax loopholes and most exploit them due to pure greed, yet everyone has their sights on one of the few people benefiting the u.s economy. Everyone on here would take advantage of every possible tax loophole if they could, then probably spend the money they saved on meme stock call options.If he was buying gold plated toilets and golfing all day I could see an issue with it. If he gave 200 billion to the government tomorrow, nothing would change other than an increase in our defense budget and raises/bonuses for politicians.If musk didn't make Tesla what it is, Ford and gm would be making bigger cars with bigger engines like they have been for the last century. It's so weird seeing everyone wanting to crucify game changing people like besos and musk, yet quiet about the Waltons and all the other greedy trust fund families.Dude obviously knows what he is doing, while the government obviously doesn't.
Found the guy who bought puts on tesla when it was worth $300 and got rekt
I have been holding Tesla since 2018. I think you'll need to find someone else to scoff at.
&gtBut the Tesla shares are at least worth something tangible, while those art donations are basic scams.lol, revisit this comment in a few years and we can talk about which is a scam and which isn't.
These are common schemes and should be closed.That said, Elon is probably following the Gates strategy to donate to a charity he controlls (gonna leave that typo) so that he can pursue his philanthropy tax free.It's still not fair compared to the middle class. But the Tesla shares are at least worth something tangible, while those art donations are basic scams.
Buy the lease out. Sell the Lexus when you take delivery of the Tesla.

Read your DD, bought tesla calls
&gtWe have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. See below Model S/X annual sales for years 2017 to 2021.  &gt  &gtIt is easy to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $90K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $90K and not 7-year old used one for the price of $35K.But you still draw the same terrible conclusion. You cite that 2021 sale and low and attribute it only to a lack of demand. And that's wrong.I'll tackle another one. Tesla's TAM isn't 'the EV market'. It's THE VEHICLE market. Period. Tesla competes with Honda and Toyota even when they don't really offer comparable BEVs. Tesla's market share?[https://ibb.co/Q86f9xt](https://ibb.co/Q86f9xt)Does that look like their share of the vehicle market is shrinking?

This is literally the most ignorant comment I have ever read in my entire time on WSB's.  You sir are a bona fide moron.You reach so far and so hard you might need to see a chiropracticor.  By your fucking dumb as a rock logic every company but farming and mining doesn't really make anything.  Tesla? Nope. Walmart? Nope.  Amazon? Double nope.I fear for you taking a shower, you most certainly will drown without the ability to oxygenated through your nose.  Your thesis relies on the state of the company 30-40 years ago (go look up when Toy Story was released), they didn't disappear then, and they have a war chest guaranteeing they won't now.This is such a dumb thesis I'm almost proud of you for just being able to form sentences.  Shine on you crazy, dumb, ignorant diamond.
Makes you wonder which global strategists are calling each other like, "Hey Putin its Brandon. Yeah I told everyone you were gonna nuke Ukraine so I could finally afford three shares of Tesla. Sorry for the drama".
$1200 Tesla bags Gona be HEAVY at 500 later this year ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Under usual market circumstances many cars depreciate more than 50% of their value over 5 years. So that brand new $30k car may sell for $12k, costing you $18k. Even if your assumption about it being worth $15k is correct, then second part about a 10 year old car being worth almost nothing isn't true. The 10 year old car may be worth $8k (varies a lot by make and model and condition by this age).In general, cars depreciate with exponential decay of price, so the amount they lose in value is less each year. That is, older cars are cheaper. This is true even with the cost of maintenance, up until a point where you have a major failure, and at that point the car usually gets scrapped.The twist with the market at the moment is that there are supply chain shortages, so all cars are expensive, but used cars have increased in price more than new ones. So used cars are slightly less better value than new ones than usual. However, because all cars are expensive now, you are probably better off waiting until supply chains are back to normal before buying, if you can.One other, non-financial thing to bear in mind is that cars get trashed on the road. It's pretty grim having a shiny new car that you spent a fortune on getting scratched up and dinged in the parking lot. A friend of mine bought a new Tesla, and within 3 weeks he'd hit a wild turkey, and scraped it on a kerb, and he was pretty gutted.
No.... referring to all the retard that just hate amc , don't know why everyone alway comparing amc to gme , why not compare gme to tesla or amazon or Berkshire heth or every other stock , why amc all the time why not Microsoft why not microvision why not clove .... why always amc , bunch of retards , calm down and slow your role
See the trick is to cycle between SPY and QQQ to avoid day trading too hard for max gains. Then proceed to blow up your account on a Tesla 0dte FD
I‚Äôm a self hating Tesla fan man. I‚Äôm just here to destroy oil man
Cohen founded Chewy.com and then sold it for billions. Elon bought his way into Tesla with daddy's money. Two very different types of entrepreneurs.
&gt It's like that with a lot of cars&gt just software the dealer updatedMost cars require you to go to dealers to update.  Teslas will update at everyone's home, at no real cost or extra load for Tesla/service centers.
It's a technicality that they have to call it a recall, almost every Tesla recall is just a software update, no one has to turn their car back to Tesla for. It's tantamount to government sanctioned market manipulation imo.
I love how the bull market depends on 5 fuckin stocks Whole world can go to shit and no one blinks so long as Apple Microsoft Amazon Tesla and a few others stay up..
Anti tesla works wonders in the new WSB lol. This is also the shittest recall of all time. Taking a fun feature away from the cars. You can still do the same shit by putting your windows down and playing music. Now you just put more stress on your climate control, thus using more energy, and thus harming the environment. This is actually an anti environment recall.
Note:Tesla recalls are almost always a software update pushed to the cars. LOL
Ok been waiting 15 years. Tesla is highly vertically integrated, while ford and GM just do final assembly. That‚Äôs why Tesla has doubled output during the ‚Äúchip shortage‚Äù while ford and GM shrink unit sales. How many decades for them to follow suit?
News article: "Tesla recalls 578,600 cars due to something being wrong"Public perception: Wow, they have to bring back in 578,600 cars to fix something wrong with the parts or something, thats really badReality: "Tesla recalls 578,600 cars, which really means they are going to send a software update over the internet, so the cars in fact do not have to be physically moved from one location to another, and so no it will not cost tesla tons of money to do so"
isnt it funny how much the media seems to hate tesla with all these bullshit article titles? imagine if apple had to send a software update to all iphones and there were articles saying "apple recalls 30 million iphones"
‚ÄúThe regulator said about 578,600 cars were potentially involved in the recall, which Tesla plans to solve by remotely updating its software rather than forcing owners to come to service centres.‚ÄùReally convenience for you to simply ignore this part? Hmmm
Damn, Tesla sucks I guess. I‚Äôll trade you guys my two Teslas for whatever you‚Äôre driving. Kidding, but you can buy them used for more than I paid for them when I upgrade to an X or CT in a couple years.
More attempts to distract from what really matters, like their insane margins, exponential growth in sales, and high JD Power scores. Looking at January registrations in US, (all sales, not just EVs) Tesla has 40k, which is 7th. Once Texas comes online they have potential to join top 5 auto brands in US, and their margin is at 31%, which is double the next highest automaker.
Tesla bears will tell you this is the end for the company. A recall where Tesla pays nothing, no impact to the consumer and free press showcasing their advanced tech. It‚Äôs the end of Tesla.
ya'll laughed at my tesla 895P  0dte.who's laughing now.![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Better chance than the Tesla one
Got out of my Uber calls a few minutes before it dumped, bought and day traded Tesla puts instead, and now I'm about to have a nice cold beer cause looks like everyone got fucked today.
First of all, no shit the Iv crushed you when you had 2 days until expiry and still 20% out of the money.Buy calls/puts in the money for 50-70% gains. Stop trying to get 50,000% like those Tesla retards did back in the day.
Tesla target price $500 after a 20 for 1 split (1 for 20? Idk I‚Äôm retarded)
What a dumb market bro, shittier than expected CPI today, stronger weekly labor numbers, all pointing to much more hawkish Fed coming up and possibly like stated a .50p increase, yet the market takes off again? LOL I swear this is beyond any logic, other than fucking algos and hedgefunds pumping so that we hold the bag when the whole shit hits the fan. Look at TESLA for example... on top of all, they had like 3 recalls in the last 2 weeks and shit, and it takes off again.... Twitter fucked its earnings, was dropped and it's already back at 38 in just 1 hour. What's interesting is that institutions, money makers, etc. are typically the ones trading post/pre market, and they dropped everything early this morning so here we go to buy it all thinking it is a bull run again LOL. They know  how we think by now, so they'll let us into it, and let it run and fuck us in the ass coming down next. This is dumbfuckery at its best.
Respectfully the tesla is coming before the tuition, but my calls aren‚Äôt nearly otm enough to expect my whole tuition out of a serious run
Tesla fanboys ‚ÄúMusk is the smartest man alive and I follow his every move‚Äù but somehow missed him selling the top.
pretty obvious that Tesla and Elon haters have an internal self hatred. There's literally no reason to be upset or have one's mental framework threatened by Elon's success. Haters care about him even more than I do, and I'm a fan of Tesla
I believe the CPI data released tomorrow is using 2019-2020 as a baseline, which may help artificially deflate the number a bit, lessening the blow.I predict it goes down, JPow fires up the printers, and Tesla sees $1200 again. Or milk is $27/gal and we're all fucked. Who knows. 0dte OTM SPY calls yolo imo.
Elon on Monday: "Tesla probably should be around $30 a share tbh"
Things. Lol. Tesla made me a millionaire already and then some.
This is like the 5th tesla one I‚Äôve been on. Rolled into these at the top after selling my 900-1100 strikes for a good profit
I'd argue that Tesla is not taking self driving seriously by shipping buggy implementation without using the best sensors or compute. Compare that to Waymo or Cruise's approach. There were no horse and buggy companies the size of modern car companies or as politically embedded. A more illustrative example are something like the Japanese Zaibatsu (or Korean Chaebols). Mitsubishi was a coal and shipping organization, Toyota starting making looms and textile manufacturing equipment. These organizations use their incredible momentum, both in terms of cash piles, and just raw political power.That doesn't mean I'm not bullish on Tesla but all these claims that they should be valued at near 100% of the future electric car market are ridiculous. The absolute best case scenario is something like Apple where they don't have a dominant market share overall but do have a dominate share in segments that still have margins (luxury cars). I see that argument, there is only one brand of car literally launched into space, you cannot beat Elon for brand value. But that is not nearly enough to make Detroit irrelevant.
What's funny is that the line used to "Tesla can't compete with ICE cars, worse range, long recharge etc." I guess ICE cars are no longer considered competition.&gtI cannot wait until the automakers who sell millions of cars release competitive vehicles, which is imminent.Define imminent. As per their own plans that is still years away for most if not all.
Based on the amount of likes on Musk's tweet I must conclude that Tesla is headed to 1 to 16400 split.
Man yall are still thinking this is just a car company. Without looking at everything tesla has under its umbrella. What other car manufacturer is anywhere near close to assisted self driving much less fully automated self driving. What other car manufacturer produces their own batteries and also the entire system to manage said batteries. What other car company is aligned with a private space company? What other car manufacturer has turned the entire auto world on its head(Ford in the early 1900's when they released cars for the people). The reason you can't see value is because you're only looking at one aspect that in the long run is gonna be a tiny piece of a musk conglomeration. But right now it's the only way to get a piece of the musk action. I'm a minor fan boy of his on he has innovated at multiple companies by coming up with a vision and then working with the right people on how to accomplish said mission. I do however dislike him due to some of his personal stances but ultimately I see the value in who he is as an innovative leader.
Thanks for a real answer beyond "china money bad" (as if Tesla, Activision, Spotify and Snapchat aren't also minority owned by Tencent). Actually you bring up a good point that most non profitable tech companies corrected around  30% in a span of a month - same thing also happened to $MELI. Seems that most DCF capm spreadsheets have applied a similar discount rate and concluded largely similar results (-30%). I guess I shouldn't be shocked, though the market hasn't been running on DCF for a long, long time.
Elon's cocksuckers are so ridiculous. I cannot wait until the automakers who sell millions of cars release competitive vehicles, which is imminent. Fuck Elon, fuck Tesla, I'm out
You do realize that 5% of Tesla is owned by tencent, among many others? This may shock you, but most American companies have at least a minority share owned by Chinese money. Don't be naive.
Tencent owns a minority stake of 20% of SE due to venture capital. Gosh,didn't realize this made SE a china companyBy your dumb retard logic, here are some of Tencent's other stakes in "American"  companies:Tesla - 5% stakeSnapchat - 14% stakeSpotify - 10% stake(Among several more)Those goddamn china companies like Snapchat and Tesla better gtfo out of America, man.
Tesla has revenue so it must be undervalued
TESLA right where they suppose to be.
damn I thought I was in bad shape with my 4 March 1100c tesla calls at - 18% currentlybut i see in not as retarded nowwe'll there's nothing else i would love more than for your calls to be worth a lot
This list is wildly underselling this week. Rivian, the bubbliest of bubbly IPOS in the bubbliest sector of the bubbliest market since Y2K has earnings the day after the first definitively hawkish FOMC meeting in two years. Could be the biggest swing trade(or trap) of the decade.   Personally I just buy F calls for the runup and GM puts at $64 (Look at that chart, GM running up to $64 is one of the most consistent put plays ever). Obviously you have to consider Tesla too but the options are pricier.
Tesla net profits were up 389% YoY last quarter. No shit it's gonna have a high PE. Let's say they hypothetically repeat this growth for 2 years, the PE ratio is now 26. Do it for a 3rd year and it's now 6.8I worry for this sub sometimes.
Option J. Las Vegas coke hookers let it ride on your favorite game you'll have more fun then letting these degenerates decide your fate or Tesla calls lol
Tesla has single most worrying bus factor of any big corporation. Imagine what happened to Tesla stock, if Musk was hit by bus tomorrow‚Ä¶
what matters is the amount of shares offered in relation to the current total outstanding shares. If tesla has 800K shares and issues 200K more, they went from having 4 slices of pie to 5 slices, all current shareholders lose 5% of their value.If amc has 300K shares and issues 200K more, they go from 3 slices to 5, each original slice dropping 13%, from 33% ownership to 20%.
Tesla did sell additional shares, no where near as dilutive as amc basically doubling its shares count tho. Tesla also took that cash to fund their massive factory productions, so the capital is actually being put to work in an accretive way, not simply paying off massive debt obligations like AMC
&gt  Everyone knows Tesla a isn't shit without ElonI wonder how much would tesla plunge if Elon really did quit/resign/retire whatever word he would use.....?? I bet it would be under $600 in a month. the minute he makes that announcement for real - that's when i get the balls to short tesla.
I own Tesla.  Think they will do great things, but they are sort of a league of 1 right now.  Tesla is probably not going to be the norm.
He‚Äôs only supposed to get permission for tweets about Tesla, he can tweet about cumming on peas all he wants lol.
Apple to this day is only selling half the phones in a year that Nokia did at their peak when they made 9 of the 10 best selling phones on the market. So are you saying that Apple is absurdly overvalued to because they've yet to make as many phones as Nokia, yet their market cap is significantly higher then Nokia's ever was?Volume isn't the only thing that matters. The margins and profits for each sale matter to. As do other business sectors that Apple &amp Tesla have when you make that kind of a comparison.
I think this is what the market and government policy want, but the problem is supply chain. Tesla spent a decade building up the market for batteries. The first GM/LG produced battery isn‚Äôt projected to be in a car until somewhere in the 2028-2030 timeframe.They can buy some batteries at huge costs to build limited quantities of EVs. 50k here and 10k there, but Tesla‚Äôs going to knock on the door of 2 million cars next year. Even if Rivian/GM/Honda design a superior product, the batteries literally aren‚Äôt there for them to produce in volume.It‚Äôs effectively a captive market for Tesla for the next 3-5 years, regardless of how many deals with Salesforce or appearances on Jim Cramer Farley has up his sleeve.
He's worth over $200bil with all his other shit outside of Tesla. Even if he wouldn't be a hostage target with that kind of money why wouldn't you have a security detail? He could have 1000 people following him and 1000 people leading him, paying them $100k each for 1,000 fucking years without interest. The guy is absolutely loaded.
A few months ago, my girlfriend got alcohol poisoning at a nightclub and had to be taken to the hospital. She was completely unconscious when the paramedics arrived and I was worried sick about her. My phone had died earlier in the night and I had no way of contacting her or calling an Uber to the hospital. At around 2am, I ran to a nearby gas station and used their landline to confirm which hospital she had been taken to. Out of shear desperation, I asked a man in the gas station parking lot if he could drive me to the hospital. Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing this but I had no phone or any way of paying for a taxi / Uber. He agreed and said it was on his way home. We spent 15 minutes in the car chatting and he dropped me off. I was extremely thankful and thought nothing of it. I gave him my number and told him if he ever needed something he could hit me up. About an hour later, I receive a number of texts from him. He was repeatedly asking whether he should buy Tesla or SPY puts. I was still at the hospital and blocked his number. What I originally thought was a kind stranger turned out to be a üåàüêª. I‚Äôm grateful that nothing happened that night and I made it out of his car safely. No matter how desperate you are, never take a ride from a stranger.
Good news: buy AppleBad news: sell everything else and buy AppleNo news: buy AppleThis pretty much summarizes the stock market for the past few weeks.If Elon sold Tesla to Apple a few years ago, Apple would likely be a $4T company now.My prediction: First company reaching $4T valuation: AppleFirst company reaching $5T valuation: AppleFirst company reaching $6T valuation: AppleFirst company reaching $7T valuation: AppleFirst company reaching $8T valuation: AppleFirst company reaching $9T valuation: AppleFirst company reaching $10T valuation: Apple
People (myself included) said Tesla was a huge bubble when they where worth around $100B, now they are worth $1.000B, who says they wont be worth $2.000B in a few years. If i have learned something from the last 2 years is that you never bet against bubbles.
I also bet that's exactly how it happened. Everyone knows Tesla a isn't shit without Elon
Ford couldn't figure out how to make EVs until Tesla became worth 20x them in 10 years.... they're not innovative in any way and are very slow to put out anything resembling a modern EV.They were sticking 6.2L supercharged V8s in Raptors while Rivian was making deals with Amazon.
Judge tried to order that but they got around it somehow. I'm 80% sure he's still pissed at SEC for the whole Twitter thing so he's shitposting knowing they're logging all of it and trying to determine whether it affects stock price. He might also be making an excuse for himself later. If he does tweet something about Tesla and the stock drops or rises and the SEC comes after him for stock manipulation again, he can just show all the old tweets and say his posts all have a joking quality to them
If you‚Äôre not in apple, Microsoft,Adobe or Tesla. Any big name shit, you‚Äôre basically getting raped today
Once a shitload of people lose money on AMC going bankrupt it probably will and GME will be a Tesla lite on here
He's probably getting banned from holding executive positions at public companies for the SolarCity fraud. He can't be CEO anymore so he's pretending he's resigning. And his brain broke and he knows Tesla will fail without him
The Tesla stock price is one big Manic-Depressive rollercoaster.Source: am a TSLA hodler.
He never goes home, I have a friend that used to work for Tesla and he‚Äôd see Elon asleep in the hallway surrounded by security detail every other day. The dude is nuts.
[A sea otter holding a scallop has a more stable net worth than tesla option holders these past two weeks.](https://youtu.be/Mho-BpcV9g8?t=4)
Hes shorting tesla
He's saying it's over. Tesla and the market are done. Quitting job? Tesla done. "You'll love the drop" Stock drop.
Is there still a Tesla lawyer approving his tweets? Id love to see the cutting room floor
Tesla implodes all hedge funds get margin called, all businesses get converted to taco bells like in demolition man, which ironically involved autopiloting cars and metaverse sex
Hrs not a CEO, his official title is techno-king of tesla
Can't sleep.  Calculating my tesla put profits at every price down to 700.
The funniest thing is the kicker, that Elon just tweeted he is thinking of splitting..  from his job at Tesla.  What a kick in the balls!!
Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Tesla make up slightly more than 25% of the market cap of SPY.Their sizes, combined, are larger than the GDP of every country on the face of the earth except the U.S. and China.More importantly, the performance of these six companies has driven the index to its 25% gain this year. In the meantime, there are literally hundreds of companies in the S&ampP index which are down 10% and 20% and more from their highs.
&gt (12/9- Elon done selling)He not done selling (based on the latest SEC forms posted on Tesla... 20 or 30% to go)
12/9 is my Birthday. Yay me.I spent my money on cocaine and hookers instead of Tesla.No regrets.
HELL YES. but please wait till after you publicly quit tesla to tweet more shit so the stock doesnt crash when you tweet something stupid.
Elon just caused Tesla to dip tomorrow
Remember that guy who placed a bunch of money in calls, betting on a Tesla stock split tonight, before it dropped under $1000?Pepperidge farm remembers.
^literally this. I worked in a warehouse and saved, (i could have got a better job in coding since i studied software engineering but i wanted to do things a different way ) and while i was working i looked for only 10x gains and very little downside. It took me...3 years to find something better than tesla? Then i found options and ohhhh buddy fuck me sideways. I sold all my tesla (wife told me to never sell our tesla shares but she trusted me, so i said yolo) and bought gme shares and options. I made a shit ton the first go around. Sold my shares at the literal fucking top at $500 intraday. And the proceeded to then make smart and dumb bets for the next year. I stopped being 1000x times risky and just went for 100x times risky. I made it out the rat race and i just want to help others and give back to my community. Happy trading!
My Tesla calls aren‚Äôt looking so good
&gt tesla is done‚Ä¶ Elon has been selling.:Dyes, it's all over... he is exercising options and selling stock, to get more shares.  Literally end-times.
Tesla will split. I intend to catch it. This loss is just part of the price of entry. I‚Äôll probably buy 4-6 week 30% OTM calls every second Tuesday of the month and hold until Friday until we split though (because board meetings happen then). You know the split is coming. You just don‚Äôt know when.
Than Tesla moons
That‚Äôs awesome perspective, thank you. You know you were late to Tesla at 200, no wait, 400, no wait, 800, no wait that‚Äôs not right, 1500, no hold on, 2000 before the split, no wait 500 after split, no wait‚Ä¶
So you thought it would be good idea to bet on tesla overtaking microsoft, google, amazon and apple by march? Someone give this guy a retard flair.
someone check on the guy who bought 420k of tesla calls
saw a chart that arkks at 50 without tesla just wild
Tesla cyber truck is uglier then cashflows dog.... by far
yup. *musk tweets eggplant + donut* WSB: ‚ÄúOMG TESLA IS ABOUT TO GET FUCKED‚Äù
What sucks is that some stocks are down 50-90% while some keep going up Meta, Apple, Netflix, Tesla, Amazon and Google. You heard it first here ‚ÄúMANTAG‚Äù!
Just had 29% top end growth‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre focused on being a growth stock, and it‚Äôs growing. Pretty much exactly why I‚Äôm invested and will continue to do so. I‚Äôm always curious why this stock engenders so much hate rage on this sub. I don‚Äôt see nearly as many üåàüêªcome out of the woodwork for other stocks. Shit take Tesla, with WSB darling papa musk. Took a decade+ to become profitable, each time they sell a 50k car they add another 5m to market cap, and while the üêªüåà come out of the basement to complain about it, it doesn‚Äôt get half the rage boner. Despite it operating in a market where profit margins are notoriously thin. I‚Äôd say gme is worth exactly $156 right now given current market sentiment. And the current market sentiment does not give a fuck about what you think. Me? I‚Äôm getting set to buy some calls toward the end of December to ride the next mysterious 50% pump that seems to happen with alarming regularity for this stock. Despite the fact that shorts covered. And I‚Äôm holding my shares for the next several years because I believe that there‚Äôs a lot of room to grow. And I‚Äôm enjoying getting the discount for doing this. Let the rage flow through you. Keeps making me money, and I‚Äôm a superstitious person.
Imagine believing that a company such as Ford, that currently makes a multitude of models way more intricate and difficult to produce than the typical electric car wont be able to solve a supply chain issue that will plague anyone currently entering the space en masse.This gets into something I have said for years (as a guy who likes cars) and what will ultimately lead to Tesla being an afterthought in the electric car space.    Tons of other car companies, that have been making cars for decades, will enter the space as soon as its becomes viable technologically.  Putting batteries and electric motors in an automobile is not difficult, the battery technology is difficult. Anyone who knows anything mechanically about ICE cars knows this is the case...Wellllll. We are almost there (frankly due to Tesla and Elon) and Tesla's car rank bottom of the barrel when it comes to percieved manufacturing quality (panel gaps, interior fit and finish, etc.).  Other companies figured this shit out a long time ago and are going to easily adapt batteries and electric motors to their cars (see Audi and Ford with the new Lightning). They have the scale, the manufacturing capability, consistency and brand recognition to take over a ton of market share.  Especially with electrics that people want to buy, like an electric version of the already hugely successful F150.
Well the guy that loaded up on Tesla calls got his 5% day, just in the other direction üòÇ
Tesla split‚Ä¶ these cheeks. rip my calls
I can't be bullish on TSLA after owning a Tesla.Dogshit car.
This is the way - I use the Tesla screen to trade stonks
Tax writeoff the tesla as a work vehicle!
Imagine using every dollar you made to buy a car then IRS comes knocking on your door for their part and all you have to show is the Tesla and no tax money lol
My Maintenance costs on my Tesla model x with 70k miles.  1500 bucks for tiresMy maintenance costs on my Porsche 911 with 38k miles over $10k this year on all sorts of shit.
Forget to pay taxes on investment but pay a buttload for tesla, this guy belongs here.
He did‚Ä¶apparently he bought a Tesla or is the last picture just a random one?
Smells fishy.  Also how much did OP leave for taxes after ordering that Tesla ü§£ü§£
Yes buy that tesla no need to pay taxes. Fuck the IRS
Looks like about $5k left after your Tesla you piece of garbage
He took the rational approach, Tesla is significantly overvalued if anything. If the market was this easy he wouldn't be working for you at all!
There are actually good plays out there like tesla PayPal and Nvidia and I‚Äôm over here fucking with gme and chewy puts lol
Imagine not knowing how to use ratios for analysis.GME price to sales is 2, Tesla price to sales is 24. So 12x upside. Strong buy.
I asked my financial guy to put $50,000 into Tesla about 3 years ago. He talked me out of it. I asked to do it again last March. He convinced me to only add $5,000. Then to sell back 70% of it when it doubled. Every single time I see a Tesla on the road, I point it out. So much so that my 4 year old has started to be able to pick them out. So I hear you. In all seriousness, I would look into counseling. Maybe even behind basic therapy and seek out some DBT or even EMDR. I mean it. Grief is a mental health issue. I wish you all the luck.
Elon is gonna have all of the Tesla groupies blue balling all day dropping tweets like ‚Äúbig announcement by end of day‚Äù and then 5 minutes after the market closes, he‚Äôs gonna announce he‚Äôs releasing his own signature line of denim.
It's Tesla. Elons haircut is gonna be the central theme of the report.
I guess no st9ck split tomorrowI hope to God the market doesn't give a shit about that and tesla still goes on a Santa rally
Li-ion 2170 cells, which Lucid uses, have two strips of electrodes (anode and cathode) wrapped in a roll, with a separator strip between them that allows the ions to move through, but not electricity and an insulating strip around the outside (e.g. should be 4 strips, that result in, insulating layer, electrode, separator, electrode... as you roll the insulating layer will then be the next layer and restart this order). There is electrolyte somewhere in the middle there that helps the ions move from one electrode to the other electrode.In 2170 cells, as Tesla uses, at the end of each of the electrode strips is a metal tab welded which connects to the circuit and allows electrons to flow (i.e. electricity). The electrons  move into or out of the electrodes and through the circuit in opposite ways depending on whether the cell is charging or discharging. The flow of the electrons through the electrodes has resistance which generates significant heat and causes significant energy losses. It also reduces the amount the cells can be depleted as the electrons have to overcome the resistance for electricity to flow.If you can reduce that resistance, there is less heat generated with the movement of the electrons, which results in greater efficiency. It would also allow you to charge a cell faster. You may also get a capacity increase as the cells should be able to discharge to a lower voltage as less resistance to overcome. You also get a power increase, since you can move more electrons before heat builds up.Tesla, is attempting do do this with 4680 cells, that have a continuous tab as opposed to a single tab at the end. As the 4680 cells are larger, I think you might be limited by how fast you want to discharge as heat will build up just due to sheer number of electrons  moving (although may be improved over 2170 still), but you should gain the efficiency improvements. The continuous tab, is a challenging design and for various reasons, might not be feasible to do with 2170 cells. The larger diameter 4680 cells, I think better allows for that design choice.Lucid, uses 2170 cells, but their  efficiency claims and more critically their charging rate, strongly indicates the efficiency is gained at the cell level and not the rest of the drive train. LCID has implied that their efficiency is due to their "Wunderbox" and their miniaturized electronics and so on, and has never once talked about the actual battery. However, all their claims, don't really explain how you can charge a 2170 faster without excessive wear. To do that, I think you MUST design the cell itself differently.Lucid, has said they cool their cells from the ends and not from the side (like Tesla does). Again, that is another indication that the cell is fundamentally different, since it does not seem likely that Tesla's 2170 cells would allow for sufficient heat to be removed by the ends.Putting this all together, the simplest explanation I can come up with, is Lucid  has a special manufacturing line for their 2170 cells, where instead of welding tabs at the ends, there are tabs welded periodically across the strip. Such a cell design is more complex and would result in a slower run rate and likely lower yields, due to errors with welding tabs. Doing this, would, I think, explain everything about how Lucid does what they do.I am not saying this is a bad thing, what I am saying, is this is likely not a scalable solution and likely costs much more. It would seriously call into question any possibility of Lucid bringing their battery tech to lower priced vehicles ever (even if they could somehow scale up production) as the cost will always be too much.Sorry a bit long. I may be wrong here... Just a matter of time before the details of exactly what Lucid does are known for certain.
80% of my 300K folio is in palantir. &amp#x200Bbut palantir isn't run by an ex-tesla employee that got fired for being trash lol.
lol isnt fisker the guy that elon fired from tesla for being a garbage designer?
Idiot, everyone including all the whales are jumping in and trying to push apple up to $200 but yet you buy puts? Did you not learn from Tesla $1000 last month? Being üåà don‚Äôt pay longer than a day or 2
Can you imagine if it‚Äôs Tesla and that‚Äôs what 12/9 is all about? Lmao
who‚Äôs got tesla 12/10
Tesla won‚Äôt announce split till after hours tomorrow
People buying Apple here are the people who bought Tesla at 1200.  Godspeed!
AMD was in trouble when they were at $2. You made 400%.  If you had purchased at the start of Ryzen when Youtubers started to like AMD again and giving it attention it would have a different kind of bet.  I sold $50,000 (avg cost) of Tesla @ $1650... PRE-SPLIT. Cause Elon was start to scare the shit out of me.    Could have gone the other way around.  My first years stuff like this used to pissed me off and create huge mofo, I just ignore noise now and don't break my strategies and exit plans, even when it means I could have make more, it could also have made less.  Market is a shit storm currently.   Anyway TLDR Don't overthink it and don't chastise yourself for taking profits.
10 upvotes and I will YOLO my portfolio for the tesla split
&gt Tesla is a great company and I am bullish on their stock.
&gtThis sub grew to what it is today fighting rich billionairs who steal from the little guy but why let Tesla do that to their consumers?Lmao WSB grew to 11m subs because everyone saw teenagers on tik tok making gains in meme stocks. Please take the social justice nonsense out of here, everyone in the market has the same goal of making money.
When I saw this picture the first time, my first thought is that when Elon announces Zorg Industries as the parent company of Tesla, Space X, The Boring Company, etc, shit is going to get real weird.
Don't think he's gotten bailout money? There was a 465 million loan for Tesla they paid back. SpaceX got it's ass saved by winning a contract from NASA - not the same as bailout money.  And they've gotten very close, but he hasn't actually gone bankrupt, either.
This has to be the dumbest post ever. Not sure if OP was being sarcastic.First off this place isn't for fighting billionaires. That's just leftist reddit justifying itself for gambling and trying to push a stock.Second apple literally uses slave labor to make their phones. The whole seat warmer thing is tesla is trying to expand production as fast as possible you know to try and curb a small thing called climate change. If they make separate individual hardware it's slower and costs them more.
Ur retarded and not in the wsb way.This sub is not about fighting billionaires. Its about getting money no matter what.Apple is one of the gods of shady business practices lmao. All big companies are. Tesla doing scummy shit is what we need. Cutthroat practices make the most money. Thats what we want.
Where‚Äôs the guy who put like 400k+ on Tesla calls for the split? üíÄ
so tesla china numbers were pretty bad huh
Yeah OP is dropping FUD.Tesla is on track for a 50% CAGR into 2030.

WHO IS BULLISH ON TESLA TODAY? Come on 1100 baby!

I can't believe Tesla release flamethrower, teslaquila, other shit but didn't do an Elon Mask?? in an ongoing pandemic where there's a Mask mandate?
&gt Tesla is not an auto company. It's a technology company that builds electric cars.
Every time someone starts an argument against Tesla and begins with the premise that it's an auto company I ignore the rest.
I say this at least once a week. All these new ‚Äúapes‚Äù thinking they know ‚Äúwhat this sub is about‚Äù when they clearly don‚Äôt know shit. We‚Äôre degenerate gamblers. We‚Äôre retards. We‚Äôve been throwing money at Tesla for YEARS. None of this ‚Äúbuy for the little guy‚Äù shit.
Tim AppleElon Tesla
&gtThis sub grew to what it is today fighting rich billionairs who steal from the little guy but why let Tesla do that to their consumers?Before Covid19, this sub was a bunch of somewhat smart but odd doofuses who played options on various companies and often had legitimate DD to back it up.   I'm talking about fairly thoughtful ideas, not just stupid rocketship emoji and bananas.   The place was a lot smaller too.  I remember when we hit 1.7m subs.  It was a pretty big deal and it already felt like it was getting kind of crowded.After Covid19, we got naive and/or brainwashed normies who wanted to 'fight the power' and 'hold the line' against elites mixed with others who saw everything as a potential short squeeze.  Lazy money because it was so easy.  These people pushed out many of the regulars, some who actually knew their stuff and contributed quality DD and reasonable potential plays.So I'm not sure that this sub growing beyond what it was could ever really be considered a positive.  Plus it put this place on the map it was quiet and relatively unknown to most.  I caught the tail end of that, but I still miss it.I'm all for ethical trading.  I don't play TSLA (and a few other major companies) for my own reasons.  But I think most here really simply want to make money, even if long term those plays really harm them or their society.  For most it's entirely about the short term for the self, Not the long term for the community.  This is how most major corporations seem to play it as well.  As a result, I don't think you're going to get much traction here, even if I applaud you for taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture on what and who you are funding.

Some guy on here just yoloed 94k on tesla puts, qqq puts, andvxx calls. That's gonna hurt tomorrow.
Been trying to off myself with my Tesla in my garage for like 20 minutes now
How many of them want to own a Tesla versus how many wish holders want to do their shopping on wish?
I'm guessing this guy is already set for life even if tesla hits $0.
Mine would be Elon. I would put my whole net worth into TSLA puts and tweet "Leaving Tesla"
You‚Äôre just running the 2nd leg of ‚Äúthe wheel‚Äù. This is smart, why not make nice premium while you wait for it to go up? I would just suggest using premium money for other trades. Tesla is stretched and could go down eventually. $37k into Apple or Microsoft is a good idea.
No doubt. OP makes it sounds like they‚Äôre cool holding long term, but TSLA ‚Äúcould‚Äù correct 50% and not reach current levels ever again. TSLA is not the American economy, it can be important, innovative, and eventually bankrupt or archaic. Unlike the market as a whole, Tesla doesn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúalways‚Äù go up.
If you have 700 shares if Tesla you can literally do anything other than sell and you‚Äôll be fine for eternity
Musk said he would give a product update on next earnings call. And I think your call expires after the call, most likely. It might be too risky.If I were you, I will close the position on a down day. I am sure there will be one.I did the same mistake once in 2015 with Tesla, and I thought I was okay if I get assigned at that price. Boy o boy, I missed a huge upside potential. I was newbie at that time. I don't know what I was doing.Few rules now I follow while selling options:1. 30-45 days out max2. Strike price must be outside 1 standard deviation move away.3. No big event like product release or earning call before expiry.4.Sell the cover call only on a green day, and it has move up atleast 5 days up in the past 7 days trading. You close position on the next big red days.4th point is personal discretionary. Again. I don't sell cover call on my core holding like, it's not worth the headache and tax bill for a small gain. But I do sell cover call on my other stocks based on those guidelines.
Imagine if we got to cheat too? Fred from Michigan has decided to hold trading on Tesla this morning. Joe and Bobby decided to trade pennys back and forth to manipulate Google today.
I just don't get the EV companies (Tesla + Rivian + Lucid + Nio) having like 1.2T total market cap, when basically every car other company combined have like $800B total market cap. How the fuck does that add up? The margins aren't going to be THAT much higher. And the traditional automakers are going to compete in the EV market as well. People only need a limited number of cars. That number isn't going to randomly shoot up drastically. It just makes no fucking sense.
Edison and Nikola Tesla were fighting to provide electricity. Edison went on a smear campaign of Tesla. Edison was backed by JP Morgan. Nikola Tesla was backed by George Westinghouse. Tesla‚Äôs electricity was cheaper and won more contracts and got a huge one for Niagara Falls. JP Morgan threatened Westinghouse with a bs lawsuit and Westinghouse signed over Tesla‚Äôs AC parents to him.
&gtSold fucking everything and put it into long-term Tesla puts. Bro, that's the most senseless way to lose money. $TSLA will bury you, RIP.
will my tesla March calls go to shit after nothing happens on 12/09?I got fucked on battery day after being so fucking excited about it for a month prior to it
&gt You could have said the same things about Apple when they hit 1T a few years ago‚Ä¶ sure, if you ignore the massive difference between the two companies‚Ä¶ Apple had at that point in time already a very long track record of:- innovating - selling products at great margins - building multiple revenue streams and slowly diversifying them You can argue Tesla is innovating, but they don‚Äôt have a long history of building diverse revenue streams and selling products for high margins.
Yeah, after running up a thousand percent I totally expect it to double in no time. The fact Tesla bleeds sales in Europe is bullish and the whistleblower saying their solar panels are outright bad is a sure sign of profit. /s

I would like to thank the guy who ‚Äòwished me luck‚Äô on buying Tesla calls this morning. It worked
If Tesla goes to 900, I will scoop doodoo out of my asscrack and lick it.
Tesla ends above $1000 = bullish
And Tesla very nearly went bankrupt twice.
I can't wait to dress like a lumberjack in the metaverse while a Tesla bot fucks me in the ass.
The people buying nudes on of for $100 are the same people buying Tesla rn
Funny how people think it‚Äôs easy to manufacture cars just because Tesla did it. In the whole history of America, only Ford and Tesla made it to today without becoming bankrupt.
u/Kooky_Minimum_8022&gtTesla probably!RemindMe 1 year
Arguably you could basically have bought Tesla at any point and you would pretty much have always been right (except maybe the last couple months but that probably won't be for long)But yea man congrats. Always feels good when the option plays out how you thought it would.

Tesla and Apple were carrying the previous rally.Premarket says rip.
Somebody blasts the horn twice, Tesla is below $1000!  Wildlings are attacking.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about Tesla?
Yeah I get it. I‚Äôm a big fan of EVs. But horse and carriage vs a Model T comparison only works if there isn‚Äôt a dozen other manufacturers ramping up the competition.I know bringing a vehicle to market takes a good 7 years or so, traditionally, and that Tesla has had a nice head start because of much less bureaucratic overhead, but one of these days‚Ä¶ (lol) one of these days the competition will be fierce.I‚Äôm just saying there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm holding TSLA at a trillion dollar EV. They have a first mover advantage, but electric motors and batteries, in a huge, 3 ton, cumbersome, low margin, costly af to ship vehicle isn‚Äôt the next iphone.
Yeah it‚Äôs really hard to compare, but tesla as a company is worth 2.5x Toyota, but Toyota makes about 20 cars / minute while Tesla makes about 0.7 cars per minute. That‚Äôs 3.5% of the production for 2.5x the value. There‚Äôs a serious gap there.Not saying Tesla is bad or anything. They‚Äôre completely different companies with totally different strategies. But there does seem to be some degree of an arbitrate play there.
I agree, but the issue here is that the market prices in technology waaay too early. The dot com boomers were totally correct on the value the Internet would bring to our daily lives. They were just way too early. Same with TSLA investors. How does Tesla justify a trillion dollar EV (feels weird saying EV here). EVs are ***clearly*** the future, but the industry has a lot of work to do before we *really* go mainstream.Premature booms and subsequent painful busts are very common.
"You want a stock tip? From me? You know, back when Hugh Hefner was still alive, we used to make it rain with paper share certificates at his private gentleman's clubs. Right around the time Tesla had its IPO we threw hundreds of shares around this group of tight college babes. I wonder how much those shares were worth by the time they sold them. I'm sorry, did you ask me something? I can't remember what we were talking about."-Warren Buffett

This sub is just gambling addicts. You don't go into a Christian sub and tell people god isn't real, and you don't come in here and tell people not to yolo their life savings on Tesla calls.
I can't wait to dress like a lumberjack in the metaverse while a Tesla bot fucks me in the ass.
Tesla are stupid, i'd easily pay 8 bucks a share.
More accurately:&gtThis is not news to anyone who scratched the surface of the storyWe live in a world where most people won't even read an article, nevermind read anything beyond that to find out what's really happening in any depth.Many people following Tesla even vaguely closely knew this. The Tesla subreddit here called it days if not hours after this all started. Most people don't want to do that, they want to do the minimum possible to form an opinion, any opinion, especially if it means they can hate a billionaire.Musk knows this.
Yes. &gt	So far he's sold 10.1 million shares‚Ä¶ At the same time he is selling shares, he's also exercising options to buy additional stock. And he's doing so at a bargain exercise price of $6.24 a share, well below 1% of Tesla's current share price. Since Musk's Twitter poll on November 6, he has exercised options to buy 10.7 million shares of Tesla. To be clear, he would have done so with or without the poll ‚Äî the options were due to expire by August of 2022 if he didn't exercise them.
We got it I‚Äôm going all in Tesla Monday, I love Elon and believe in his company.
Call incoming,  cybertruck due to release, space x incoming ipoAnd cyber robot breaking the market.Tesla 2500$ by end of 2022 and split. 2:1.
I am probably executing a buy on her ARKG fund. I will wait for Tesla to crash before I buy any fund which holds it.
6 slices X $3.89 is $23.34 (94.5% over full pie price). So Tesla should hit $1,960 shortly after split announcement.
Odd for Tesla to be #1 on customer satisfaction yet be the 2nd worst on reliability...considering EVs in general are much more reliable than gas cars i would guess the autoblog data is bad.  ive had a model 3 going on 70k miles without one problem to date, owned over 10 cars in my life now and not even the best Japanese models beat my Tesla in reliability
Tesla 1100 tomorrow
Not financial advice, just my thoughts:  Tesla stock is absurdly overvalued if you think of it as a automobile company.  Tesla stock only begins to make sense if you are betting on it revolutionizing the whole automobile industry OR if you are literally making a bet and intend to sell higher than you bought, IE: playing casino.  I have no idea about the car. But I have thought " I wish I had a Tesla", withouth knowing anything about the car. Means their branding is very strong.
My thousands aren't hard earned money either. They are from calls on tesla and from my tenants rents. Can I throw some at Chinese stocks?
Truth!!!  Can‚Äôt believe these posts keep happening.  If we all knew how to recoup your damn money we‚Äôd all be rich already.Oh yeah, and buy Tesla puts because those always work.
I lost $6,000 on a Tesla put, threw everything I had left  into a 2dte SPY put and made $7,000. Extremely lucky, but I could‚Äôve been like you
He's talking about the car, not the stock. If he just mentioned it's the best car he ever had, what would it matter if some guy on the internet said that the quality standard is low?I have a feeling you have never owned a Tesla or a Mercedes EV, but you feel the need to have a strong opinion so you can 'own the fanboys'.
Buy 3 shares of Tesla 8 shares of Apple and delete the app
He could have bought 2 Tesla model 3s, and given me 1. Instead he flushed the money down the drain =[
Foolish bear tesla 2k eoy
Except when it's announced that Elon is done selling the same week build back better passes and Tesla announces stock split and it hits all time highs because shorts get screwed again.... I don't have anything in Tesla it's just seems to happen like that a lot...
&gt [Tesla was the only brand with an asterisk that stated: ‚ÄúTesla did not allow its vehicle owners to be surveyed, so it did not technically meet J.D. Power‚Äôs ranking criteria, but the study leaders independently obtained enough data to give the brand a score.‚Äù Could this be another reason for the low ranking?](https://insideevs.com/news/489178/tesla-bombs-jd-powers-dependability-study/) and&gt [It now places 27th out of 28 manufacturers \(the same as last year\), with vehicles like the Model Y being present on CR‚Äôs list of 10 least reliable cars. The smaller Tesla crossover has a reliability rating of just 18, which makes it slightly more reliable than a Volkswagen Tigua, but slightly less reliable than Chrysler Pacifica. CR wasn‚Äôt any kinder on the Model X, pointing to its falcon wing doors as a constant source of problems.](https://insideevs.com/news/549130/consumerreports-tesla-reliability-poor-2021/amp/)I didn't know the reliability issues were quite so bad, and Tesla trying to keep their own customers quiet about it isn't a good look at all.
Tesla made 1.6 billion in 2020 by selling CO2 certificates....that's not really a product
The 3 is pretty reliable, I think the other models (Y/S/X) do have a lot of reliability problems, especially given their price range. https://insideevs.com/news/549130/consumerreports-tesla-reliability-poor-2021/amp/
If this goes to $500, I'll sell everything I own to buy more Tesla. I'll go on margin. I'll borrow from friends/family.  I'll have a g'damn garage sale and a bake sale...with bonus HJsI have 1230 shares currently and would kill to add more at that price
Tesla technically is not growing exactly ‚Äúexponentially‚Äù I just used that in the sentence to annoy you. But if you look at the chart from all, it very much is exponentially growing
Tesla is growing exponentiallyMore and more will buy as the price falls
Lmao there are an exponential amount of people and institutions that would buy this stock every $50 it dropsToo much buying pressure my guy, itll take an entire market crash to keep Tesla down long
from what I hear about Tesla reliability, this was a smaller headache in the long run.
Tesla is one of the biggest Ponzi's in stock exchange market. Do you really believe that TESLA &gt ALL OTHER car manufacturers.
You could‚Äôve bought Tesla model S instead.
Tesla actually produces anything of value. Hell, it's completely transforms at least one entire market.
This is argument based on returns.  Why do Bitcoin for 300% when Tesla grew 500%?
But that‚Äôs not a safe haven from deflation. Bitcoin is just going up. If you picked other years you could choose one that performed worse than gold. It‚Äôs like saying Tesla stock is a haven from inflation because it‚Äôs up 10x from 5 years ago. You made up a conclusion to fit your data.
I had a Tesla call I sold for 4k go for 15k a few months ago and I have that same PTSD. I don‚Äôt even check Tesla much anymore because I kept losing money trying to chase after. I need some time to reflect lol.
&gt And the 40% revenue increase isn't sustainable either. Micron is also overpriced,The thing with NVDA is that their retail products could be sold for a lot more if they wanted to, there's a shortage constantly and customers are willing to pay twice or thrice as much as retail stores charge them, meanwhile NVDA doesn't sell their products for a very high price to retail sellers, they do most of the mark up.Intel and NVDA are not good comparisons. Intel's 2000 valuation was a joke (dot com bubble) and they're losing the CPU battle against AMD (have been losing market share for 5 years and many big companies such as Facebook and Tesla are going for AMD instead of Intel), hence why they're not growing too much when it comes to valuation. Intel's valuation was ridiculous, the tech market is a lot bigger now and during this prime tech time Intel is slowly losing at all fronts, hence why their valuation isn't skyrocketing.
FacebookAmazonGoogleAppleTesla
And held onto it. A lot of people I know bought Tesla super low, but when they were up 50~100% they obviously sold.Don't think a lot of people expected it to go this high.
Chewy is down a lot, but they are still crazy high valued, and growth seems to be slowing. I see them as more of a COVID play than a more general e-commerce like Amazon, and I feel like Amazon can eat a lot of their business, so the growth potential seems limited. Also the chart is looking terrible for them as well. Even a little downward pressure and they could drop to 50. Really bad news and the 40s would be a target.They are e-commerce with a 2000-3000 PE. That is Tesla levels of PE for pet supplies. I feel like Petco and Petsmart will also be expanding hard on their delivery services. Not to mention the overall growth in Grocery and club stores like Costco and Sam's Club will ad even more pressure. And I think that is part of why the growth seems to be slowing. I think Chewy is gunna eat it.
First. Stay off WallStreetBets until you‚Äôre old enough to ruin your life. Next, yes. 1k is plenty. You are young , time is on your side - I‚Äôd suggest going all in on VOO and adding monthly. When applicable , pick up some apple, Microsoft , NVIDIA, Tesla , amongst others. Even just partial shares. Remember , time is your friend. Not financial advice. I‚Äôm actually drunk.
I had a TSLA Jan 22 $700 Call option, got for a little over $5K on late June.Felt pretty good when I flipped it for $8K‚Ä¶I hit a high of $70k in Oct, goes like $50K right now‚Ä¶I get PTSD every time I see a Tesla on the road. I wonder if this is what Tesla Shorts feel ??
This is a troubling time to start.  Even a month ago it was way more stable.  My advice is to stick to big names.  your apples and tesla, stuff that gets a lot of public attention and thus opinions.Start by learning how to value a stock, then pick out a few winners to track until you feel comfortable.Then dunk your money in.  Just learn to tell the difference between taking a bet and making an investment.  A lot of this 'moon and tendie' shit is people chasing the dragon.
YOLO tesla puts. It's been going up all year it can't go up forever. Trust me OP
I appreciate your informative comment and reasoning in there, so will try to do my best.There are many valuation models out there that shows why Tesla is valued at where it is currently. Tesla's current guidance is \~50% CAGR on vehicle production/delivery for the next 10 years reaching 20M cars in 2030. If you consider 20M vehicle delivery with average sale price of \~60k and an operating profit of \~16% then Tesla's market cap will become \~4 Trillion. I am not including any outrageous FSD revenue or robotaxi and all that. Most expect operating margin to increase, from current levels as the company grows. There was actually [a good post on](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/) Tesla's valuation on r/stocks so that might be helpful too. Some people have commented TSLA is a meme stock. It definitely is, but that's not the reason behind the valuation. Valuation is mostly due to earnings growth expectations, and growth history in the past.Now coming to Toyota. I am not saying Toyota will be bankrupt tomorrow, but they will probably bleed slowly, unless they make radical transformation to their business strategy. Strangely, they have shown very little effort to transform their business into the new world of EVs, despite once being leader with their Prius lineup. They have constantly talked about Hydrogen and [secretly lobbied against EVs](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/). They do make a lot of money selling Ice cars, but that will decline as the world transitions to EVs. And as that transition happens, the developed countries will switch to EVs first, thus sale of the most profitable vehicles will dwindle. Based on what I have researched, most legacy manufacturers can't make EVs with much profit, [recently confirmed by Stellantis CEO](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-ceo-says-ev-cost-burden-is-beyond-limits-automakers-2021-12-01/). I expect major problems with legacy automakers, layoffs, strikes, management changes etc etc and this has already started [happening in some](https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/volkswagen-weighing-up-ceos-future-report). Now, the pace with which this will happen is debatable, but I am betting it will be faster than most expect. It didn't take the developed world much time to switch to iPhones. It will happen as fast as EV makers can ramp up production.
just got my tesla cyberwhistle and it whistles weak afcalls on TSLA for making idiots like me buy this shit
Volkswagen sells the second most EVs and their PE is 7.  Tesla is a meme stock.
Tesla, who owes their entire existence at this point to taking advantage of government funds and credits is a god send...GM is government motors. The irony.
If you invested $50k in Tesla when this was filmed you‚Äôd be a millionaire by now
So Toyota has a $295 B market cap with a PE ratio of 9.24 ($32 Billion earnings). And Tesla has a market cap of $1020 B with a PE ratio of 329.36 ($3.1 Billion in earnings). In order for TSLA at the current price to be equivalent value to what TM is today, they'd have to grown their earnings 35.6X. How fast do you think they will be able to do that? In order for them to be a better investment than Toyota, they'd have to do significantly better than that or Toyota would have to do significantly worse in a reasonable amount of time.Low chance TM will go bankrupt in the next century with $32 billion in profit as the world's leading auto manufacturer. You're also probably thinking the global shift to EVs will happen much faster than it actually will. I already drive a 2017 Volt and my next car will be full EV, but even I can see wide spread adoption won't happen for at least 5-10 years. And you're probably over valuing TSLA's moat. Everyone will be making EVs in 5 years (Toyota is launching one next year, and they also launched full EVs decades ago in California). In 10 years I doubt TSLA will be selling the most EVs.
The ONLY reason it‚Äôs outperforming is because of one fucking stock lol. Tesla.
The split won't inherently cause the price to increase, but the increased accessibility would. There are a lot of buyers that can't or won't buy Tesla at $1000 but would buy in at $200, valuation be damned.
Tesla 2k eoy, spy 500 eoy
Buy 15k worth of Tesla in 2019
Tesla having 3-4x the market cap of Toyota is pretty wild.
I'm not convinced people actually think Tesla has this much value. It's just what it is currently trading at. I own it because I think people are idiots, not because I think the company is worth that much.
&gt But Cathie doesn‚Äôt let that natural process take place. She constantly sells Tesla on up days to dilute her funds with other stocks, that may not be nearly as strong. This destroys the entire purpose of a 5 year plan. Because her fund holds really large stakes in a lot of fairly illiquid small tech stocks.On the way up, when they saw huge amounts of new cash coming into the fund, putting huge amounts of money into these relatively illiquid tech stocks drove prices up dramatically, but now that they're facing redemptions, they either have to sell off their illiquid trash and take a big loss on that, or they can sell their more liquid names and use the money to buy more illiquid trash, which drives the price of those names up temporarily and helps to stop the bleeding.This is made worse because Nikko [also markets a fund mirroring ARKs positions](https://en.nikkoam.com/institutional/equity-strategies/nikko-am-ark-disruptive-innovation-strategy) and Sumitomo Mitsui (who own Nikko) also mirrors these positions further.So now, they're stuck with some really huge stakes in some quite illiquid names, for example PagerDuty:https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PD/holders?p=PDARKK + Nikko + Sumitomo own &gt25% of the shares, or ~30% of the float. The stock trades an average of 1.1 million shares per day, and these funds between them own &gt22 million shares.The funds can't easily sell a big part of their stake in any sort of hurry, because trying to sell several times the average daily volume would certainly crash the price. Therefore when they see significant redemptions, the only thing they *can* do is sell liquid stuff like TSLA.
Why does OP think Tesla will announce a stock split on December 9 in particular?
I did. Sorry if not everyone got it.. https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/nabnrv/cathie_wood_deep_dive_into_her_20_year/Since that post, I'm realizing now that things are even worse than I thought. Cathie's AUM weighted returns are now terrible. Average dollar invested is under performing. The only reason performance still looks good when zoomed out is because early investors benefited from the rise in prices caused by Ark's later investors.Put it this way, Cathie didn't pick stocks that go up (other than Tesla). Most her early performance was from Tesla and BTC. This drove inflows. Those inflows she then pumped into growth stocks without any regard to the price she was paying. **The price went up *because* she was a whale buyer**, and buying them up at any price as she received inflows. Now this is all reversing as folks dump Ark. Her holdings are dropping because folks are abandoning the ETF and it forces her to sell.
No such thing as overvalued. Value is just whatever people think has value. And people are retards so Tesla has a high value.That being said, sell the PS5 you bought for little Tyler's Christmas gift and tell him daddy loves Elon more
Haha tesla will always be overvalued to some because they can‚Äôt afford to buy any.
OP seems to be referencing this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qyoqoo/tesla\_stock\_split\_conspiracy\_theory/
I really find it extremely retarded to buy 1milli in Tesla at 1100 usd. Like really really fucking stupid
Didn't tesla split around the current price last time?
I sold my Tesla puts on tuesday for $800 profit. Worth 70k today ü§°
Tesla calls free money. Free money to whoever sold it to you, I mean.
Dude Ford can produce their own cars as effeciently because they have had the best car-building infrastructure and process for over 100 years. Add in the two mega battery factories that will add 25,000 American jobs and it's clear Ford has a road map to not only compete with Tesla, but genuinely size it's market shared. Their pickup will absolutely outsell the cyber truck because Elon ego made a weird vehicle with niche appeal. Why do you think Fords EV F-150 has pre-sales in gargantuan figures? The company that made the first car ever, are now pivoting with their resources and experience, towards EV and Tesla and now there are multiple gladiators in the arena.
I had finally got to 1mil and decided to put it in Tesla
You couldn't yolo tesla when it was 6 hundred or even 800? You had to go in on 1.1k. Wild.
Since you're holding shares and not options, I honestly don't think you have anything to worry about. Tesla has set the standard for EVs and although there's competitors, they aren't able to produce their own cars as efficiently or offer them as cheaply as Tesla. I see it being the "EV Brand" just like everyone running out to buy that new iPhone Everytime AAPL puts one out. Market has been waaaaayyyyy overdue for a correction. So you'll see the price slip but I don't think it will ever drop back down where it was last Spring-Summer.
Is there any reason to believe that tesla will split again?I got in before the first split and it was pretty telegraphed. I've seen no real indications that they're planning to split again and even if they do I really doubt it's going to surge like the last one. I hope I'm wrong for the sake of your tenders and mine but I just don't see it man.
Google is the only company that's also an action.You can't Apple stuff.You can't Intel stuff.You can't Tesla stuff.You can Google everything.
Why is Cathie selling so much Tesla when her price target was $3000 a share? ü§°
wtf a Tesla cyberquad for kids for $1900
Gme stays afloat because of hype. It's massively overvalued compared to the industry it's in.But so is Tesla. so... *shrug*
take note their investing horizon is 5 years, not a weekly or month by month thing.i'm not a 5 year investor so i don't have ark, i instead swing with individual names instead like tesla apple goog amzn

How does he still have money after getting his ass handed to him by the Tesla bulls?
Tesla was always going to go up
I downgraded myself last year from 100% Tesla to 80% Tesla and now I'm back to 97% Tesla because I'm down more than 50% on anything non Tesla.Diversification is risky.
I‚Äôd like to add that SpaceX is in no way close to bankruptcy. Musk is the richest man on the planet (literally) and has demonstrated his willingness to bankroll the company out of bankruptcy before. Back when they hadn‚Äôt even launched their first successful rocket, SpaceX was actually facing bankruptcy. Musk put together the last of his wealth from the sale of PayPal (some 30 million by this point) and was able to secure one last launch that thankfully worked out. There is absolutely zero chance that the guy who put all his chips on the table to save the company before, would abandon this now that he‚Äôs the richest man on earth. It would be trivial for him to sell shares of Tesla at this point. My point being‚Ä¶. He said that sure. But I think he‚Äôs just trying to whip the workers into a frenzy and get things to happen faster.
na.. him shorting is bullish for the stock.. look at tesla
He also called Tesla...oh wait. And apparently lost 50% of his assets last year, losing about $500 million.
Tesla puts? You wear velcro shoes, don't you?
I don‚Äôt always buy Tesla options, but when I do they lose 30% of their value instantly
You can‚Äôt convince me any of this is a dip until Tesla falls below like 750
LMAO ARKK is below 100, Cathie proving  that all she was good at was Tesla.
Intel can absolutely outperform VOO.  VOO has Tesla and Nvidia and a bunch of other hugely overpriced companies in it.  When the economy slows next year, the higher the PE, the harder they will fall.  I could see Nvidia dropping 50% and Tesla 75% or more.
No worries you have Tesla to cover
I barely read your post, but saw Intel and thought it might be worth sharing one thing I know:Jim Keller is a true rockstar engineering leader in the compute architecture space. We overlapped during his time at Tesla. I worked in the small orbit around Elon, and let me tell you‚Ä¶ I have never seen Elon man crush over another person harder ‚Äî especially an employee. Jim had Elon‚Äôs complete trust and confidence and people like that can be counted on one hand.Jim left his role leading Tesla Autopilot for Intel basically because he was over it and looking for the next challenge, could have gone anywhere, and chose to go to Intel. Elon did everything possible to get him to stay. This is all to say that if an engineer of Jim Keller‚Äôs caliber, fawned over by Elon Musk, who could have gone anywhere in the world (or retired), decided to go to Intel‚Ä¶ maybe Intel is doing cool stuff and has something big up their sleeve. Now, Jim left Intel in mid 2020, so I don‚Äôt know, interpret that as you will.
There is ZERO chance that Space X goes bankrupt. Elon can personally fund it to the tune of billions, which he absolutely will, just as he did before and as he did for Tesla.
You know nothing. Tesla shares are his wealth. 43% of spacex is about 1/7th of his wealth. Also the bankruptcy news didn't make rklb pop it was the Bofa  $20 price target. You were so close but so far with this DDPositions: Jan 21, 7.5, 10, 15CShares 580Warrants 114
Tesla already down $10 in AH. I‚Äôm seriously so fucked it‚Äôs unbelievable
Yeah, those rules plus Google/Youtube downvote hiding, Facebook turning into Meta, Boston Dynamic is putting weapons on their robots, Tesla and others have remote shutoff powers over your car and its features, and Amazon's creepy fucking Black Mirroresque commercials advertising a literal spying device. Big Tech is pushing the dystopia button.We fucked boys and girls.
Yo someone wanna check on that guy who closed his million dollar tesla short to go long on baba?
They can‚Äôt do more than 3% because they can‚Äôt service the current debt. Surely all of those Tesla bulls with dcf model already priced in 3 rate hikes :)
NVDA real AI king not shity tesla
I always wonder what‚Äôs the projected revenue of Tesla without access to the Chinese market.I bet most China doomsday prophets are heavily invested in Tesla without accounting for it‚Äòs own dependence on China.In short: China doomsday prophets are either exaggerating or are disingenuous.
Will Tesla just keep going up forever? I bought puts because the valuation is absurd. Not the first person to make that mistake I reckon.......
You say that you hate people betting on cataclysmic events, yet you have puts on Tesla,  a company whose valuation will only drop in the event of a cataclysmic event. Move along bag holder #736272‚Ä¶
Part 2: Tesla becomes galactic mega corp.Part 3: Tesla helps Mars declare independence from Earth overlord.
Mark my words, Tesla won‚Äôt be remembered as an electric car company. They‚Äôll be remembered as an energy company that happens to make cars. In 10 years time I imagine the majority of their worth will come from solar and batteries.
Santa rally starts tomorrow.  Followed by the Tesla split on 12/9.  LFG!
That‚Äôs actually bc Elon tried to kill hitler before starting Tesla and it fucked some stuff up
Classic FUD article similar to ones about Tesla when it was first starting
My f150 goes from 20mpg to 8 or 9 when towing a 22ft. rv. This is normal, Tesla suv range also tanks when towing.
‚ÄúLuckily‚Äù space x and Tesla are two separate companies.  Tesla bulls would skyrocket the price of the stock if space x was included.  It‚Äôs disturbing news generally, but shouldn‚Äôt have much effect on the stock price in a sane market‚Ä¶ not that anything about our current market follows sane guidelines.
So, Elon is gonna sell more Tesla stock, become 2nd richest, pull his SpaceX shit together, launch to Mars,   IPO SpaceX with ticker SEX, become richest again.
Clown "market."  I have 40 positions that are household names, solid money making machines.  All down on average .8%, many down 10-20% already.But what's up?  Freaking Tesla.  When did investing become "buy the company that will maybe never grow into it's inflated stock price?"I guess I need to unlearn investing in companies with good numbers, making money, having markets cornered, etc?
\*Had multiple Rolex and a Tesla
Tesla to 1.2k today
From his history he has multiple Rolex and a Tesla, so you're probably right
Start by selling your Tesla, Rolex, AP watches, and then learn how to suck dicks.
The Fed's actions in March/April 2020 were decisive and huge.  They should have been done in November 2020.  The 2021 market is all the creation of the Fed and entirely unnecessary and ridiculous QE.  Tesla, GME, Cryptos, NFT's.  So many millenials think this is all different to before and they are beating the system.  All of the above would not have occurred to the same extent without an all encouraging Fed that always looks after its own.  The rich have got richer and the poor, poorer as they usually do, but in quicker fashion than any other time in history.Don't get caught holding the bag, as retail always does.
Elon: "Hey watch this. Please vote on whether I should sell my Tesla shares. I will abide by whatever the poll says"*Tesla stock drops 10% next day. Market down 0.5%....*Moderna CEO: "Hold my beer"
One thing I know is this. Don't bet against Tesla. Smarter men than me have, and gotten it wrong.
I need tesla at 1.7k if my kids are getting anything for the holidays
Tesla getting into electric bidet market.
Tesla coming out with a new brown color confirmed
Y‚Äôall ready for Tesla split?
Everyone loading up on Tesla from the rumour of a stock split next week. This is either going to end very well or very very badly lol.
Nvda amd or tesla
Due to inflation, tesla is reasonably priced.
o my god my Tesla puts are so fucked
The year is 2041. I‚Äôm at home watching TV with my wife and kids. A trailer comes on for a movie called, ‚ÄúThe Big Squeeze‚Äù. A single tear runs down my face. My wife puts her hand on my leg she knows. My kids say the want to see the movie, so we make plans to see it later that day. We get into our Tesla, in-part, powered by $BB. We‚Äôre driving down the street and pass a $GME. The kids say they really want to go there to build a new PC. Finally, we pulled into the parking lot of $AMC. As were are walking into the theater, I get a call on $APPL implant through the $NOK 5G network. It‚Äôs a call from u/deepfuckingvalue, and old friend.
Most of the favorite companies of this sub are somewhat legitimate. Tesla, AMD, Palantir all doing good job, unlike wish
You think Amazon and Tesla have shitty management teams?
Just five more hours to find out if I'll get my wife a new Tesla or another loan in her name she doesn't know about for Christmas.
Literally made up to secure the Tesla-act
Tesla is the only short position I have
Omicron and elon both from South Africa? Coincidence? Buying tesla calls
ah yes, tesla is undervalued because they are 100% gonna deliver on those sci-fi promises that keep getting delay after delay.
It's the old same battery tech Tesla uses. Tesla actually has new battery tech rolling out in some models now. I believe Tesla is probably over valued 40% but LCID is more like 75% over valued.
Or Apple is revealed to be a substantial holder of Tesla and all other cars are firmware locked out
Just think in a year they might have 1/30th the number of Tesla chargers. Truly incredible.
My friend's dad is ridiculously loaded and up until a few years ago drove a Volkswagen Jetta diesel.  He recently upgraded to a Tesla but barely drives it.  Cars don't equal wealth and most wealthy people view cars as depreciating assets and choose to spend their money elsewhere.
Tesla does have profit and revenue, it is just that the level of profit and revenue has no relation to the stock price...
A -2% change on the indices means -20% for the ultra speculative no-profit no-revenue racketeering swindling shams we all love to diamond hand thinking it‚Äôs the next Tesla.
Idk about the Tesla part, but yea the easy money policy by the FED will be around longer if Covid sticks around.
Your only hope is that Amazon buys wish for... whatever salvage wish has to over. Maybe the real estate who knows.  Just DM Jeff Bozo and tell him Elon really likes wish and is considering making it the homepage on the tesla dash screen.It'll be bought by Amazon in a day and 10x
So buy tesla?
Just buy Tesla. You have not missed Tesla. Tesla has much more runway than Rivian and Rivian will be cheaper soon.
Institutions also tend to FOMO and no one wants to miss out on next Tesla.
&gt if the ‚Äúelites‚Äù were truly concerned about this then overpriced stocks like Tesla would be nosedivingSmart money is not the reason tesla is valued at what it is.
If everyone could stop buying the dip on Tesla that would be great thanks
Whoopity do Another made up bs ‚Äúvariant‚Äù market already doesn‚Äôt care about it just like that supposed ‚Äúdelta‚Äù variant. Tesla didn‚Äôt even go to a lower low on the weekly with that news on top of all of the selling. Tesla ripping next week
NO.  The media loves its fear mongering.  ‚ÄúA couple people sick in Africa‚Äù crashing stocks that just survived lockdowns fine is ridiculous.  I wish people would stop taking the bait.  And if the ‚Äúelites‚Äù were truly concerned about this then overpriced stocks like Tesla would be nosediving
Tesla says they have a vaccine in production.
Had a lot of cash on the side last year when the market crashed. Cashed out on a lot of Tesla stocks and Bitcoin recently.
Trying to imagine what's really going on here:Portfolio managers/Finance professionals/Futures traders had a nice lil family dinner, he he ha ha jokes, all merry and joy. And then they decide to rush back home and turn on their computers and start selling."Even my retarded nephew is buying tesla shares this is the top!! Oh and covid looks bad"
Seth rogen said the car jacking and cat converter thefts are no big deal and just part of living in a big city. Thank god cause I was starting to get worried and now I realize its only a problem in my own head. Calls on EV vehicles like Toyota and tesla
"Invest in Tesla brooo, 60% pls"Can be done on WhatsApp.
Forget Nvidia, this sub can't even handle questioning *Tesla* lmao
Tesla 1130 calls pussy odte, live by the sword or die by the sword.
Nio is more closer to Tesla than Lucid and Rivian.
Dem Tesla fanboys gonna attack the IRS next
JPMorgan's Yelp page was temporarily disabled after Tesla fans bombarded it with one-star reviews.‚Äî-Yahoo ü§°
I hardly see them anymore lol, feels like they all but left. I remember when 100% of posts here were about gme for months.Then again it comes in waves, like a week ago when it was only tesla here
I was around from the tesla 1k meme days to the original GME days where everyone made fun of DFV.And I can tell you 100% the Tesla and GME play looked a lot more retarded than many of the current ones. It was a brick and mortar game store that no one shopped at that was closing stores like crazy and we were dealing with the early stages of the pandemic quarantine. That play looked like DFV was a moron and GME was going to go bankrupt in days...myet here we are.
As someone who grew up in the 2000s reading popular science and learning about spacex, I was "following" musk since like 2005.    When I later learned about tesla and it was ALSO his company, I was mind blown and totally on board. Then I rode in a tesla for the first time in 2009, when one of the board members of our family company brought it to a board meeting. I was 100% sold. Later found out it was FINALLY going to IPO and I could finally invest....     But back then, investing was a totally foreign, complicated, and confusing process. You needed to sign so many forms just to start an account and pay like $20 to make 1 trade... when I didn't even know what I was doing.      Even with $10,000 graduation money in 2010, and WANTING to Invest in tesla, looking back it makes me borderline suicidal to know I let $20 commission fees intimidate me enough to not invest...
$nkla \`s CEO was LITERALLY shit talking Tesla  before Nikola got caught with the fake truck rolling downhill.&amp#x200BI am surprised he got off with what he did, should of been given a little jail time for intentionally fooling investors.
Tesla has sold at least one car in its lifetime though
lol i just saw my tesla call lose 70%
Tesla calls? Got it.
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve got 20% portfolio in dividend stocks. Let‚Äôs assume they‚Äôre steady stocks, or grow 2% a year. And also give you a dividend, which is mainly why you invested in them. That dividend provides you with whatever amount of money. That‚Äôs good on paper. However, there are stronger investments you can make that have a larger return on investment, without a dividend. For the sake of extreme examples, pretty much any big tech stock this year. Tesla. AMD. Nvidia. Dividend stocks are attractive to retired investors as they typically select the stable dividend stocks, so little risk of loss, and pocket the dividend as extra cash.
This is what I keep telling my friends. Anything not Tesla and I do the opposite what she does and I‚Äôm up huge.
There won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúnext Tesla‚Äù in the EV space.  RIVN is just a case of FOMO
I'm fully aware, but when the shitty half of a sector sells off, the good half does too. As far as I can tell, the only sector that is THAT ridiculously hyped right now is the EV market. I'd like examples of other things that are bad, but that's all that sticks out to me right now.Yes, rising interest rates are going to kill growth stocks in general, and some of those companies are big parts of SPX. Companies that are relying on that easy money for survival are going to have a hard time, some might go under. It's still not even CLOSE to a dot-com situation. I'd agree that Tesla is FOR SURE the poster child of a dot-com-esque company in 2021. but honestly even the extreme example of Tesla isn't even that bad. Despite the insane valuation, Tesla is a profitable company. A ridiculous number of companies in dot-com era were non-profitable on low revenue, with no pathway to viability EVER.Yahoo (one of the companies that actually SURVIVED), peaked at a valuation of $140 billion. The previous year they reported net earnings of $50 million on $200 million in revenue. That's a P/E of 2800. Tesla right now is sitting at a P/E in the 300s.Many of the companies in the Dotcom era were in SUBSTANTIALLY worse shape than Yahoo, and they were absolutely everywhere. Pets .com literally spent 20x their revenue on advertising. 90% of an entire sector was legitimately worthless. That's why Microsoft, Amazon, Cisco, etc sold off so hard. Not because they weren't viable businesses, but because they'd ridden the ride up as a secondary member of the Dotcom companies. Amazon actually makes money, and the reason their earnings aren't higher rn is largely because of Capex. If the shitty EV companies go under as a result of high interest rates or whatever, it's not like electric cars won't get made. GM, Ford, etc will be able to make them, preserving much of the utility of the companies that provide materials and infrastructure for the overvalued EV companies to operate.I'm not saying that everything in the market is fine or that interest rates aren't going to hurt some sectors pretty hard, but I think the post I originally replied to DRASTICALLY overstated companies' current valuations vs the Dotcom bubble. And remember, Yahoo was the google of the era, trading at a PE of 2800. Google, the google of our era, is trading at a PE of 28.I hope this provides some perspective.
The dot-com bubble wasn't just dot-coms.  Cisco had a PE over 100 just like NVidia does today since it was "the building blocks of the internet".  Intel hit their all-time high then and still haven't surpassed it.  AOL and Yahoo! were Google and Facebook of back then.  Microsoft was ... well, Microsoft back then.  And all those companies were extremely profitable, but traded at ridiculous multiples just like today.  Amazon PE over 70 and Tesla over 300 is dot-com-esque.
Nah, that's the part of the movie where our hero finally gets the amount to cover his dept, borrowed from friends and family - and spends it in an attempt to short Tesla
The next Ford? A highly successful automobile company that has been around for 120 years making a vehicle that is the number 1 selling vehicle in the world for a good chunk of that? A company that after 120 years is in the process of pivoting away from their bread and butter technology to embrace the future, and is showing signs of success in doing so? Yeah I'd rather be the next Ford than the next Tesla.
Hold Tesla call yesterday through today was not the play
She made one right bet(Tesla) and people think she's some prolific investor. Gimmeabreak! Compare ARKK to TSLA 5 year charts and tell me I'm wrong.
They have average, classically trained engineers designing the batteries. There's no mentally ill genius at the helm, and their battery life doesn't meet the expectations of Amazon's investment purposes as a direct result. They don't have anyone clever, so every engineering issue has to be fed through a desk of pencil pushers. The eval they got was for being what Tesla is not, and that's true...they are not Tesla. There isn't any quick, clever solutions to the hurdles they face. To make money off the stock is going to take a long time because they have normal, sane people engineering their vehicles.
Cathie getting back in to baba... ark will be gone in 2 yrs. Only thing that's saving her is tesla.
I think many of these companies won‚Äôt be the next Ford or Hyundai etc., they are just going to be absorbed by them. The OEMs have come to the realization after Tesla beat their cheeks, and they are at maximal effort to catch up.
So,  Rivian has actually sold and delivered 150+ trucks as of late October.  And for the Amazon contract, Amazon both owns a 20%stake and has an order for 10,000 vans in 2022 with the option to extend that to a total of 100,000 vans total by 2025. And they are planning on producing the truck, the van,  and the suv by the end of the year. So for your comments about "not selling a single truck" and "if Amazon buys them vans" there ya go. However,  I still agree that the valuation is super dumb,  but I think that about tesla to.
I'm still so bitter. Would be a millionaire on tesla shares if I didn't listen to "smart money" over the last decade.
I think it's crazy. Even if RIVN somehow manages to pull some revenues, it's going to have suppar returns, simply because its started its journey with such a high valuation. If it had opened trading at a fairer valuation of something under $10 billion, I wouldn't scratch my head too hard, but at $100 billion market cap, Tesla was still pulling yearly revenues of $25 billion
it's an overcorrection my friend same with Lucid. you have to understand the "smart money" shitted on Tesla for like 8 years before it broke out and now these guys don't want to miss the "next" ride up so they think everyone is the "next tesla". It's funny how mainstream media still shits all over Tesla but when they wanna promote a new company they're the "next tesla"
I held Tesla and I‚Äôm still fat.
Only a few Tesla dealers have superchargers.Most of them are just AC chargers, 40-80A max
Man you‚Äôd‚Äôve been in great shape if you had held that Tesla like he told you.
&gt considering they have a giant charging networkDo they, or is it just larger than the rest? Tesla just got a head start on the USA while others were slow on the up take. Once production really gets underway Tesla and their proprietary chargers will be left behind. The entire country of the USA and it's 320 million people have fewer electric charging stations than the Netherlands with 17 million people.
The A4 isn‚Äôt an electric car you profound dumbass. Of course Tesla is outselling ICE cars, it‚Äôs the *only* ev right now. You think they are going to outsell every major manufacturer when they have 10 other cars to compete with that cost less?Jesus‚Ä¶ the fanboyism is insane.
It means nothing other than Musk is an amazing manipulator.I think the strike of his options was $6.24. So him 'buying' 2.15MM shares means fuck all in terms indicating his conviction for Tesla.Plebs will read this is as "Musk paid tax and even bought back shares, what a fucking legend!".
Good thing Reddit is not a real place and I don‚Äôt give a fuck what masses think , I was warning against piling into ark after such a huge run up in AUM and Tesla explosion in like January / February , every hot manager in history had it happen to them since like 50s
Sorry Dude it's Tesla bros who are the new boomers.
Lots of my friends love their teslas. Nothing wrong with that if you don't mind the sticker price. If I were to own a car again, I'd most likely buy a used Camry or Corolla due to expected maintenance costs/yr as well as value retained by the vehicle yr by yr. My car is to get me/friends/family from a to b. I don't care what it runs on. I don't care if it's sexy. Just safety, space, and affordability. I personally wouldn't be buying a Ford or GM product unless I am buying new... and plan to buy new every 5-7 years. Because that's about the wall were American vehicles hit where maintenance costs can possibly skyrocket. Tesla should expectedly have low maintenance costs due to being an EV. No fluids to maintain. No exhaust system etc. However getting real data on Tesla maintenance is nigh impossible (no reporting from dealships). Although what is know is their poor performance in reliability which of they were to be ranked... Would put them basically in the  bottom 3 (but hey people still buy BMWs so who cares). What I can say is that 2 of 4 of my friends who own teslas have already eclipsed 3k in auto costs in under 4 years of ownership.  So it's not exactly inspiring to me but like Tesla my sample size is woefully low compared to proven averages that typically puts Asian OEMs ahead in the long run.
This is a Ford dealership though.  Tesla service centers all have Tesla superchargers in the back, they charge up a customers car complimentary while it's in service.  They rotate cars in and out of the chargers all the time, it wouldn't be possible if they had L2 chargers and it took 5-6 hours per vehicle.  If Ford is seriously intending to make a dent in the EV market, they would supply all of the dealership owners with L3 chargers, since many people take their vehicles to the dealership for service.
&gtMUSK SELLS MORE TESLA SHARES DISCLOSED IN FORM 4 FILING $TSLA^FXHedge ^[@Fxhedgers](http://twitter.com/Fxhedgers) ^at ^2021-11-23 ^21:49:10 ^EST-0500
Ford has no reason to build a rapid charger network, because several already exist. There are plenty of fast chargers out there Ford owners can use. If I owned a Ford, I'd have access to 3 rapid charging networks in my small-ish Oklahoma town. If I owned a Tesla I'd have access to the exact same 3 chargers. Besides, Level 2 chargers have a very valid use case, like the one in the picture. Level 2 chargers allow businesses to rather inexpensively allow people to charge their car while at work. For example, level 2 can charge a Mach E in 8-10 hours from almost empty to 100% at a fraction of the cost of a level 3.Level 2 chargers cost about $1000-$2000, including installation. This would likely be somewhat higher in a parking lot due to having to run cables, but let's run with this estimate. Level 3 chargers' *parts* start at $20,000-$50,000 plus labor. If I were a business owner, I'd much rather have 30-50 level 2 chargers than one level 1 charger.
Tesla is the only EV manufacturer with its own proprietary plug. Every single other EV manufacturer and even most manufacturers who haven't made an EV yet have agreed on one standard plug.
I have combed the comment history and can confirm, they have been pumping Tesla for a while.
The patents are worthless to any other automaker. The only thing thing worth ripping off is the battery. Nothing worth stealing or incorporating from a design perspective because they are neither as efficient or unique when compared ford or gm (other than being an EV). Source: myself an engineer who also tore apart a Tesla among other brands. I sat in a lecture once with one of their carbon fiber guys talking about how they improved the curing time of their carbon fiber hoods from 3 hrs to 1.5hrs. that's a 100% efficiency gain. Nevermind, we could stamp 60 hoods a minute out of steel or aluminum. Aluminum is already plenty good enough in weight savings for Non strength critical applications. For strength critical, I'd say ideally steel just because there are certain grades of steel with very high specific strength (strength per weight), that allows you to support more with less.My point is, Tesla does and can make good cars, but compared to big auto players... They aren't there in refinement. $ per $ spent it's not close. And I'm sure there's going to be some people saying that big auto hasn't done shit for EVs and that's not true. They are playing a wait and see approach and keeping profits up until the technology is actually ready before investing  billions in manufacturing and designing. The flip will happen once EVs are ready and honestly unlike the iphone, I sincerely doubt there's going to be any reward for being first to market for when EVs are really consumer ready.
Same. I own a Tesla but the F150 looks so fucking cool and once the truck crowd realize what a powerhouse it is I see sales being explosive.
They will also start selling in China next year and are already present in Hong Kong.The only EV company with Tesla that will be present in all major markets (EU, USA and China) next year Let's fucking go üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Is anyone (more specifically the bigger car companies) actually using Tesla parents?&gtAccording to Tesla, a party is acting in ‚Äògood faith‚Äô so long as the party (and anyone related/affiliated/associated) has not:&gtasserted, helped to assert, or financially backed an assertion of (i) any intellectual property right against Tesla, or (ii) any patent right against a third party for the use of its technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment challenged, helped to challenge, or financially backed a challenge to any Tesla patent marketed or sold any knock-off Tesla product or helped another party to do so.&gtSo, essentially, Tesla‚Äôs patents are only free to use if: you do not enforce any right against Tesla, you do not enforce any patent right against another party, you do not oppose Tesla‚Äôs patents or copy Tesla‚Äôs designs.https://www.vennershipley.co.uk/insights-events/does-teslas-open-source-patent-philosophy-mean-they-are-free-to-use/I feel like any of the bigger companies would have a lot more to "lose" if they did take upon Elon's offer.
Honestly if Ford copies a Tesla car and releases something that looks exactly like the Model 3, I‚Äôll buy a more reliable Ford copy than an original Tesla. A friend of mine has a Tesla and tho I normally love minimalism, they disguise cheapness as ‚Äúminimalism‚Äù and a lack of features
Polestar is the leading GLOBAL producer of electric vehicles, second only to Tesla. They are already delivering vehicles (30K units this year alone), generating revenue, and scaling for production. This will give Tesla a run for its money. The Polestar is also sexy. Plain and simple.Going all in, tomorrow üëç‚ö°
I‚Äôm retarded and bullish on Tesla too but comparing to Ford? Not even their business but the stock chart?? How did you even manage to post this lmao
People doubted tesla in the beginning and said EV would never work gas cars will stay forever outshine the EV market no-one would ever buy a EV and now look at it? It's booming business This is part of the growing pains of a newer company give it time they are gonna have 4 other cars soon I'm sure they will sell very well people will buy these cars cuz most people are impatient and won't wait  a year for a tesla lol
Brother, they are copying Tesla so hard it‚Äôs not funny. Ford is a Dinosaur trying to compete with an asteroid.
Comparing Tesla with Ford ... How fucking retarded are you ?
I completely agree with the intent of what you‚Äôre saying.  A similar design aesthetic helps with people getting used to the stations and what not.  However,  this is still funny to see.  Ford copied the aesthetic without realizing Tesla went with this design style for a practical reason.  Tesla‚Äôs holder for the plug is inside that hole to help shield it from the elements.  Ford has their‚Äôs outside in a holder.
Elon gonna announce a solar powered ev Mars rover, now available on Earth and TSLA will fly to stratosphere.If burry can't afford to bet agaisnt Tesla I'm gonna stick to riding the Cohen
In what sense? You Tesla fanboys look for any opportunity to slander anything that isn‚Äôt Tesla related, grow up.
Really like this company and it‚Äôs the only global EV play other than Tesla right now. Fair price is $40 imo.
Tesla hhhhhhhhhhhh what the fuck üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Tesla calls were NOT the play. Rip portfolio
Fuck u Tesla
I drive stick and own a Tesla. I used to think like you.  I changed my mind the first time I drove a Tesla. The instant torque you get with Teslas is much more fun and faster than shifting gears.
Elon Musk knows how to play the system. Elon said that he planned on executing his stock options about a year ago, yet he still found a way to turn it into a publicity stunt to keep eyeballs on Tesla.
That‚Äôs rough.  The beauty of it for Tesla is that it is also non-transferable so if you buy a new Tesla, you would have to pay for FSD again if you wanted it.
You are not comparing apples to apples here. Tesla FSD and nvidia chips are not the same product. There are exactly 0 cars with Nvidia FSD.Rather than FSD, nvidia chips are used for standard upgrades to vehicles. For example, my Honda fit has lane keeping and adaptive cruise control. Those features cost me between $1000-2000. On a tesla, those features come standard. So you could say that 100% of tesla users buy that tech, and less than 100% buy it for honda (If I remember correctly, the base model didnt even have the option when I bought my car).Comparing FSD (which is doesnt have a great definition for comparison) to all forms of sensors is not a great comparison. It is really easy to detect the large metal car directly in front of you moving at appoximately the same speed, but it is a huge step to detecting a crosswalk 2 miles ahead or a one way sign for full self-driving.
Reminds me of when Biden invited US automakers over to discuss EV cars and Tesla famously got snubbed all because Tesla doesn't have Unions.
I think it's hilarious there are people dumb enough to pay for something that doesn't exist. The Tesla hype really gets into people's heads
To be fair, the clause is plainly meant to refer to real tender offers, not Elon's conversation with the Saudis.  This lawsuit just puts Tesla in the difficult position of framing "funding secured" as legitimate enough to not constitute securities fraud, but not legitimate enough to constitute a tender offer.
tfw you didn‚Äôt buy Tesla at $600 because you thought the memes weren‚Äôt strong enough ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Suspect NHSTA investigations will eventually change that.  They are looking beyond autopilot now.  Waymo have shown you can cover 99.9% of eventualities, but the final 0.1%  is difficult and that's a hug hole in the billions of driver miles driven.  Tesla seems to be struggling to cover even 95% with some of its recent releases.But this article more about the stark reality of Tesla tech versus the competition.
It does seem Tesla customers are far more informed on the reality of Tesla tech than investors...
Screw JPM. But actually, it's called "mitigating damages". If JPM didn't buy the shares in the $700s but instead say at $1100 their damages would be higher, and the judge would say "why didn't you buy shares at $700 to limit your loss when you knew Tesla wasn't complying with your self-imposed new warrant price?"
Can‚Äôt believe I got another chance to short tesla at 1200.
Its not like tesla didn‚Äôt agree to it. This is a two way street and not a unilateral contract. You dont think musk did this on purpose to fuck jpm?
TESLA isn‚Äôt just a car company, it also has a website
They‚Äôre arguing about the legitimacy of JP Morgan‚Äôs adjusted volatility assessment in stock derivatives. JP Morgan says Elon, you tweeted a merger announcement. Tesla says it doesn‚Äôt constitute a merger announcement necessarily and even if it did it was an illegal adjustment.The difference is $162m. Normally banks would probably fuck off to maintain their partnership but Jamie Dimon thinks it‚Äôs worth souring their relationship over.Who will win? JP Morgan of course because nobody is ever out-maneuvering the major Wall Street banks when it comes to a legal battle over pricing models. What will happen? Tesla will settle for less. And then I will make a post about this comment.
Never bet against Tesla. Just ask Burry. üòÇ
I am saying it like it is but the fact that JPM went and purchase them in the open market and try to pass the bill to tesla via court after the fact might cost them a bit. Judge dont like this shit.
Excellent write-up. Tldr, Elon tweeted something about going private at $420 (a joke), and JP Morgan used that to exercise a clause in its contract to unilaterally adjust the price in its favor. When Tesla confirmed that it was a joke a couple weeks later, JP Morgan adjusted the price back a little bit, but not all the way back to the original value, so that they could make some $130M extra from the original contract.Tesla disagreed, and said that since it was just a stoner/pothead joke, the price should never have changed in the first place, or should have been adjusted back the the original value when JP realized it was just a joke.JP is leaning hard on the Twitter account angle though, saying Elon's Twitter account is, by Tesla's own words years ago, an official company announcement platform.My opinion... it was obviously a joke, JP needs to quit being dicks about it. No one can really make the argument that Elon's Twitter account is 100% Tesla's official announcements, just like no one can say Trump's deleted Twitter account was official US policy.
According to the actual legal complaint.&gtThe warrants did expire with Tesla's share price above that strike price... Tesla has flagrantly ignored its clear contractual obligation to pay JPMorgan in full.
For sure.....Like Apple....Tesla......But for medicine!
&gt That is textbook fraud.And he paid a fine.This is something else -- JPM changed the price on the warrants a second time after it was clear they weren't going private.  They changed it to a price advantageous to themselves, not their originally agreed upon price.  Tesla paid them the price they agreed to, not the one that JPM pulled out of their ass later.  JPM can go pound sand.
Every tesla lawyer loses one year off their life when musk has his Reddit moments
I mean all his other ventures are private. Can you imagine the valuation SpaceX would have if it was public? Would even be crazier than Tesla. Rumors that he is even on the board of companies sends the stock price skyrocketing
No, Tesla literally won't sell them shares according to a contractual agreement. (Or so JPM says)
Tesla model N incoming.
Lol. The gullibility of you cultists never ceases to amaze me. America is majorly fucked because of the built in car dependent sprawl. It‚Äôs unsustainable drawn out bankruptcy. Welcome to urban planning within the past two decades. And that solar company? Is that the one that was damn near bankrupt he had to court fraud on his investors so that Tesla would buy solar city?
I heard if you put your options under your pillow at night, Daddy Musk will give you a tesla.
Ding ding ding! I hope this goes to court just so they can get chats and texts from Tesla during discovery, and whatever wildly unprofessional stuff Musk is sending around becomes public record. There has to be some gold in there.
Hell, 80% of the safety features are built into the skateboard, so probably!  Just take the top off your Tesla and put it on the Canoo skateboard.
Can I get a canoo that looks like a Tesla or lucid?
SpaceX he did indeed start himself. Tesla he joined as a co-founder (legally correct). Yet Tesla wasn't shit before he joined, and he can easily be attributed as the person who made it what it is. Every other founder either left, was made to step down, or took on a minor role.So it is not at all correct to say he bought into companies getting shit done. None of them were getting shit done before he either created them or joined.
Agreed!!! The Tesla of Biotech. YOLO from my camp. Going to be life changing for me and society!
Found the guy who tried to short Tesla
Interesting to note that one of INOVIO's Scientific Board Members is Dr. Stanley A. Plotkin who invented the Rubella Vaccine......This man is a Nobel Prize winning caliber M.D......Prestige company.....Like the Tesla of biotech's

Ford have a new EV truck coming up as we know. Deliveries start in February The F-150!!! The highest selling automobile in the US for the last 40 years consecutively. 160k preorders. Not including fleet orders.If this thing is good, then they are selling more EVs trucks than Rivian. And, that‚Äôs just one model. Not to mention the ev maverick, the EV transit, the EV mustang, etc. Ford will be selling 600k EVs a year in about 2 years, based on my research. They may be the 2nd biggest EV producer (VW and BYD will run them close as will GEELY). Tesla MC = 1.2TFord MC = 85BTesla revenue = 31.5BFord revenue = 127BAmericans love a brand.Ohhh, and they‚Äôre profitable. Ohhh, ohhhh, and they own 12% of Rivian (12B), ohhh and they pay Divs‚Ä¶The futures bright. The futures F.
I agree, seems like the real defense to this was ‚Äúsorry, I was high‚Äù isn‚Äôt a great one to use, so he went with ‚Äúthe Saudis would have paid!‚ÄùBut I also think Tesla has a good faith argument against the adjustment handling by JPM, as not clear you can just take the implied vol change for the period and adjust by that But end of the day, you need to actually engage in that conversation, but seems Tesla is just ignoring it
This is a really good breakdown of the dispute: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-16/jpmorgan-fights-tesla-over-warrants](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-16/jpmorgan-fights-tesla-over-warrants) It's behind a paywall for some reason (I highly recommend Matt Levine's email newsletter, which has the same content and is free), but for the time being you can just disable JS to view.
yo elon if ya reading, id really appreciate 1 tesla. I'll even settle for model 3
This is infuriatingly stupid...Nobody in their right mind thinks Tesla is worth a trillion...
We got around that in NM by having the Tesla outlets on tribal land.
this is why TSLA has the valuation that it does.  Elon inspires a cult-like following.  You're not investing in Tesla. You're investing in Elon.
Tesla 1300 EOW and y‚Äôall sleeping on it
They didn‚Äôt like it when he tweeted that he was considering making Tesla private.
It's an amazing company with zero revenue which means it's better than tesla!
90% of that 87k came from flipping Tesla weeklies :D  Great volume, and highly predictable movement.
Tesla to $5T market evaluation üòÇüòÇüòÇ
QQQ was overbought, Tesla blew past 1200 but didn't consolidate, and also the last minute lawsuit from JPM all had a role in this play.After that, QQQ started trending down while Tesla was doing its own thing. Options premiums were much lower than I had expected making this a great risk/reward pay.Initially I was planning on holding this for 30 minutes regardless of the result, most likely making a 20-30% quick swing. However, the dump finally came and triggered a bunch of stop orders, giving me 5x my expected returns.Tesla moves up and down very quickly, both support and resistance levels are a LOT weaker relative to other stocks.
Yeah dude, Apple is just Tesla now but with actual revenue. Apple to 3 Trillion EOW
Schr√∂dinger's Tesla
Dealerships are such a sham. Tesla tried to sell direct to customers here in Ohio. The dealership association has power. Basically told them no you can't sell cars that way. These rich families that own the dealership don't want to give up easy money.
Pro tip: never short Tesla End of presentation
I have a feeling the more people that think Tesla will go into the shitter the higher the stock goes so üíéüôå
Tesla to 10,000$
&gtBy which time VW and the like will be selling 9  or 10 million EV'sHAHAHAHAHAVW's planning on having \~200GWh of installed capacity by 2030. At \~75kwh per car that's still ONLY 2.6M units. Tesla at least will have passed that by 2023.  And that's why people are LONG on Tesla.
god i literally can‚Äôt wait for the tesla bubble to pop. the longer it stays up here the harder it falls. i actually don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a more annoying type of person than the elon fanboy
I‚Äôm an electrician in the UK, and have been flat out installing Tesla chargers in peoples homes for the last 2 years
It's stupid. Does Kevin O'Leary actually do or recommend this?Capital gains compound the same way dividends do, on a pre-tax basis. Since being paid a dividend reduces the value of the share by dividend amount (yes, this happens every time, no, it won't show up as a "-xx%" and that's why people don't notice it, the stock price is adjusted rather than being counted as a decrease on the ex-div date), it's identical to capital gains on a pre tax basis. Example: company with a price of $10 per share increases its value by $1 per share. Say you own one share. If the company keeps money you own 1 share worth $11 per share. If it pays that as a dividend and you reinvest, you own 1.1 shares worth $10 per share. That's before you get taxed on the dividend. For what it's worth, you'd have to look kinda hard to find an ETF that doesn't pay a dividend, or doesn't hold any dividend paying companies. Also, if you have exceptions to your rule like Tesla... You kinda don't have a rule. Here's something better: total market index funds. VTI and VXUS.
Since the Model 3 and the change to NMC chemistry, Tesla has designed battery cells to retain 90% capacity after 500 000 miles. Even if we compound the probability of failure per cell to a whole pack, there's absolutely no indication that batteries will need to systematically be replaced before the rest of the car gives in. 500 000 miles is almost 42 years based on US average distance per year.Even older vehicles (Model S / Model X) usually show 10 to 15% degradation after 200 000 miles, with significant tapering after the initial drop. It is important to note that even if systematic, changing the battery for those would involve thousands of cars, not millions, since Tesla's production was much smaller back then.I think you can argue that *some* vehicles are seeing a steep degradation curve, and some more than others, but it is absolutely *not* widespread.
If a gas engine breaks down after 10-15 years and the car goes to the junkyard it‚Äôs not going to rock a car company‚Äôs stock.An electric engine will still be in good shape after 10 years, but the battery pack will need to be replaced at a cost of $14,000+It still a few years off, but when millions of Tesla customers are hit with high cost of battery replacement to keep their cars moving this will be a big problem. Granted it‚Äôs still cheaper than buying gas for 10 years, but no one will see it that way.
If Fisker is worth 8B and Lucid is worth 90B, then this little beast of a company has to be worth at least 100B.  Fisker is garbage and no one can afford a Lucid (plus they want badly to be Tesla and they never will be). All in on the company redesigning the vehicle and making it affordable for the regular chumps.
That conspiracy theory about the Tesla stock split seems pretty convincing ngl
If y‚Äôall believe in the 12/9 Tesla split conspiracy like me üòÇüíÄ join the leap $2100c gang. 2100/5=420.
The whole EV industry very much overvalued (including Tesla).   Does not mean it is smart to go short as a bubble can continue to grow much bigger for a long time before it start deflating.
TESLA, ATH this week!!!!
Please baby Jesus make Tesla split again.
Go back 5-10 years... substitute Lucid with Tesla. I mean, who TF wants to buy an unproven American made electric car for 6 figures?  Go green? Get a Prius.  Want brand name?  Get an BMW, Lexus, etc.  Tesla will be a bust....
No dude, I heard Tesla and AMC are partnering up to show all movies in Tesla‚Äôs. Also, Amazon will be delivering iPads that are sponsored by AMC. So, Tesla, Amazon, and Apple are all partnering with AMC.
Nvidia is the new Tesla
1. We buy tsla puts.2. someone steals elons phone and tweets dumb shit3. tesla stock go down
Even if Tesla has a massively overvalued stock, that bubble bursting won't tank the world economy.   Evergrande is a threat because it has several small country GDPs' worth of unpayable debt due to its gigantic buildings being completely empty. It'd be like if it turned out Tesla was just churning out millions of cars without actually selling any.
There are also dozens of pro tesla posts with the crazy conspiracy elon god guy taking it furthest.
I think it‚Äôs severe FOMO amongst everyone because a lot of people didn‚Äôt invest in Tesla, doubted it and didn‚Äôt believe in it and now they‚Äôre doing really good, so my guess is they think it‚Äôll be the next tesla and they‚Äôll absolutely print
Target market is middle age, mid to upper class but not ultra rich. Like doctors, dentists, c-suite small companies.   People that value comfort and qualityI think they'll try to switch to more affordable versions down the road but this is high margin, low volume. Perfect for a start up. It's what Tesla did with the Roadster...
Lets be real tesla is the definition of ‚Äú you can‚Äôt time the market‚Äù.Tesla could announce they will stop making cars but still go up because elon tweeted the poop emoticon.
Tesla already has the existing battery supply chain on lockdown. This is the same thing apple has done with their supply chain with iPhones in the past. The situation is that Tesla has said to their suppliers that they will buy every battery they make as long as it‚Äôs a reasonable price, everyone else gets whatever is leftover or whatever is more expensive, or pouch cells. It‚Äôs important to remember that Tesla has been working on their battery supply chain for over a decade and started building their own battery factory around 2013 and is currently ramping up production of more in house battery supply. All the other EV manufacturers are just getting to where Tesla was in 2013 when it comes to battery supply chain. If suppliers had enough batteries to make 600,000 more cars by 2023, then they are either going to Tesla or they are batteries Tesla isn‚Äôt interested in. At this point Tesla is a reliable battery customer so it makes sense to prioritize their business, especially when other manufacturers pull this on you.

&gtI'm forced to buy tsla pre-split.    Is this a bad thing? Shit I wanna take out a loan with my wife's bf, and max my margin to buy tesla on 12/8.
My grandma hates gambling cause my aunt is a serious slot machine addict. She thinks it great that I‚Äôm ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù in the stock market. I don‚Äôt have heart to tell her about 0dte Tesla options
‚ÄúTesla sold too many cars‚Äù is my new favorite bear thesis
Yeah Tesla is basically an entertainment stock for me. Too rich to play with but puts on a good show
Well, I know a lot of people in my community (south Asians) are waiting for lucid. They want an ev that looks nice. They want an ev that‚Äôs not an everyday brand like merc. It‚Äôs very anecdotal I know but lucid does seem to have people looking at it here in the north east.Personally while Tesla (stock) has been so good to me I don‚Äôt like how Tesla‚Äôs look (except roadster).
Based on what exactly? Your over simplifying,  and making assumptions that Tesla buyers are somehow all Tesla fanboys. One look at Porsche or Audi electric vehicle orders. And the large percentage of them who are jumping ship from Tesla.  Is a very clear signal of whats happening in the luxury EV market. Anf it was inevitable. Musks spartan interiors were a cost saving gimmick by an automaker struggling to turn profits.  The minute there are true luxury vehicles on the market. With world class interiors.  Comparable to other 6 figure cars. Tesla owners will jump ship quickly. And already have been. Even if you ignore the obvious trend shift thats happening. The wait list for a Tesla alone, will drive buyers to other options. I own F shares. I have no intention of ever purchasing a Ford.
Most people who buy LCID shares are the ones who missed out on Tesla due to fomo. Trust me, most of them who made money off of lucid are buying a telsa with their money and not a lucid.
Your logic was pretty sound up until this. Tesla fanboys have this odd habit of assuming everyone else is too. It's just weird.
Same demographic as Tesla.
Seems like any post that trashes Tesla is getting every award under the Sun right now.
Demand plays part of a roll too. Tesla wasn‚Äôt offering any discounts to a huge rental car company Tesla purchase agreement because ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt NEED this deal‚Äù.
I‚Äôve been saying this for the past few weeks!! A split would give people an opportunity to invest in Tesla. Definitely see this happening within the next few months.
So PE dropped by the factor of 4. Factor of 20 (at least) to go... sounds reasonable. One thing to grow auto production by 50% from a million (500K increase in a year). Another is 50% increase from 5M (additional 2.5M capacity just in a year). Good luckEdit: also glad to hear that you are okay waiting 5-10 years at the same price to let Tesla catch up its valuation. So that then you can enjoy your annual 5% growth
Literal books have been written lmao. Tesla fanboys are a different breed.
I have a model x, so not sure about model 3 or y, but to unlock the car using the phone, you need to be logged in on the phone app, which does require Tesla server, and when Tesla server last went down, the app also logged me out. If I didn‚Äôt have the physical keys, I can totally see myself not being able to get in.
Also many companies are capitalizing on the situation raising prices blaming inflation to take larger profits. For instance Tesla increased the price of its Model Y by 20%+
How do we know it‚Äôs even related to Tesla? Could it be SpaceX going public?
Amazon was not a member of SPX at the time of the dotcom bust. Tesla is. Tesla dropping 70% will drag the entire index down and cause margin calls. Fuck, the GME spike from January caused a drop in SPX. It was temporary because the problem was short-term, but NQ took like 13 years to recover its previous ATH after the bubble blew up. You're right that things will come back, the question is how long will it take?
It has to be bots, someone post about Tesla and EV stocks being over valued daily...
nobody dares to short tesla anymore and that is a huge problem
This is the classic guy that has made ‚Äú100x‚Äù on TSLA but will complain about banks being greedy when the time comes that everyone realizes that Cathie Wood and everyone else that thought ‚Äútech‚Äù was unlimited when talking about a car company that is valued more than the entire car market of the whole world combined and then some. I don‚Äôt wish bad upon you man, I really don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just so tired of seeing this and knowing that inevitably they will blame retail consumers (which have a part but are not the major money movers ((makers)) in the market) because people say ‚ÄúhAhA iF yOu WaNt To LoSe MoNeY bEt AgAiNsT tEsLa.‚Äù One day this won‚Äôt be true and not by a long shot. You may think you‚Äôll get out early but you won‚Äôt and you‚Äôll be the same person that complains about ‚Äúhedge funds‚Äù and ‚Äúbanks‚Äù when you were just as a part of the greed as they were. I‚Äôm posting this because I‚Äôm drunk and annoyed with the unbelievable echo chamber that exists here and everywhere else. Retail traders will get murdered when this market crashes and I don‚Äôt know when and I‚Äôm not Michael Burry so I won‚Äôt lie to you. I know it will though and I know all of you people invested in a company that hasn‚Äôt sold a car (Rivian) will blame someone else but yourself. This isn‚Äôt 2008. You can‚Äôt blame AIG, JPM, GS or Lehman Bros. It will be your fault. It won‚Äôt be your actual fault, but you‚Äôll give big money a fucking reason to testify in front a congress and say ‚ÄúLook, we just did what everyone else was doing.‚Äù The only difference is they do this for a living and will get out and hedge and help themselves much faster than you know how to.The worst part of this is that I want to come to this sub, and many others, and see you people hurt. That‚Äôs not who I am and I hate that I feel like that. But here it is, I‚Äôve been saying it forever and everyone here not only ignores it but actually threatens me for saying something different from their opinion. It‚Äôs a cautionary tale‚Ä¶I may never be right but I can promise to fucking god there is a reason why big money has participated in all of the shenanigans that exists here. The music will stop and big money will have a chair, retail traders won‚Äôt.
What the actual fuck are you talking about?? There are thousands of articles bashing legacy automakers. But a few critical about Tesla and fanboys go insane.
Cause it is well known fact that the past performance indicates future performance. Since Tesla went up x20 in the last years, surely it should go another x20 in the next few years too. I mean there is definitely more room to grow for an *auto* company worth of 1.1T with PE of 400.
Tesla hits 1500 by eoy due to news about Tesla college program and thousands of Austin citizens start working at the Austin plant, driving up real estate prices even further.  In a few years, elon will start the mars independence war against Earth. All Tesla factories on earth will shut down due to gov. retaliation thus creating mini economic creators in their city and possible neighboring towns     Years after the great Musky war, earth recaptures mars, but they are too late as the majority of mars is mined to the core and Elon musk and his followers have moved on to the next planet
On 12/09 Elon will disrobe his human garb, and reveal his true identity as an alien from a place far far away.  He has been leaving hints about this for many years...Just kidding, I am long Tesla.
The market already has gone full retard regarding Tesla.
Tesla goes up, sometimes.... Most times....I bought 2 11/26 1300 calls at 2.30, didn't sell when they hit 7. Just gonna see what happens
Can't unlock your Tesla with a key?
I agree that Tesla could bring down the market. I saw in the last two weeks the correlation between Tesla and spy. However, after Musk said he was going to sell (which I thought was a great move for a leader), the amount it dropped (not much), and how it recovered. Tesla is not dropping much. As long as Elon is there. If he leaves....total anarchy. It's going to take something else I think, to crash the market. I chose to start a new paragraph instead of a thread, but if anyone sees this and has an opinion, I would love to hear thoughts on the possibility, of no more market crashes, in the future. I feel with what's been done in the recent past (basically propping the market up), plus new investors. Apps, making it possible for everyone to invest easily. The market may not crash (hard) again.
So, tesla 1500c by jan? Got it
Valuations are directly proportionate to % of Elon's, Ford has 0 Elon's, Tesla has infinitely more Elons, therefore Tesla undervalued, Ford overvalued
Except when Facebook crashed you couldn‚Äôt actually use Facebook. The VAST majority of Tesla owners, myself included, could still use our cars.
I am a Tesla owner but Ford does seem to be the smartest long term play at the minute, I went to the LA Autoshow today and saw the F-150 lightning, they will sell a million + of those before Rivian gets anywhere near profitable production and my friends mustang Mach-e despite being crazy ugly has much more reliable software and much higher build quality than my brand new 3 performance.  They are heavily invested in the batteries and 2025 in my view will be great timing
So than ford is actually the most undervalued company in the world. P/E of 27 and it's making EVs that should 15x to get up to Tesla evaluations. Or Tesla is just massively overvalued
Tesla is the fifth biggest component of SPY. Did not know that.
Sell while your ahead. Its going to be years before they even approach  Tesla deliveries numbers or even NIO. Its  a Over inflated Stock. But if your really want to see if goes both ways Sell and leave 25 Percent for the Long Run. Then if u decide can use extra money for future crashes or Puts on Rivian :P
Why are we convinced Rivian is a pump and dump? Wouldn‚Äôt Bezos, who owns 20% of the company, want to compete with Musk and Tesla?
Discounting won‚Äôt give them tax benefits. Rich people donate money to charity run by them, get tax break and then use the money however they feel. They don‚Äôt give a shit what common man is paying for a vehicle. Tesla is great car but it has pushed many people to live beyond their limit and put 60k towards a car. They would have otherwise put 35k or less. And now they are becoming slave to their commitment. Only person benefitting here is our celebrity ceo Mr Musk.
not a waste, but there's a lot of overlap. the S&ampP 500 covers about 80% of a US total-market index. look at the top 10 holdings and it's identical: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, JP Morgan, Faceboook, Nvidia, Tesla, Berkshire, etc. you're doubling up on a lot of stocks. the total market fund has the slightly higher fee because it has a lot more stocks and is more complex to manage. but I'd prefer to use the total market index, because it has more mid-size and small company stocks. there are times smaller companies will dominate and large companies not do so well (like the 1970s and 2000-2012).
Also a Tesla owner here, I always keep one of the keycards in my wallet.Dumb to rely on the phone alone when using the car imo.
Most popular car brand in Norway is Tesla. They have all the European and Korean and Chinese EV brands
That's why I just bought a 1999 Ford expedition...ok fine that's not the only reason I'm a cheap skate as well.  It scares me that 72 month car loans is normal for Tesla owners.  Maybe selling my IRA Tesla shares Friday was the right move.
Fake news. The people tweeting about being locked out are retarded. They give you two keycards when you purchase your tezzy specifically for situations like thisSource: proud tesla owner
I‚Äôm yoloing tesla sometime next week. Done losing in small amounts so it‚Äôs either a lottery or I‚Äôm going to work.
Boomer delimma,Get $400,000 worth of tesla calls insted
I get you feel that way, but most consumers don't care about FSD right now.In fact, most Tesla's that I drive by on the interstate don't even have AP on. Even in traffic. People in general don't trust it. Ford is one of the few automakers taking on Tesla and EVs very seriously which is a pleasant surprise.
Stellar post.....Nice to know that INOVIO has over 200 patents on its medicines and technology.....This is like buying Apple.....Tesla....Regeneron in the first inning.....$200 stock in less than 18 months IMHO
Wait wait wait.He's saying 1.2m Ford BEV.You're saying 3.2m from Tesla. IN 2026?!I bet annualized Tesla Q1 2023 is 3.2m. You heard me, Q1 2023 @ 800k units.

If anything, this news will send Tesla to $1,400. Bitches love electricity.
Crypto is the only investment class where skeptics resort to arguments like "you just want to make money". As if any of you would fall on the sword for one of the tickers in your portfolio or arbitrarily chosen index fund. Bitcoin and maybe Tesla are a few of the only names where some of their investor base actually would.
You forgot that Tesla is immune to bad news
I've scalped Tesla options so many times that I feel like I can sense its candle movements like a horse whisperer - had a 0DTE 1130 that I managed to sell at the very tip of the nip at 1126Who am I kidding, just dumb luck
So Ford thinks EV batteries are going to fall out of the sky.  Do they not know there's a reason Tesla keeps building battery factories
You make it sound like Ford doesn‚Äôt make money selling anything but electric vehicles, that‚Äôs all Tesla offers so obviously that‚Äôs what they sell. They are transitioning, but you and I both know the technology will only improve moving forward. So why not keep selling your trusted ICE vehicles while making the transition? Consumers are buying up the new Bronco and still buy F-150‚Äôs like they always have been. Plus the new Mach-E is actually getting healthy reviews, once the trust is built they will continue to buy EV‚Äôs from Ford. The Lighting is the one I‚Äôm really looking into because I need a truck for work. I‚Äôm not saying Tesla isn‚Äôt a good company, but you can‚Äôt just push the king of the truck market under the rug and pretend it‚Äôs not there.
Yea they also make a shit load of these gas vehicles they still get paid on so why are u comparing to Tesla‚Ä¶. How manygovt fleet contracts does Tesla have vs Ford ‚Ä¶.. lol that will translate to ev soon
Any woman that works in manufacturing is going to be subjected to this. My SO was a manufacturing engineer for a machining company and she was literally harassed on a weekly basis. It was insane but it was sadly the norm.It‚Äôs awful but it is a deep nationwide issue, not just a Tesla problem.
Ford sold 400,843 vehicles last quarter Tesla sold 201,250 vehicles last quarter Ford is clearly shit, you better buy $100,000 in Ford puts and post it here for us. üòä
Tesla is the Tesla of China btw....
It‚Äôs also less than 2/3rds of what Tesla will make in 2021‚Ä¶ most likely with worse company margins per vehicle lol
I means look at Tesla!!!! Lol
Bullish news on Tesla, to 1400 we goooo
Take 5 shares of Lucid and give me 3 shares is Tesla? Then yes. ü§ì retard brain math good
Buffett said if today's interest rate is going to stay as it is, then the stock market is incredibly cheap right now.If you genuinely believe that the Feds won't raise rates, then the best play is hyper growth stocks. How did you think a company like Tesla managed to cross $1T? But I hope I don't need to tell you how reckless this way of investing is.
Lol they keep raising price targets of Tesla wtf.
He thought he‚Äôs buying the ‚ÄòTesla killer‚Äô LOL
I‚Äôm doing well on it, but the $2100-ish worth of Tesla stock I bought would be far more shares and worth a little under $700k if I‚Äôd bought it when I first put it on my watch list.
I've lost about 80k in the past year betting against Tesla. (Opportunity cost) On this very day in 2012 I met two girls in a starbucks, helped them set up a Bitcoin wallet, and sold them 20 bitcoins for a total of $250.
It's only apples to apples if you invested in the same fund. If he invested in Tesla and you in Apple, of course the results would be different in 1 year
Tesla went through lengthy discussions with NHTSA over the Model S steering yoke.I'm not even sure if NHTSA officially approved it. Good luck getting approvals for no steering wheel or pedals.
u/Captain-Whoopass 2 days ago &gt Somewhere out there is a moron who sold chinese stocks at the bottom and bought Tesla and NVDA and US bubbles at the top. God bless them, they are the poster child for this 2021 clown marketü•¥
It's year 2030. Apple, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia make up 97% of SPY and QQQ. Everything else is a penny stock.
What are you talking about? Tesla will have it by 2018
It‚Äôs not street legal. Currently all cars need them even if they have self driving capabilities because of the Tesla scare in 2018
I prefer to use the Tesla one expect Apple to be $25k per share by mid 2023
The problem is going to be producing at scale, just ask Tesla.
Apple has only 120x more software engineers on staff than Tesla.
Tesla the company has a good future ahead of it, I think most people believe.TSLA the stock is an unpredictable beast whose performance is only tenuously tied to the performance of Tesla the company.
The hilarious part was that it was actually option C: Tesla survives its near-bankruptcy, flourishes (at least market cap wise), AND you still don't get a Roaster while watching your deposit turn to peanuts as inflation cucked you.Funding secured.
They have an offering that‚Äôs near completion which is partially keeping the stock down.That said the company is absolutely the best placed to challenge Tesla going forward in the next few years for dominance in China and eventually elsewhere with its disruptive tech (battery swap making getting a full battery take 2 minutes kinda like a gas station vs 40 minutes for a super charger is huge). NIO day in mid December which will likely unveil a few new models and a mass market line is expected too. And expectations of 11k+ deliveries being the standard now also seem great on paperBut it‚Äôs being ignored for now. EV atm seems to like to ignore fundamentals
Considering Tesla is creating their own fleet of semi trucks, and autonomous driving tech, wouldn't Tesla be the next Tesla?
These lucid bag holders are clown as hell, no I ain‚Äôt buying your discount Tesla
I bought AMD at 6$, I bought nvidia at 57$. I bought Tesla at 250$ before the split. I believed in all three companies. But did I hold any of it? You bet your ass I sold it all at like a 15% gain
I started out with $500, I picked Tesla and Microsoft, got to almost 5k, then I picked calls for snap, sq, pltr, wen, and now baba, I have $4 left in my account.Fuck everything
Whatever company starts making a name for itself in this field first will be the next Tesla It's going to be huge in like 10-20 years
Tesla mooning today, bad news = at least 3% today
The year is 2025, economic melt-up has lead to five companies dominating all industries. Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid now account for almost all of the world‚Äôs economic activity. Through aerodynamic innovation Nikola has doubled the speed it can send a truck downhill. Only one non-EV company remains, CRSR, which still costs $25 a share.
Tesla puts are getting fucked üçÜ
Can I too get blown by people shorting Tesla?
Its way too late to buy tesla. Either you are already in Tesla, and playing Billy Big bollocks with Elon Musk. Or you're outside watching this shit go down. The best option in either case is to throw your phone into a very deep well and forget about Tesla.
Maybe Tesla isn‚Äôt overvalued, maybe the other car companies are undervalued ü§ì
A few years back when the Roadster was revealed in Nov 2017, I was on the Tesla Investor sub (have shares from back then still) and there was talk about the $50K deposit they were asking for (it was understood Tesla needed cash back then so they pushed the Roadster reveal so early to get deposits). Someone made a similar comment that you should just put the $50K in the stock and not make a down payment. He explained that either Tesla is successful and will eventually produce the Roadster, in which case the stock will be way up so you can then use that money to pay for it OR Tesla will fail and you won't get your Roadster anyways and you will lose your deposit (so the stock declining won't be worse). If you recall back then the financial situation was dicey. In any case, funny to think back about that and how if someone followed that advice, the $50K would be about $1M today and would more than pay for the Roadster (whenever Tesla finally puts it out).
That's the fun part: we get to redefine value for Burry et al by buying.  Reminding everyone of their Econ 101 lessons day 1 whiteboard.  "The value of X=what someone is willing to pay for X."Tesla is vastly overvalued according to the books we've read about investing.  But the buyers set the value.&gtWhy would someone short this stock?Some people are allergic to money.  I mean, I assume.
People are not wrong about Tesla. They are wrong about federal reserve. Tesla is just a symptom while Fed is the disease. Right now the mother of all bubble is too damn big and I think we are heading the same path as japan in 1980s.
I genuinely believe there's no bubble. Sure Tesla is overpriced and there will be a correction and half the shit stocks will go to zero, but you will never see SPY 450 again and FAANG will just keep growing for the next ten years
Tesla has better margins at 10 years of production than ICE manufacturers have managed  to get to in 100 years
Mary Bear-ah: we‚Äôre going to pass Tesla in EVs in 2025 when we manufacture 1M EVs. Tesla: we‚Äôre going to manufacture close to 2M units in 2022. Retail traders seem to be the only ones pricing in Tesla‚Äôs future.
You do realize that argument has been made since Tesla was 300 pre-split, it was obviously criminally wrong then, and it‚Äôs wrong now.
I‚Äôve been watching people say that same thing since the old Yahoo finance message board days when TSLA was sub $100. Quite a few kids college funds have been blown by people shorting Tesla.
It‚Äôs not:- Profit margin‚Äòs are increasing rapidly- the output per factory is staggeringly higher than anticipated (and increasing)- Tesla‚Äôs EV market share is higher than anticipated And ^ this lead is growing Lucids cool but it‚Äôs guidance is 500k cars in....2030. Rivians main competition is Ford. The rest of the auto industry is gonna belong to Tesla sooner rather than later
i remember my coworker bragging about his new tesla model Y he bought 3 years ago. he dropped $60k on that if i remember. recently i told him half jokingly that he shoulda dropped that money into TSLA stock instead. he just checked the tsla stock price and almost had a heart attack
Let me guess, you‚Äôve been wrong about Tesla consistently for a decade but you definitely know what‚Äôs going to happen next?
Just wait, TSLA is going to crash over the next year as Tesla rolls out:- two new factories that will more than double capacity- high scale production of the 4680 cells- fully release (and recognize revenue) of FSD- the 15-20% price increases already published trickle to delivered vehicles that are sold out for 12 months - release the mother fucking CyberTruck- Biden gifts them $8,000 per vehicle - opens global SuperCharging network and becomes the next Exxon
But the thing is Rivian actually has had zero sales in the 12 years it‚Äôs been alive. It might just be the most overvalued stock in the world. The difference is Tesla has made a revenue in the last 12 years. If anything Ford or Toyota should just buy Rivian
If Tesla is worth what the stock market says it's worth, then Rivians value is real. Rivian has a lot of Tesla's mindshare. A lot of their future growth potential is going to be siphoned away to Rivian.  Their truck and SUV are comparable to Tesla offerings, more aesthetically pleasing to most people, and people like Rivian's politics and hate Elon Musk.  Long term, it's worth at least 20% of whatever Tesla's worth.  Now, if you think the current price is too high, I agree but with the proviso that the same is true of Tesla. Amazing how all the Tesla holders are suddenly all about fundamentals and units shipped.  It's like they're suddenly making all the same arguments at Rivian people have been making at Tesla.and they were laughing at.  It's kinda funny. Disclaimer: I don't hold either.
Bullish, the stonk is super cheap here. PayPal is disrupting banks (as is Square but this isn‚Äôt a Square vs PayPal discussion) and Bernstein the boomers and analyst old farts are focused on the next shit pay laterers disrupting a fraction of PayPal‚Äôs farts. It‚Äôs the same losers who say Tesla is legit threatened by Lucid. Yeah, okay. In fact Bernstein specifically mentions in their downgrade to Hold that Amazon could replace them. They just partnered with PayPal dumdums, the moment the eBay PayPal exclusivity dries up Amazon partners with Venmo and you say Amazon is going to get rid of them? Buying the dips of the dips of the dips any time they dip.
Rivian ded, Lucid ded, Tesla‚Ä¶. Too much retard strength.
Rivian is bubble. Tesla isn‚Äôt. Change my mind.
Waiting for Nvidia to print tomorrow morning so I can afford Tesla calls
I know most of you didnt listen to the NVDA earnings call but holy shit. Theres a VERY good reason it jumped 50% the last month. And theres a very good reason that it will jump more i think. Omniverse- basically their goal is that all internet in the future will touch a GPU that they make. They simulate everything. Someone taking your order in the drivethru? Omniverse avatar. Self driving cars? Omniverse avatar. Simulating your manufacturing plant? Omniverse avatar. I think they use avatar for any simulation of a single entity. Its an AI and robotics platform. They now have 25,000 companies subscribing to it. (Side note- goodbye BB lol). They want/ have been creating/have achieved full stack. As in, they make the chips. They make the servers. They make the software. You just subscribe. At $1,000 per year with an expected 100million customers. Remember, every car that drives itself is a customer. $1,000 per year. They‚Äôre modeling entire cities on this platform. To be honest, it was a bit above my head because I haven‚Äôt kept up on everything they‚Äôve done. I gotta research more so i know what Im talking about. But apparently they‚Äôve been working toward this for 5 years and have finally achieved it. This doesnt just cut into Intel CPU servers in terms of market share. It cuts into Amazon AWS. It pulls new clients from the design, research, and developer fields. Its just way bigger than I thought. And they say their chip shortage will end in 6 months or less. I think for the next 5 years every paycheck I get will go toward buying more shares and Calls on every dip. I see this at $500 by mid 2022. And thats not even putting it in a bubble like Tesla is, based on their self driving car. Fuck why is my dick so hard.
This or next decade. Depends if ion trapping is best approach or could go to nothing. Or maybe it pumps but does so before they reach major milestones like Tesla.It's not just IONQ who are betting big on QC, Google, Honeywell, IBM, Intel, Rigetti and some non-public companies D-wave, PsiQuantum, Xandu are all big players. Chinese companies as well. High risk, high reward. Remember to do your DD.
Right.  Basically: what thing that everyone owns separately might get consolidated and used/sold from a single source that can be monetized?We're seeing it in cloud computing, SaaS, streaming music/video services, online gaming, ecommerce.  This is where someone like Cathy Wood would chime in about robotaxis and no one needing to own their own cars anymore, so Tesla is worth 10 quadrillion dollars.But what if you could get medical examinations, diagnoses, and prescriptions not from millions of individual doctors but from a few online medical sites that used a combo of AI and real doctors to diagnose you?  Similarly veterinarians.  Or education.What if your computer or phone was just mostly a dumb terminal with a fancy display and a very fast network/internet/wireless connections?
Except Tesla sells the most BEV vehicles in the world on a yearly basis and is almost doubling that volume year in and out.It‚Äôs not even close.Cut Tesla sales in half and you basically have the rest of the markets total BEV sales.
Held my Tesla calls overnight. Puts on my sleep
[apparently they are collaborating with TSLA](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2021/07/19/tesla-ties-leads-to-german-solar-electric-car-company-choosing-sibros-connectivity-platform/)
But but but Tesla also sells other low-margin products like solar panels and batteries, so that must mean they should be valued as a high-margin tech company.
Tesla purchasers are known for their ignorance of cars. They are like the average apple user. Yeah, a lot of devs use Apple computers, but most people who use Apples are clueless.The Porsche EVs are better.
Tesla will fly if it breaks 1100 here
Tesla is probably the least retarded though. Their forward p/e is only 100 so they are pretty fairly valued. Definately think you should try shorting them though since the loss porn could be glorious.
Ok, how about WeWork then as a decent analog. WeWork purported to be a "tech company" that could expand indefinitely and at ridiculous speeds. Real estate doesn't work that way, and neither does auto manufacturing.My point is simply that the fact people have been claiming Tesla will crash haven't been correct yet doesn't mean the fundamentals of their argument are bad.Tesla Motors is currently valued pretty close to Saudiaramco. Does that make any goddamn sense? Of course not. It's a wholly unsustainable speculative bubble and nothing more.
I have watched as Tesla has gone up and up irrationally over the last 5 years. For this reason I bit the bullet and bought 100 shares of lucid fully realizing it‚Äôs completely overvalued but hoping to ride the hype train. I also think they actually do have potential. Their tech is damn impressive and I believe in the ceo more than Elon. Rivian gives me nikola vibes tho
And similarly it makes no sense that Tesla is worth as much as the 5 largest car companies in the world combined when it sells a tiny fraction of the cars and is guaranteed never to dominate the entire market. It's funny to me that people can see how it's crazy when it's Rivian while they have a few K in Tesla and are certain it's worth even more.
I agree too many bashers on tesla. I own it for the gains. You can‚Äôt short tesla or you will be burnt.However it has been mental that Rivian got to almost 200 dollars a share with no sales or even orders from production. That is I guess my thought it just makes the market seem ridiculous. But I don‚Äôt short stocks, it just can be a bit confusing to invest as it goes against all the typical teachings of earnings, debt, profit etc
Just wait until I tell you about VW, the EV manufacturer that *already* sells about the same number of electric cars globally as Tesla does, yet trades at less than 8X earnings.
That‚Äôs a lot of bullshit. EVs produce way less emissions than ICE vehicles. Yes, there are emissions in regards to the production of the car, but they have way less parts than an ICE vehicle.On top of that, parts are produced at most of the same manufacturers that produce gas cars, and their footprint is based on how the electricity to produce parts, is generated in that region/country.Tesla for instance, produce their cars and batteries by using solar energy.Anyway - just don‚Äôt spit out ‚Äúfacts‚Äù you have heard without educating yourself. I know it is the retarded way of this sub, but you are entitled read words, arranged one after the other, into sentences
Tesla has a ROIC comparable to most tech companies, and this continues to improve QoQ. The level of profitably we see in their cars is unlike anything before, and it will only get better with better manufacturing ability. This is their moat. They are also still growing at 50%. What other company with that much revenue grows at 50%? When people say Tesla should be valued like a tech company, this is really what they mean. There have also been massive price increases just this year which go straight to the bottom line. This company is going to have comparable revenue and operating margins to Amazon in just a few years. That's being conservative. Note how I dont need to mention anything about FSD or robots. Rivian has not sold a single car and we have yet to see how well they execute mass production.They are not the same.
Yeah, but F was deeply and overly depressed last year, whereas Tesla was already flying high. It feels like there is still a big gap to close between F and the other EV makers, unless the bubble pops first.
Market cap aside, ford is up 125% the last year compared to 135% for Tesla. So market sentiment is trending similarly it seems
There are also considerable disadvantages of being a first mover. Also forget Toyota if you want, Volkswagen has cheap-ish EVs which also are serial produced.The only real advantage Tesla has left is software (and data). Which might place them at a higher value, maybe. But what happens to everything else that even just kinda looks like Tesla is just weird.
It tells you something when even the retards here couldn‚Äôt justify the Rivian and Lucid runs.With Tesla it was all ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a car company maaan‚Äù.   With these ones it‚Äôs just ‚Äúyeaaah, idk, shit just be moonin sometimes‚Ä¶‚Äù
Since investors appear to be looking for "the next Tesla", Elon is probably the reason for these sky-high EV company valuations.
I don't think you realize how much $3T is. Volkswagen (who owns Porche, Bugatti, Audi, etc) and an entire charging network is only worth 137B. You could take VW, Ford, GM, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan, Subaru, Volvo, Mazda, Ferrari and Toyota combined and only be at about $900 billion.Sure EVs may be new now but in a few years every company will have them. It'll only take a few years after that for everyone to catch up to Tesla engineering wise, you can reverse engineer to skip tons of R&ampD costs. Ford sold more Mach E's alone last year than Rivian and Lucid have sold cars in total. They have almost no competitive advantage, they aren't the cheapest, the fastest, or the most powerful, so what do they have thats worth $1T?
It's not only VW. European regulations will forbid the production of cars running on combustion engines in 2035, which in manufacturing terms is basically tomorrow. I looked up some car reviews lately (as I don't know jackshit about cars). Tesla scored worse than EVs from Hyundai or VW. It's beyond me how some people still look at the future plans of Tesla in isolation of existing car manufacturers
Tesla isn't valued by its business, it's valued by speculation and nothing more. $TSLA will crash back to Earth by 2030.Facebook and Amazon and Apple were exponentially scalable businesses really really quickly. That's what "tech companies" are uniquely able to do. Tesla isn't that. They're a car company and software developer and lifestyle brand and really nothing more.
&gtWill that be reflected in stock prices anytime in the near future? Fuck no.So you're bullish on Ford, nice. They've had a huge rally in the past few months and they're still worth 1/15th of Tesla lol
&gtRivian has a market lead ahead of Tesla in regards to their order submissions.Please pass around these drugs you are in possession of.
I expect Rivian will succeed in their market, everything I've heard about them suggests they have good leadership. But even if they are wildly successful they will not justify the current valuation. Rivian, Lucid, even Tesla will come back to earth eventually, but I have no idea when so im staying out of EV stocks in general.
It‚Äôs not just EV though. It‚Äôs all of the tech Tesla and Rivian come with. Legacy manufacturers are still years behind. The Mercedes EQ is real flashy, but the software is total shit. Literally every person that has been in my Model 3 says it‚Äôs the best car they‚Äôve been in, WHILE acknowledging the quality isn‚Äôt good enough for the price. BMW, Toyota, even my boomer father with a Dodge Ram 1500 Kinghorn Trail Fucker Edition asked if this was what a Rivian would be like, he placed an order the same day I showed him my 3.New EVs manufacturers aren‚Äôt just selling new drivetrain tech, they‚Äôre selling what most people thought the future would have looked like by now.
Elon: "Hey guys, do you want me to incorporate this company into Tesla? Like, retweet or comment YES, also follow for other economy shaking tweets like this!"
I‚Äôve been very happily driving VW electric cars since 2015. They absolutely know what they‚Äôre doing. My wife won‚Äôt let me get a Tesla because ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll look like a dork‚Äù meaning a tech bro or rich dude pretending they‚Äôre doing something for the planet.
Where are you seeing this? The only issue with Hertz is that they have to wait for the cars just like any other customer because demand is not an issue with Tesla- ramp up production is. Elon also made that ‚Äòstock price too high‚Äô comment hinting at a stock split, which happened later on. He wasn‚Äôt implying the company was over valued.
My sense is the EV valuations of the likes of Lucid and Rivian are fuelled by FOMO. Investors missed out on Tesla and fear the same with other companies in that space. The odds are stacked against them though. Should be interesting to watch play out.
unlike other shit EVs, Lucid has its own drive train technology and battery. the rest (except Tesla) just use on the shelf solutions.
Look at the volume on the $1400 calls for 2024 on tesla![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Tesla delivered just under 500k vehicles last year, VW delivered 230k EVs and even when you add the plug-in hybrids (190k) they sold less than Tesla
Having flashbacks to Tesla timers 1-5 years ago All of them are broke now
Tesla is way overvalued and no one can convince me otherwise. Its insane people really think tesla should he worth 2-3 trillion let alone 1 trillion
Tesla could make the most perfect and reliable car on earth, that wouldn't start to explain the stock valuation.If I want to understand the stock valuation of tesla, I go on twitter.
The hypocrisy in this sub is amazing. Y‚Äôall quick to jump bounce from riding the tesla hate train to riding Musks dick in a second lmao
Dude who yolo‚Äôd 50k into Tesla puts because ‚ÄúElon has more selling to do‚Äù is probably not okay today. Enjoy the ramen bear
At some point we need to realize people are investing in the traditional sense. As in they are investing in stuff they want to happen as opposed to investing just because number go up. Tesla bubble cant be popped because people want Tesla to happen.
My comment will prolly get buried but tesla isn't valued on their cars(atleast for me) it is a small part of it but its really the ev infrastructure, the mega packs and the technology behind them. I hate when people say there not just a car company but its true.
Tesla valuation is based on lies and deception. They go up when hertz says they‚Äôre buying 100k cars, then don‚Äôt go back down as much when hertz says they aren‚Äôt actually buying that many. Elon said it was overpriced when it was 1/5th it‚Äôs current valuation. The reckoning will come with the next bear market
I don't have to really even have an argument here because you're just so wrong on the face of it. Toyota did 7.5M units in all of 2020. They've done 3.9M units in 1H 2021. Your 10M unit claim is a farce. Tesla's on track to hit somewhere in the 900k units this year. But more importantly, what's Toyota's production targets for 2022? 2023? 2030? &amp#x200BHow's the BEV plan coming along?Answer: Poorly. They pretty much don't have one. They're investing in H2 and Hybrids because they didn't plan ahead and build BEV factories, design the cars to use someone else's batteries, or purchase large enough battery contracts.Also, everyone only looks a # of cars sold and calls it a day. Morons.You have to look at the ASP of all those cars and then look at margins. Tesla has higher ASP and margins.   Let's look at how that plays into things.[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/gross-margin](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/gross-margin)vs   [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TM/toyota/gross-margin](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TM/toyota/gross-margin)  TSLA TTM revenue = $46.85B (\~810k units TTM)  vs Toyota TTM Revenue = $290.23B (8.4M units TTM)So their revenue is only 6.2x higher for having sold 10.3x as many units. And their profit per car is lower too. So as Tesla grows it's own sales faster than the global auto market expands, those sales for Tesla are going to be loses for other companies, Toyota included. Someone will choose a 3 over a Camry. A Y over a Rav4.  So when Tesla has grown to \~5M units a year, they'll be making more money than Toyota ever has. When Tesla grows to 10M a year, they'll not only be rolling in dough, but will have eaten the lunch off of so many other auto's plates. TESLA DRINKS YOUR MILKSHAKE, TOYOTA!  Tesla to 20M units by 2030-32.
I bought Tesla very hesitantly at 250ea then made a great escape at the ridiculous bubble price of 450 (I felt). Never underestimate how retarded it can get.
i'm getting the Enron scam vibe with all the EV IPOs.1. we already have the first scam (Nikola Corporation)2. scale up is hard for a newbie car maker. just look at Tesla timeline and how fuck their production until recently3. all talks and no sales with massive hype 4. retail investors seem to forgot that we still have legacy car maker like Toyota. i bet if Toyota went all in and just pump up EV car and sell it for low price. all the newbie EV car makers will die within a year. you can't beat Toyota on production and qualityeven if EV is the future, the market cap is just bullshit even Tesla is overpriced.ride this scam wave and cash out as much as you can. this is not sustainable.
Lower than what? Rivian haven't sold a single carI'm not saying the F150 lightning would be a big commercial success, I'm saying nobody in his right mind would pay more for an ugly looking car made by a company that never produced cars in its entire existence when they can have a derivative of one of the most sold car on the planet (which I suppose is for a reason). Keep in mind that tesla still can't make a proper car after 12 years of building cars.
listen. i buy tesla at 1000. why? because i think stonk become zonk. stonk do become zonk. i have net $1. if i give it a week, i might even net $10. i do not think. i just wait for stonk to become zonk.Thank you.
Tesla is over-evaluated but rivian and lucid are just scam at these point, no product, no tech, no market.
Yeah, but there is literally no reason the electric vehicle industry should be worth 10x what the old auto industry was in terms of market cap. Where is the logic behind that? People aren't magically going to have 5-10x the money to dump into their transportation / car purchasing budget.Tesla + Rivian + Lucid market cap is like 2x the value of the rest of the entire auto industry. Makes 0 sense no matter how you slice it.
Tesla bros can't handle another meme stock rivaling tsla
‚ÄúPlans‚Äù, well we all know how all that often goes.  Especially if you watch Tesla talk about their ‚Äúplans‚Äù.
Tesla: Taddddaaaaa!!!!  Rivian: Vuwalllllllaaaaaa!!!
How many "Tesla is overvalued" - posts must a community suffer from
back when tesla was 170 a share a tesla bull has to go through a shitton of mental gymastics to justify its valuenow these new EV companies can just point at tesla and say "our multiples are just sLiGhTlY wOrSe"
You have people in this space, that have been doing Uninterruptible Power Supplies for decades in the commercial markets.  They are seeing this and going after residential now.  I‚Äôve been seeing adds for Generac home batteries for instance.  It‚Äôs not really anything new or unique , it‚Äôs marketing, which obviously can be all the difference.  But unlike EVs, Tesla really isn‚Äôt out front or innovative here.
And Tesla didn't invent the electric car, they just figured out how to build one efficiently.
Got in at $106.75 got out at $100 like an idiot. Bought $100 puts yesterday for Jan 22 when it was at $169, might not want to do what I do since I only lose money when I invest in anything other than Tesla.
&gt How many CEOs are willing to sleep at the factory and be there for weeks to resolve manufacturing issues?He caused half of them in the first place by trying to build an 'alien dreadnought'.&gt They finished their factory before their permit got approved. German government bureaucracy and paper work took longer than it took tesla to build the entire fucking factory.How do you know Rivian can't build that fast either? They at least plan to build 2 new factories by the end of 2023, and they've got plenty of ex-Tesla employee to do it.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-adds-stand-alone-battery-133000188.html
Rivian investors realizing that Lucid is Tesla 2.0
if you're using the words "next tesla" to justify your investments i am happy you are going broke
It's a bubble that values solely EV companies like tech companies.VW sold more EVs that anyone else worldwide last year and so clearly have the concept, brand recognition and production capacity and yet are somehow mere fractions of what Tesla, Rivian etc are worth
The greater fool theory‚Ä¶ its basically Russian roulette with more payoff Tesla to 10k
Wow! 100,000 trucks?! ThAtS SoOoO kEwL!GM, Toyota, VW, etc sell MILLIONS of cars a year. They are developing their own EVs and have the infrastructure in place already to scale up, where Rivian and Tesla do not. By the time these garage shop EV makers catch up, it will be too late. Also, I don‚Äôt think your average person understands how difficult it is to sell cars for a profit. Yes, the EV market is a ginormous bubble.
How large can Tesla get by that point. If it doubles again it‚Äôs largest market cap and if it doubles after that it‚Äôs worth more than the next top 10 essentially. A year ago TSLA was worth $440 A year from now TSLA is worth $3600?
But Tesla also got that creepy dancing robot coming out that people will program to give them handjobs so... The sky is the limit!
Toyota is producing gas cars, which is going to be on its way out. Just sell half your Tesla holdings and sit on the decision for a few days. You may realize you‚Äôve made a mistake and buy back in. Or if you truly think it‚Äôs a bubble, then sell the rest. Easy.
If I were you AND I loved being poor, I would sell tesla.
Was the combustion engine in a bubble in the early 1900s simply because there were more horses on the road than cars and investors valued ICE makers at a higher multiple?   Buddy... you're comparing Toyota to Tesla, but Toyota doesn't even believe in the EV concept. They should be punished further in the share price.   As far as Rivian goes, sure it's overvalued. but EV is the future.
I am selling half position in Tesla and buying Lucid, I think there are more room to rise in Lucid than in Tesla, what do you think?
The year is 2075, EVs are now the only industry left. Eloncoin has become the world's reserve currency. Tesla is now a 100 trillion Eloncoin company and owns several planets. In addition to providing transportation, EVs nourish our physical bodies and provide shelter while we live our entire lives in the metaverse.There is no more war and no more unhappiness. Everything is perfect.
Someone on the TESLA facebook group said they just got their Model 3 in FL and it was delivered with NO USB charging ports. Just plastic blanks‚Ä¶ and was told they will replace the blank with the actual chargers when they have the parts. Until then, drive your $60k with no phone chargers. LMFAO what the actual hell ü§£Edit: TSLA Tards are defending it in the comments saying ‚Äúyes, completely okay bc chip shortage. At least it‚Äôs not a BMW that comes with No touch screen‚Äù HOW TF IS THAT A COMPARABLE DEFENSE ü§£ü§£
&gt Business Adminstration is a useless degree. You can expect to make $150,000 working at Tesla
I sold Tesla twice because ‚Äúit was overvalued and couldn‚Äôt go higher‚Äù and bought back in when it did.
It can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs already at 90B and is more of a niche market player. Maybe 5x though with all the licensing of tech they could do. People forget Tesla had way fewer shares and smaller market cap. If we only knew what was coming....
$150 is a lot cheaper than Tesla $1000BTW what's Market Cap? What's a bag holder ? üòï
Superchargers charge at upwards of 200 mph.  (In 1 hour plugged in at a super charger, you gain 200 miles of range).  For earlier Teslas, this is the equivalent of "filling up the tank."If you get a NEMA 14-50 port, you can charge at 32 to 40mph.  So if you have 200 miles of range on your car, you can "fill up the tank" in 5 to 8 hours.  Again, not a big deal.  I come home from work, I charge at night and I'm topped off in the morning.If I plug my Tesla into a regular plug... at your house... I'm charging at 3 to 5mph.  If I have a 200 mile battery, that's 40-hours.  Okay, I don't need a full charge, I just need enough to get to the next Supercharger... fine.    But still, your life is going to be consumed by charging instead of life.
Fun fact: PlainSite has been posting bogus TSLAQ claims about Tesla for several years.  Fun fact: PlainSite author Aaron Greenspan claims to have invented Facebook and then been stolen from by Zuckerberg.
Yeah, Tesla tried to lie about that with my GC company too... To bad we had signed change orders from Tesla's Project Executive for every single "made up" charge...
Rivian makes tesla look reasonableConsidering Tesla is batshit insane valuation that‚Äôs saying something
I just did 1000+ miles in a Tesla and the supercharger network combined with autopilot made it so easy. My kids were asking to pee before the car needed a charge each time. And you don‚Äôt normally have to fill up to 100% every time you stop with the super chargers. Going from 10% to 80% is way faster than 80%-100%. I‚Äôd spend maybe 15 minutes at each supercharger getting to ~80%+ and then moving on to the next one. Car knows where are the chargers are and routes you accordingly. It‚Äôs a breeze.Also, deff not same as gas cost. Some charge per minute and some per kWh. Most my stops were $10 or less.
Sold Tesla today at $1,046 for a nice profit. Think I‚Äôm gonna stay mostly cash, feels like a correction is in the cards. But will slam the buy button any time Tesla goes under 1,000 again.
Elon is more than HALF way done selling. $1000 has been defended. No more downs. Only up.If rivian is 140b on 0 revenue then Tesla is worth 10 trillion.
No, dumbass. The people who post anti tesla stuff on the twitter account you linked to are being paid to post that stuff. You are literally so stupid that you are promoting it for free. I'm just trying to help you stop being dumb and poor, but clearly some people can't be helped.
I grabbed a few shares. Getting serious Tesla 2018/ 2019 vibes here right now. This is farrrrr different then Rivian.
I get reddit hates him and I don't like Elon as much as I used to but Elon is a huge plus lol, Tesla is where it is both it's dominance on EV in America and stock price only because of Elon. If Elon died tomorrow God forbid, that stock is falling 90%.
Tesla has a wider variety of products than just cars and are consistently developing new tech. That's why I like them. Not that I dislike the other evs they all will do fine in the long run
Before you start making assumptions there needs to be established if they actually breached contractual obligations, seeing as JPM's claims have been disputed by Tesla.
Through 2020 Tesla is -5.69B all time. Last year they made a net profit of $690M. Through 9 months this year they‚Äôve recorded a net profit of $3.3B. That puts them at -2.39B. They‚Äôll be net profitable by the end of 2022 most likely.And debt free.
It‚Äôs not like that. Why do you think tesla shot up 1000% randomly within a year? The share price was suppressed through a sustained FUD campaign from the myriad of industries that stand to lose + their retarded lackeys that lurk in the wretched bowels of the Internet
No money currently invested in TSLA but TSLA's free cash flow alone during 2020 would have more than covered their liabilities with JPM...... This is just verifiably wrong if anybody cared to look at numbers for the 2020 earnings. They were net positive on debt/cash going into their inclusion and they were paying just under 100 million in interest payments annually. There was no time where the redemption of this debt would have put Tesla negative on quarterly earnings. This is obviously a smear piece by somebody who is butthurt that Tesla blew up their holdings or has some kind of motive to bash EV because they have investments heavy in somewhere like lets say...... oil/gas?
Ford still getting valued as a legacy automaker whereas rivian is getting valued like a tech stock. Despite both having, ostensibly, the same forward vision.If ford can transition to convincing investors to look at it the same way they do rivian, lucid, canoo, or tesla, then it'll rocket. If not, it'll stay more or less where it is.
You forgot a few other points. It‚Äôs main product is a truck, Americans love trucks and it‚Äôs window didn‚Äôt break. It‚Äôs a new ev, and people are hungry to grab since some probably missed the Tesla rocket. And it don‚Äôt have a tweeting owner who fucks with the stock price on a near constant basis so we can expect it to always climb
SpaceX is not a part of Tesla. Musk likely won‚Äôt take SpaceX public because then he would have to answer to shareholders.
Tesla will of course open up their network to other EV brands. And they‚Äôll get paid for it. Tesla is a tech company, automaker, battery manufacturer, and fuel company all rolled into one. It‚Äôs still over valued but it‚Äôs not as bad as if you just straight up compare it to other automakers.
Yes!!! Soon it will be where Tesla is for no fricken reason and then the tsla fanboys will really start bitching üçø I got my popcorn üëÄ
Fun fact: That is actually NOT news, it is a cross post from realtesla which links to a Twitter post that was bought and paid for by tslaq. Tslaq has been around for years. It has been funded by groups that have financial interests in harming tesla and stopping the widespread adoption of EVs. Unfortunately they have also pulled in a bunch of useful idiot keyboard warriors along the way. Anyone interested in the topic of this post should look for legitimate and credible sources of information and actually think for yourself before making financial decisions.
Wonder if LCID gonna kill as many shorts as Tesla did?
tesla to 42069üöÄ
Tesla looks undervalued now compared to RIVN.
Yeah and Tesla is going to make all the money from the charging of everyone elses vehicles.
All it takes is Congress slipping a line into a bill requiring interoperability and Tesla is forced to let everyone else use their network, eliminating the competitive advantage.It might not even require legislation. The justice department can argue that it's anticompetitive and monopolistic and get a court order forcing them to open it up.Either way, the days of exclusivity are numbered.
They use 2170 cells and modules. Nothing special. Carbon sleeved tesla motors are the best tech in the industry for powertrain. 4680 and structural pack are the next level for battery tech. Lucid has no special sauce. Nice tech but nothing above tesla.
Maybe but they don't have it yet. Just like Tesla said they would release the plaid plus that would outclass the lucid air which never happened.
* $465M DoE ATVM loan (available to all companies), repaid* 1.5B in EV credits (available to all companies Tesla is now maxed out)* &lt2B in other local/state/federal subsidies, the vast majority of which is in the form of solar related grantsCompare to:$50B to GM$33B to Ford4.6B to Toyota
Tesla was heavily subsidized they didn't take as much risk as people like to claim.
Yeah at that valuation "overvalued" Tesla was delivering 200K+ cars per year.
As a longtime Tesla bull....RIVN valuation is crazy.
If you own an EV, you‚Äôll quickly discover that other networks besides Tesla are pretty shitty.They are usually very small with 2 outlets being normal. Tesla Supercharger stations are typically 8+.They are usually slower, with Tesla putting out 120 kW or 250 kW depending if it is v2 or v3. Most third party networks top out at 50 kW, with the exception of Electrify America.Finally, maintenance is a problem. I would say about 33% of the time I try a random charger or network it is just broken. Tesla has real time intelligence on the Supercharger network and can tell you if any chargers are down inside your car browser.
Sell and you will cry because Tesla and lucid have a higher valuation than the world economy by 2025.
Elon Musk is the only reason Tesla is worth anything. If Elon Musk owned Ford they would also be worth 1 trillion.
We now hate Tesla and will only invest in rivn. This is the way
They would be mandated to open them by law, if they didn't opt into it. It'd be a terrible world where every EV manufacturer has to make their own charging network, and none were compatibleI suspect Tesla realizes that and is why they are opening up
Speaking as a Chevy bolt driver who has experience with CCS, but no actual experience with superchargers, there is no comparison.  Tesla‚Äôs network of chargers makes a lot of difference. It‚Äôs one reason my next EV will be a Tesla.
I think Elon does not view the Supercharger network being exclusive as a long-term benefit. Right now demand for EV's will outweigh supply regardless of Supercharger exclusivity or not, so to the extent there is excess Supercharger capacity that can be shared, it does not hurt Tesla. Also, by operating this way, it forces Tesla to remain focused on being innovative and competitive in the cars themselves which is what Elon seems to think is key to success and not trying to crush your competitors with exclusivity (he has implied or maybe even outright said he does not like the Apple model). I think also by opening up the Supercharger network now, they reduce the incentive of others to build fast charging and that allows the Supercharger to be a substantial revenue stream down the line.
And charging for it. :)  Either you pay the same price as a Tesla per kwh for a \~$15 a month fee, or you pay double per kwh. It's going to be a net win, and help them deploy more SC stations faster.
Tesla is opening up their network to other cars. I spoke to the regional sales manager in Orange County, CA about it. Buy puts or stfu retard.
Yes exactly, Tesla opening up for everyone to use their networkincentivizes other organizations to not open their ownthus strengthening Tesla's network and allowing them to continue to expand to the point where they can set prices and/or restrict access at their choosing
The real reason tesla is worth anything is that they have proven they can produce and sell cars. That is the hurdle all these upstarts need to overcome.
Since Tesla took the risk and built the network I feel like offering open network incentives should be part of our infrastructure deal.I don‚Äôt expect Tesla to make them open for no reason - but it‚Äôs good for the industry for them to be - so we should absolutely offer incentives for a certain percentage of the superchargers to be open.
Here in Europe Tesla is opening up it‚Äôs network for everyone. Tesla or no Tesla.
Charging networks need to be open / compatible for EVs to take over gas stations &amp ICE vehicles anyway. EV companies eating each other with competing &amp incompatible standards is a sure path to the entire industry failing. What‚Äôs the biggest concern people have with EVs, aside from the high prices? Range. People at least need *the option* to drive cross-country for the holidays, or for college or a new job while hauling a UHaul and stopping overnight in podunk shithole towns and rest stops that *have to have chargers* or else gas cars win. So, you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs a key selling point, but as more *vehicles* hit the roads, Tesla is already on track to become the next Exxon-Mobile-Shell for the entire EV industry. That‚Äôs their play for when they can no longer compete on cupholders and fancy seats.
I hold Tesla because SpaceX ‚Äúpurchases‚Äù software, hardware and other thangs from Tesla according to Tesla‚Äôs annual report. I don‚Äôt care about electric skateboards. They just pay the bills for Space.Love how Elons accountants work.
tesla bro fails again:https://insideevs.com/news/545115/lucid-air-fast-charging-250kw/
Rivian going to a trillion, lucid going to a trillion, Tesla takes over the world. Ford stays at $19
You could have just used their projections. They plan to fill all 55k pre-orders by the end of 2023, 55k x 75k = $4.125 billion. They also plan to deliver 100k amazon vans by the end of 2023. No idea what they're paying so we'll call it $35k. 35k x 100k = $3.5 billionSo an average of $3.8 billion. If they hit that they'll be far outpacing Tesla who didn't hit that until their 5th year public. I'm in for the long haul. The product is far superior to Tesla and far superior to any other pick up truck on the market.
Tesla investors suddenly focusing on value when it comes to Rivian and Lucid ü§°
Yeah their entire team are Tesla folks who built their top models and got tired of Elon‚Äôs antics
'member when they said this about Tesla (pre-split)?
Good analytics? Rivian is full of ex Tesla engineers, and if OP thinks one company has significantly better engineers than the other he doesn‚Äôt really know what he‚Äôs talking about
Tesla will never be below $900 again
Elon is a Master Slave.His empire would not exist if it were not for  the Industrial Military Complex, because all those overseas Lithium Mines are built on land stolen from Native people, so now the only way they can survive is by being exploited for slave labor by the Industrial Lithium Mining Corporation also know as *Tesla*. **Elons taxes go back to build the Great American War Machines that made his empire possible in the first place.***More than half of the world‚Äôs lithium resources lies beneath the salt flats in the Andean regions of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, where indigenous quinoa farmers and llama herders must now compete with miners for water in one of the world‚Äôs driest regions.**Lithium mining requires huge amounts of groundwater to pump out brines from drilled wells, and some estimates show that almost 2 million litres of water are needed to produce one ton of lithium.**In Chile‚Äôs Salar de Atacama, lithium and other mining activities consumed 65% of the water, causing groundwater depletion, soil contamination and other forms of environmental degradation, forcing local communities to abandon ancestral settlements.**As demand for lithium increases and production is tapped from deeper rock mines and brines, the challenges of mitigating environmental risk will increase,‚Äù the report says.*https://unctad.org/news/developing-countries-pay-environmental-cost-electric-car-batteriesNow, with all the recent events going on for the past 20 years, one might be able to see why certain arid and lithium rich places in the Middle East, like Afghanistan, might be more resistant to Industrial Expansion, that would destroy what little natural water resources they have left.*The approximate amount of lithium on earth is between 30 and 90 million tons. That means we'll will run out eventually, but we're not sure when. PV Magazine states it could be as soon as 2040, assuming electric cars demand 20 million tons of lithium by then*.Jul 19, 2021‚ÄùTho if worse comes to worse and all of the rivers near lithium mines are polluted with lithium tailings, at least then we will have a large amount of free sedatives!
He could just set up a GoFundMe and the Tesla fan boys would gladly donate to pay off the debt
Bezos, that's why I'm scared of shorting.  Musk *seems* petty.  He gets into a twitter fight with Bernie, calls someone a pedophile.  Yucks it up when he crosses Bezos as Richest Man.   Silly shit, end of the day he's just another autistic ape.  A super-ape, but an ape.Bezos.  Bezos is a real dick.  Bezos mined data from Amazon Marketplace just to fuck small retailers.  Bezos bought a newspaper so he could have a dedicated op-ed page throwing shit at Trump.  Bezos is petty as fuck.  Bezos will fund the fuck out of Rivian, just to ensure there's a Tesla rival.  Bezos will throw mountains of fucking cash at Rivian just on the hopes that it will in some small way fuck with Musk.
If TSLA closes above 1050 I beat my meatIf TSLA closes below 1050 I beat my childrenChoose wisely Tim Tesla
Interesting read. I just can't get over the quite franky obsurd valuation of this company.Love the truck, looks well made and full of cool features, but even when compared to Tesla the valuation is absolutely insane. Just can't bring myself to trade on it in either direction.
That's what I mean.All EVs are valued based on Tesla, that's the equivalent of making a GPU related company and having your valuation based purely on the fact that NVDA is worth $750b.
He‚Äôd have to sell like .01% of his shares to pay that lmao But it‚Äôs Teslas debt not Elons. And Tesla has billions in cash right now.
Bro...buy puts instead so you define losses. This is literally Tesla level retarded and can go up forever.
I'm not complaining about his success, I acknowledge it. I'm pointing out the absurd hypocrisy of basing your businesses on one area of complex federal law that greatly benefits him, then turning around and bitching about complex tax law that requires him to pay taxes on the profit he makes from the government. He wants the benefit of the law without paying his share under the law. If he wants to be a free market icon, he should make his money without the government's help. Tesla loses money on making and selling cars, they are only profitable because of electric car credits created by the government he hates/is totally dependent upon.
&gt Been around almost as long as Tesla.Tesla is 18 years old, Rivian is 12 years old.It took Tesla 9 years to release the Model S (yes they had the roadster but that was a super low volume proof of concept). The Model 3 has only been in production for 4 years and the Model Y for less than 2 years.
Tesla cars are the worse. They are empty inside. Quality is horrible. For a 55k CAD car here in Canada I can buy benz of the year which actually has quality. I don‚Äôt understand how they got people to buy their overpriced shit. Literally a toy joke car!
Tesla is also only profitable because of federal law requiring auto manufacturers who don't make electric cars to buy credits from those who do.  Between Tesla and SpaceX, the dude's entire business models completely depend on federal regulations and payments, so bitching about tax law is incredibly myopic. He is peak entitlement.
Oh no and daddy Elon also said Tesla would have level 5 self driving by the end of the year I actually feel like OP has been grossly mislead lol
Ive been a Tesla bull for years‚Ä¶ Elon giveth and Elon taketh But look at the chart‚Ä¶ bulls always win
Well RIVN beat tesla to market with a midsize pickup truck
Rivian highly undervalued. By the time they start selling the same amount of cars as Tesla they will cost 5 million each from inflation. Thats like 10 Trillion in annual revenue at least. Fire sale!
As long as Tesla grows at 50% a year it will continue to be overvalued. I think it will stay over valued for another 10 years or so. Then PE will tank to a normal level.
Rivian isn‚Äôt Tesla. Tesla isn‚Äôt even sure it‚Äôs Tesla.
So is Tesla.Don't get me wrong.. Tesla is the future I agree and it definitely is a good company which creates lots of value.But it is grossly overvalued right now.I hope to get a chance to buy it for a nice discount soon.
You think Tesla has battery tech and full self driving AI.That's cute.
Trucks are outselling cars, Tesla quality control is non-existent, the Tesla truck is fugly
I mean‚Ä¶ taking a company that doesn‚Äôt have a prospectus with less than 1000 vehicles delivered and turning it into the worlds most valuable auto manufacturer isn‚Äôt founding the company but you‚Äôre plain delusional if you think he isn‚Äôt the individual most responsible for Teslas success. His ability to identify and collaborate with engineers in unprecedented and this is really what has made Tesla so dominant: immense R&ampD spend with an engineering oriented CEO that is willing to be agile as fuck.
Been around almost as long as Tesla. In that time they've just about managed *a* deal with Amazon. Seems Bezos is just tryna stick his dick in Musk's stirred porridge. In the same time Elon has created a trillion dollar car maker, and beat Amazon to space. Rivian is a fucking pump and dump.
You're comparing Tesla today to Rivian today, which is an inaccurate comparison.Compare Rivian to Tesla back when Tesla was 150 billion market cap.
I think this is more "shortable" than Tesla due to missing cult following
It's funny... Tesla is so over-valued that Musk can only dump a tenth of a percent of the company at a time.I suspect that as long as it stays above about $800/share, Elon is going to be daring anyone and everyone to "make him sell".
That's something that's doing the rounds now which is a weird one.Everyone thinks he founded Tesla now.
It's hilarious how tesla sold EV credits for cars that never made it to market to casinos and traditional car manufacturers
Anyone else think tesla is about to eat shit? Musk knows sonething we dont, looking for excuses to sell. Maybe they where gas cars all along.
Elon dismantled the Tesla PR department a few years ago...are people still unaware of that?It's great. There is literally no one there to comment on stories involving the company lmao
Basically none of you will understand this unless you read the lawsuit.Its linked to complex clauses in the call spread transactions in which Tesla was counterparty to various investment banks for their convertibles to raise the premiums.
At the rate Tesla and SpaceX is growing‚Ä¶way longer than you think
‚ÄúTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and has disbanded its US press team.‚ÄúBullish
This. He was always a super villain, the memes were just blinding you. Ask the founders of Tesla.
What‚Äôs that quote that‚Äôs always thrown around? ‚ÄúIf you owe the bank 100$ that‚Äôs your problem, if you owe the bank 100mill that‚Äôs their problem‚Äù Tesla to 1500 EOW
&gt Tesla is insolvent. They need to raise $2 billion in cash by the end of 2020 or they can't pay their bills and will go bankrupt.
short Tesla into tmmrw. Liking this JP Morgan lawsuit for my shorts
&gt Ianndinardo noted that electric trucks like the Tesla Semi are actually a good fit for the logging industry, especially in Vancouver Island, where much of the timber is located in higher elevations. This means that a significant part of the energy consumed by the trucks when they go up to the mountains could be replenished as they travel back, thanks to features like regenerative braking. &gt‚ÄúAs they come down the hill loaded, they‚Äôre able to regenerate energy and put that back into their batteries so in this cycle going up the hill empty and coming down the hill loaded they can generate their own battery supply on a daily basis,‚Äù the Mosaic Forest Management executive said. https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-semi-logging-trucks-canada/Nikola probably couldn‚Äôt even generate electricity going down hill.
Also, the PayPal board removed him while he was on a flight to Australia. Hm, wonder why. Also weird how googling stuff about him gets you mountains of clear clickbait shit that I‚Äôm *sure* he had no role in creating. Also the whole ‚Äúgot sued by the original founder of Tesla when he tried to rewrite history to claim he was the originator of the idea‚Äù thing. He‚Äôs always been a big jerk, and reading his tweets, from the mean to the delusional (the shit about human consciousness which you get from a high undergrad who just took their first psychology and astronomy classes). The flaunting of giving basically nothing back in charity/good works, the blatant SEC violations. It all comes across more like ‚Äúasshole Robber baron from 1898 with Twitter‚Äù instead of ‚Äúquirky tech guy‚Äù.
I'm a TSLA bear but that's just nonsense.  He cares about both.He's like the opposite of a hands off CEO focused only on "strategy" and the "big picture".  Deeply involved engineer in technical shit, insanely knowledgeable not just all the complicated insides of the car itself but scaling / manufacturing / production.Very smart and probably needs some other smaller projects to diversify his interests.  His ultimate goal is space but he knows he still needs to be very involved with Tesla.
&gt Elon Musk is selling Tesla stonk to Elon Musk.
This is an expansion of the mega charger network to a Nevada factory, so the reach of these semis just expanded.Also, there has been a long delay in commercial development from the battery and chip shortages. This image is bolstered alongside an anticipated first delivery to PepsiCo of these trucks - the first real commercial sale to a non-Tesla user.
I've seen and heard it all now.The Tesla people calling out all the other EV companies as being WAY OVER VALUED... Rivian, Lucid, Fisker... etc.Well... where the fuck have they been since it went public in 2010?I think the more likely explanation is... Tesla has sank by $200 in 10 days... and people are pissed.Well get used to all that money leaving Tesla folks... competition heating up and these plays are in their infancy.
I've felt for a while now that Musk wants to get out of Tesla so that he can focus on SpaceX. I don't think he cares too much about the valuation (although it is a nice bonus).
When Tesla was kindof worthless and almost bankrupt, he worked for free with a option of purchasing stocks at an agreed upon price, if he got the stock very high and to stay very high.  This was executed and he can then buy stocks, but that will force him to pay taxes. So I dont believe he sold it because he thinks the stock is going down, I think he sold it so he can buy the stocks and pay taxes. If he does something else with the money I dont think it is material, but of course it may be that he also wants to put more cash into starlink and other projects to accellerate growth.  If you look at his track record, he has been earning money in companies and reinvesting in other companies, so I would expect more action from Tesla Solar, Star Link, SpaceX etc.
You have to wait until it's down 90% to  get a full refund and a free Tesla rental for your aggravation. The way to get the full refund is on page 69 of the user agreement.
true, but downhill is the only comparable metric when sizing up nikola/tesla thanks to king retard Milton
Anyone else feel like Elon is just using Bernie as an excuse to pull out as much cash out of the Tesla stock without freaking too many people out because he knows it's over valued?
He‚Äôs the biggest socialist for only billionaires pays no taxes but is government subsidized in every single one of his businesses . It‚Äôs absolutely a huge POS move. Fuck Elon I sold my Tesla and his backed cryp bs
wsb Tesla meta:Step 1: follow ElonStep 2: wait new tweetStep 3: profit
I had the chance to buy Tesla a couple of years ago, but didn't because I do not trust nor like Elon. Don't regret it, at all.
Tesla isn‚Äôt considered overvalued until it‚Äôs market cap surpasses that of the USA
I accidentally timed the market perfectly that day by buying Tesla weekly puts within thirty seconds of him tweeting that. Didn't find out until a little bit later he even said that because I don't have a Twitter account. That was about my only success with Tesla whether long or short.
As a cheapskate that bought several ‚ÄúiPhone killers‚Äù over the years, I‚Äôm skeptical of the legacy players that think they can just jump on the new tech bandwagon.My Nokia N8 had specs that rivalled the iPhone, but I can assure you it was a janky piece of shit full of impractical bloatware and half finished apps. From smartphones to fighter jets, it‚Äôs not _that_ difficult for existing players to design competing hardware. But Musk himself says that the tooling, supply chain and manufacturing is ‚Äú10,000% more difficult‚Äù than designing the product.Anyone can come up with a product that appears to stand up to Tesla on paper. But executing the entire experience better than Tesla is going to be extremely difficult.
Tesla to $100? Cool just bought my put options expiring end of year.
I'm just saying Tesla stock is inflated and everyone knows it.
Elon sold cause he wanted to and was looking for an excuse.  So he made a twitter poll to put the blame on.  He had options expiring he wanted to exercise.  and he has loans out with his shares as collateral he needed to pay off.and also Tesla survives largely on government subsidies.
Tesla bulls wanna show us, that they can't hold $1000 twice.
&gt I do like money. I just don't care about TESLA
Just bought a Tesla out of the money call. This horse is a fucking crazy ride
Tesla options are a hell of a drug!
Dude fuck. Last week I buy calls Tesla crashes. This week I have a put and Tesla decides to go up‚Ä¶
&gt "Tesla bears are dead in the street" is a quote from Elon Musk.
The markets and this sub will forget about in 16 hours, Tesla will be up 10,000x in a week.Literally every time Musk does something crazy and everyone anticipates a crash, the stock just explodes. It‚Äôs like Bizzaro world‚Ä¶.. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he has the Tesla factories all demolished and stopped all production leading to a 10x surge in TSLA price
Tesla setting up to fuck a lot of people over
I was up 300% and sold at $1,219 when he tweeted about Hertz. Thanks for the gains Elon, but I‚Äôm not going to invest in a company that is fucking lying to me about something as big as that ‚Äúcontract‚Äù‚ÄúTesla Hertz puts‚Äù
I find a little irony, in all the Tesla drama, that the people most hurt by the Elon sell-off drama will probably be disproportionately his poorest TSLA bulls, who can only really invest in risky calls.Not blaming Elon. He has a right to do what he wants with his stocks. But I just find it a bit ironic his jab at Sanders is also gonna screw over the poorest investors.
Tesla is so over valued idk how you can be mad at him selling. You should have been out a long time ago lmao.
Tesla os only profitable because of carbon rebate scam the government set up.
Some of you guys are ok, don't drive a Tesla today.
Iv bought Tesla calls one time in my life and literally the same day he tweeted ‚ÄúTesla stock too high IMO‚Äù never again will I take that gamble
quit buying Tesla retards
Tesla Investors: "why is everyone panicking at this drop? its literally just because the CEO is unloading a fukton of shares at the top and looking for excuses to sell even more, whats the big deal?"
People selling Tesla to buy Rivian
It was a bigger deal, on a practical level, when Consumer Reports gave them an "excellent" rating. Tesla becamea big deal when boomers started picking them over Cadillac and BMW as their retirement rides.
whats LCID PE? people quote PE to call Tesla overvalued all the time. but when Tesla was at the current lucide valuation, they were delivering a whole lot more cars.
Elons reputation is fucked until next month when Tesla ATH. out of all the politicians to go after you for Bernie lmao. this dude is losing it.
People buying Tesla are mad annoying. Just let that shit drop
Ellon is such a fuken free loader. Cali and along other tax incentives helped Tesla become what is is today and now he bitches about paying tax? Fuck off Ellon you dirtbag.
Tesla fanboys
Just remember there is a reason Tesla after all these years is pushing the 3 instead of the S and X ‚Ä¶ The market for 100k EV‚Äôs is very very low especially now with the Porsche and Benz EV‚Äôs in that same price range . Benz will use the tech to make a cheaper version guaranteed just like they do with the S class and E class Lucid needs a 50-60k max released in the next couple years to maintain this market cap .
Tesla fanboys in shambles
Watching Tesla puts move into the money after only holding an hour is orgasmic
I'm indirectly short on Tesla and even I think this is bad...
I remember when Tesla model S won this award.  If I would have just held onto my stock back then I'd be a whole lot richer.
can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs idiots still buying Tesla shares they remind me of the local crack head in my city people just keep giving him free crack and he loves it
Next time tesla runs Elon gon say the n word üíØ
Tesla loss porn could be epic this week
TESLA WAS 100k+ AT FIRST TOO.FFS why do people keep using this as an argument? CoMpaRe iT wItH a tEsLA ... Tesla is the Ford in EV market, the first guy, the rock. Lucid is SUPPOSED to be the Ferrari. No one looks at a Ferrari and says, "But compare it a Ford."
Where are the Tesla fan boys at????
&gt I think Elon is an eccentric, mentally unstable genius who's on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I'm not sure if Tesla will be able to survive without him because he was its visionary and it's hard for me to see how anyone else could fill that role.
‚ÄúAll it requires is some foresight.‚Äù ü§£Betting on all car manufacturers just giving up and letting Tesla absorb their market share is a little more than foresight. You‚Äôre gambling on an incredible uncertainty happening. And in the meantime, it has already been priced into the stock, so your future expected returns will be minimal.
Elon Musk invested $6.5 Million in Tesla in 2004 and he is now worth $200 Billion.Your parents invested $300 Thousand in your gender studies degree and now you are worth $15 / hour.
Every time there is a whisper of a possibility of Tesla being discussed in a stock thread, it is obligatory that someone will have this revelation that Tesla P/E is too high for comfort and they will share this new found knowledge with the rest of the internet.
Tesla bags huh?
Shorting Tesla.
My friend just lost 10k on Tesla calls this Friday, I told him not to do it and now he‚Äôs broke asf and only makes 10 an hour
Which reporting? CNBC estimates his taxes at ~$15B and says he has sold ~$6B.https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-elon-musks-5point7-billion-tesla-stock-sale.html
&gtLmao Elon is  just trying to unload when tesla is overpriced, and trying to pretend that politicians are asking him to. Literally no one asked him to.This. He knows it is overvalued currently, he knows this won't last forever. It's a good time to dump and wait for it go back down as it inevitably will, in which case he can buy it all back at a discount. Elon is in it for Elon, and only Elon. He doesn't give a fuck about you. If you can ride this wave with him and make money, congratulations, you're doing well, but make sure you plan an exit.
I don‚Äôt think Tesla is overvalued. Automated driving is going to disrupt the hell out of society. It will replace most means of transportation. Trucks, taxis regular cars. Tesla is positioned so far ahead that it‚Äôs extremely unlikely any other company could even come close. Tesla has the data. And since every car has cameras they‚Äôre getting way more than any other company can.And they have the passionate engineers who believe they are working hard for a good cause ‚Äúsave the planet‚Äù. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see Tesla continue to skyrocket
Dont listen to Elon. Guy can tweet he's dismantling or nuking all the tesla vehicles and Elon's fanboys will still buy his stock because they think he's Iron Man.
1 everyone knows its overvalued2 this is like the 3rd time elons publicly said "tesla is overvalued"3 tesla being "overvalued" has zero impact on its stock price
&gtWhen the CEO himself is giving signs that they think their stock is overpriced, I think it's time to start taking note. Uh.....why didn't you start taking [note in September 2020 when he made similar remarks?](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/28/musk-tesla-may-be-overvalued-today-but-i-think-itll-be-worth-more-in-5-years.html) .......it's not like this is something new that hasn't happened before....&gtThis whole thing about Elon trying to cash out some stock to pay taxes as a nice guy, was an obvious BS excuse. Uh...how is that? Taking like 10 minutes to do the 6th grade level math required might shed some light here....so lets look at the facts:* [Musk takes no cash salary](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/156459021022604/1?cik=1318605&amphl=44798:45157&amphl_id=e1yik_9po) and is only compensated in TSLA shares* He was awarded 22.8mm shares of stock option awards at a strike price of ***$6.24*** per share, which he would need to exercise by August 2022, or else they disappear* TSLA shares closed at $1,033.42 on Friday, leading to a taxable gain of ~$23.5bn* We've already established he takes no cash salary, so his options are (a) forfeit ~$23bn in earned income and not sell shares or (b) exercise his options and finance the cash payment by liquidating a portion of his assets.....which is made up entirely of TSLA shares* this hot take also completely ignores the fact that he'll eventually have to exercise these options, creating a fuckton of trading volume which...let's be honest....will likely push their share price higherAnd let's address the alternative solution - Musk takes out a ***$23.5bn cash loan on TSLA's balance sheet*** which likely violates whatever debt covenants are in place right now (in addition to being a massive clusterfuck in terms of corporate governance). This would never happen in the real world. I get that it makes sense when you reason it out in the back of your head, but I think you're missing a ton of relevant information and pieces of the puzzle when it comes to Musk's tax obligation in relation to the publicly trade company he runs (and has a fiduciary duty towards...)
&gtI'm confident a bank would gladly give him a secured loan of 15B to one of the world's richest menThat bank would have to bet that Tesla stays high, given that Tesla is as volatile as it is, and since it makes up most of his net worth. A lot of banking divisions might not support that.A 15 billion liability secured by stock with an insanely high P/E might be acceptable for prop traders, not so much wealth management. I don't think he could get 1.5%, and he'll still net have more Tesla shares at the end of this, so I think this probably is the right thing for him to do while staying bullish on Tesla.
OP is a hugely insightful genius.  No one has ever thought Tesla was massively overvalued before.  an the CEO has never hinted that he thought it overvalued before.  If OP shorts the stock to capitalize on his incredible insight he will gain wealth beyond his wildest dreams.  But only if he margins his account and leverages that short as far as his broker will let him.
Tesla 1000P first thing the market opens
Why are you idiots still playing Tesla? Lmao
For a moment I was getting worried I didn't see any "Tesla is overvalued" post today! Thanks
You know that he literally tweeted out ["Tesla stock price is too high imo"](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-stock-price-is-too-high-shares-fall.html) over a year ago, right?That's not new information...
its not a bs excuse, look at how options work for execshe has options expiring. unless he has billions in cash on hand he HAS to sell to meet his tax burdenand yeah. tesla is overvalued. its been objectively overvalued even before its runup. so good luck timing your short/put position properly.
Then short it. Tesla being overvalued is not a new concept in this sub.
It can't sustain a growth rate of more than 50% CAGR for literal decades. Exponential growth requires exponential resources, which Tesla simply doesn't have because the Earth is rather finite and he's producing physical goods.  The company is also rather expensive, unlike a company like Monster which could more easily achieve the gains because they started out extremely small.The PEG with \*hugely\* inflated expectations is still overvalued. There isn't a single metric on the planet that could justify the $1k+ valuation right now, except for hype/speculation/low-interest rates. As soon as those things evaporate, Tesla will crash straight through the floor.Buying $100 bills for $500+ is ridiculous, I don't know why people like doing it in the stock market.
Lmao Elon is  just trying to unload when tesla is overpriced, and trying to pretend that politicians are asking him to. Literally no one asked him to. Sanders makes a generic post about taxes and Elon is like WAIT WAIT BERNIE YOU WANT ME TO SELL STOCK OK I GUESS YOU'VE TWISTED MY ARM"Fucking clown show, lmao. And if you're actually falling for Elons shitty little community theater here, you're a straight dumbass.
Elon selling at the top. He‚Äôs said repeatedly in interviews he doesn‚Äôt believe Tesla is worth its value but investors keep buying anyways. Cars aren‚Äôt exactly high margin products. 1 Trillion+ is such a ridiculous valuation even if Tesla sold a million cars a month
"In addition to a $20 million fine, and the removal of Musk from his post as chairman of Tesla, the SEC‚Äôs settlement dictated that any of his public communications that could impact the company‚Äôs stock had to be approved."Err... I think that tweet impacted the share price, hello SEC are you there, HELLO anybody home!https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2019/3/18/18271914/sec-elon-musk-contempt-twitter-court-fraud
Only if you don't sell right the fuck now. Tesla stocks are coming back to earth and Elon is relying on his army of dream chasers to hold his bags as he cashes out. He wants to make it look like it's the politicians fault for taxing him but it's not. Wealthy people need to be taxed because it's how a democracy should work. I'm worried he will be successful in militarizing his drone army
Tesla has a lot of potential in the long term as a company. That being said their current valuation is ludicrous, and there is no way that they can live up to the kind of returns that you would need to justify a 1 trillion market cap right now. Unfortunately we are living in a market that is dominated by low information investors, so we will have to wait until confidence levels drop before the bubble pops.
Infrastructure bill is also being signed tomorrow. That bill creates the groundwork for massive spending around electrified vehicles, both industrial and consumer.Of course Microvast is a play on the industrial specialty side. Port vehicles (see recent additional spending promised by the White House around port improvements), mining (increasing concern around sourcing materials domestically), trains, BUSSES, etc. There is still the potential USPS work with OSK.The spending and therefore demand is there and accelerating exponentially. There‚Äôs a lot of hate and FUD because this thing had a roller coaster ride as a SPAC and then got pumped by that Jack guy. It‚Äôs noise, there‚Äôs a market for this product and even everyone‚Äôs favorite Elon Muskrat just said cell production is a long term limit for Tesla (and all EV). They will sell out all production no matter what. That 800+ percent change in Institutional ownership should say everything you need to know. They bought this dip and likely plan to hold for years.In with 12,500 commons. üëä
Pete Davidson went from Ariana grande to a 41 year old ex porn star with 4 kids and people are still gassing him up.Man's trading on a higher P/E than Tesla.
Yay Tesla 600p then 700c
Closed all Tesla positions well in the green, burn it down so I can buy the bottom!
A Berner but I‚Äôm balls deep in Tesla. Mommy, Daddy please stop fighting. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4968)
Lol are you kidding? He manipulates the stock price of tesla. Thats wrong. Not sure what you arguing. You don't become a billionaire by being a good person, or generous, or anything. You get there by stepping on the heads of labor, taking their increased productivity and putting it in your pocket over paying them for their increased production. Hkm an bozos have made hundreds of billions of the last 2 years while many small businesses have gone out business. Amazon's business model is to steal the ideas of its drop shipper program to adopt sure fire products to sell under one of their Amazon brands. Elon panders to Twitter and manipulates the stock price. Heanipulates crypto, he creates margin and then capitalizes on price movement. Hes a scumbag just like bezos. They became wildly successful by fucking over a countless number of people. This isnt really hmdifficult to put this together lol
Tesla has in the past paid Musk in options. Some of those options, which were granted years ago, will expire next year and are, evidently, very very far in the money. So he will exercise them, increasing his ownership measured in shares but not changing the degree of exposure he has to Tesla stock. Which is why the comment I replied to is silly.
Like he said, he had options to cash out. By making it seem like he's 'selling his share' he both gets to look good to the Tesla bros and makes money.
Does Tesla still make cars or is it just a bunch of dudes free-basing DMT in a office campus in Texas?
I‚Äôm seriously considering getting a Rivian. And we have a MYLR. But Tesla customer service is just poor. Like Walmart level of don‚Äôt give a shit. Rivian headquarter is like 10 minutes from my house. Saw a few Rivian on the road already, probably just testing units. Doesn‚Äôt scream I need attention.
Stupidity runs strong with the tesla fan boys and musk worshippers. He can do no wrong. Used to love Elon but hes more interested in attention than anything.
Judging by technology trends and that Tesla applies the bad ones to their cars they will eventually add subscription activated vibrators to the seats.Elon is indirectly going to fuck the wives and girlfriends of guys who buy them. Probably going to end up fucking a lot of guys too.
Ya'll realise as Tesla stock rises, the probability of Elon tweeting something stupid goes up exponentially. It's why I sold my Tesla 2 weeks ago. I hope it goes down so I can buy it again at a bargain.
He's definitely expecting a pull-back and he has the money to wait for one even if it doesn't come immidiately. As soon as Tesla goes down, he'll put all the money right back and own more shares than when he sold. This is the only reason he's selling and he's using his media genius to spin this like a tax thing knowing most of his idiots will believe just that.
Definitely will have things to do with that money, but if he truly were bullish on tesla he would have found the way to pay taxes, exercise options and do anything else he wanted without having to sell
Yeah it‚Äôs time for him to shut his mouth. Rivian promises to have way less drama than Tesla.Musk has been able to get away with this because there hasn‚Äôt been competition.
Come on ElonDo it pussyI want some Tesla shares
All these Tesla holders literally funding Elon's pension.
Elon will own more shares of Tesla in 90 days than he did before this sell off.
Let‚Äôs go Tesla 600.
Tesla $1500 EOY just because this tweet
Yes bitch sell, you think we care? ( buys puts on Tesla)
Tesla puts Monday? Got it
You forgot to include where Elon said ["I keep forgetting that you're still alive"](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1459891238384115722)This is an easy slam dunk. Tank Tesla and/or shut Elon up for a while with a single tweet. Amazing things like this don't happen though.
Really? Tesla is more innovative than Google? More innovative than Intel? More innovative than Ford?
Ah, I remember posts like this about Tesla.  Wonder what happened to those guys
I've been in a Rivian, they are the real deal. The fit, finish, quality and drive is far, far superior to Tesla. And to answer your questions, yes to pretty much all of them. They have a production line, are building sellable units, building Amazon vans, they have batteries and the stole a bunch of Teslas employees because apparently Elon is an insufferable asshole.
They have the second largest holding of the automotive market trailing only GM. Tesla for example holds like 0.3% of the market, but is valued exponentially higher. It makes zero statistical sense.
Tesla will never hit $1k
Standard issue though. Tesla always pushes new models to their employees / insiders first.
Stocks are just names people throw money at to try to get rich. There's no reason to worry if the company does anything.  Pretty much the same as crypto. Oooooh a dog coin made my cousin Freddy a million dollars on 8 dollars invested, I'm going to yolo my life savings into shibu butt coin! There is actually no real reason for any of their price movements other than what people are betting will make them money and people taking profit. This stupid EV company will irrationally pump for like five years like Tesla probably because everyone saw people get rich with Tesla.
Love the Tesla bulls calling Rivian overvalued‚Ä¶. Haha
Can confirm. Tesla has infinitely more Elon Musks.
Tesla fanboys be like Rivian price is way too high and doesn‚Äôt reflect its sales. Lol probably same people that don‚Äôt understand what irony means.
**"Do they attract the world's best engineers?"**  Ok, this is kinda funny in an ironic sorta way.  You apparently are unaware that the majority of engineers on Rivian's team were recruited away from Tesla right? The reality is, it's an open secret in the industry that Tesla is a place to hold your nose and try to rack up stock options, then get out of the hellhole as quickly as possible. You are aware that Tesla's retention rate is worst in the industry, right? It's like a running joke. Apple's autonomous team also is mostly refugees who escaped. If you're unfamiliar, this extends well beyond the ranks of engineers. If you can find a Fortune 500 company that has had greater turnover in the C-suite, you deserve an award. Before you waste your time looking, don't. You won't find one because there isn't one. Tesla's C-suite turnover is unrivaled in corporate history.Now as to whether Rivian is a short this week, that's a different question. It's in la la land valuation-wise. But no way is it a short until the momentum and money flow gets exhausted. Whether that happens this week, you'll have to wait and watch the flows to find out.
You think you are to late for Tesla? Think again, and watch it in 2030.
Evergrande announces acquisition of Crown Casino, and have taken a 49% ownership of Tesla.
Tesla is a once in a lifetime company dude. I‚Äôd argue one of the sole reasons they went up is because Elon Musk. The man is an innovator, trolling, autistic weirdo that some people love. There‚Äôs no other billionaire that captures his charisma or ambition and that‚Äôs what really helped drive Tesla up. I don‚Äôt think Rivian gets anywhere near what Tesla has gotten to, but it isn‚Äôt my money to try so go for it.
Spacex is not Tesla. Full stop.
Tesla does not have space shuttles.
If you are a TSLA bull, I don‚Äôt get why you would short Rivian. Not saying rivian is Tesla‚Ä¶but you must see similarities in the hate Rivian is getting? I‚Äôm personally estimating 9b in revenue by the end of 2023. The Amazon order will be fulfilled by then and they should have sales to regular customers of not far off of 100,000 by then too. Tesla TTM revenue is 46b.
Issue is Tesla Stan‚Äôs feeling threatened they might be bag holding.Like ok, Rivn shouldn‚Äôt be 100b but Tesla shouldn‚Äôt be 1T either. Can‚Äôt have it both ways.
disclaimer: i'm a TSLA bullRivian is too high, but they have a production line, in the Mitsubishi factory in IL they bought years ago.Logistics?  Looks like they built a fleet-management system to win Amazon's love and $$$   https://rivian.com/fleetYou didn't mention charging network -- looks like they are building their own too.Truck looks much more fun than the Tesla CyberTruck https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1uYhkMRLWg - hopefully Tesla comes up with more body designs/options as they build out.I'm not shorting, but I might buy if it comes back to earth.
They have some MASSIVE partners. Better than Tesla or anyone had when they started. That is why the hype is so big. You have the biggest Tech/Shipping company and a giant car company heavily invested in you. I can't see their sharks not catching some glaring fuckery if there was any.....Another thing is....................the actual vehicle seems much better built than Tesla according to reviews. Especially early Teslas. The design is also very  unique, speed is down right bizarre for a truck so if they start delivering actual vehicles on decent timeline and these reviews keep coming from regular owners...............Still think stock is overpriced tho.
Shouldn't we get in on the upswing? Atleast until $1000/share or so? Like Tesla.I don't want to regret my life, again.
Omg if I hear one more person talk about how Rivian is overvalued based on any inherent value of the company itself. Have you not been paying attention? The stock is worth what someone will pay for it. What the company is actually worth based on its assets and earning potential has nothing to do with anything. See, Tesla. See also, magic digital beans that have massive market caps and no inherent value. And people will pay for it. Not only because they will compare it to Tesla, but also the excitement surrounding legit startup auto manufactures. For my entire lifetime, this has been an industry pretty much closed off to new players. With the advent of EV‚Äôs, that‚Äôs now possible, but only until that market matures, then who knows when we will see this happen again.
Stay away from it . Totally out of control , investment , it's currently not an investment ...it's a pig pile of people that think it's Tesla . No revs, no cars , no delivery but hey Amazon and Ford partnered so let bring up to 200 bill because why not. Not short, puts ,calls or long .watching from the sidelines and it looks like a mess .
Good point, if they can crack the top 50 automakers it will likly be a trillion dollar company.  By then Tesla will be in the top 20 biggest automakers and likely worth 5 trillion.  I can't believe how stupid Toyota is, they're hurting their valuation by selling cars and trucks to everyone.  That's worthless.  They need a product with potential that people can dream about, that's where the big money is.  Then automotive investors will value your company at what they think it might be worth in 50 years when you're selling more cars than all current automakers combined.
Currently in Tesla 725 11/19 puts
This makes Tesla look like a cheap value play.
This will be the new Tesla. Remember this post in 5 years
I believe it is a refundable deposit of $100, helped them get capital quickly and also secured someone‚Äôs spot in like. I think it is like Tesla where a few weeks out you finalize your spec of the vehicle then it goes into production and gets sent to you.
If you think your average middle class person can save 80% of their paycheck, you're lying to yourself. Average median income is 67k, saving 80% of that leaves you with 14k to live on. That's less than minimum wage. I also hope you know that if everyone with extra money lived frugally and saved it, no one would be buying anything and the economy would grind to a halt. How much would Tesla stock be worth if they sold 15 cars a year? Not everyone can be a millionaire, that's why some of us are capable of becoming millionaires. If everyone has a million dollars, then no one has a million dollars.
Look I believe in climate change , I want a Tesla , and I think anybody who still think that Coal is a reliable source of energy is a fucking idiot , but I‚Äôm getting really tired of these doomsday predictions about the worlds climate ,  they said that Miami was going to be underwater by 2020 lol
To be fair nvda is like 100 pe, disney is like 300 pe and tesla is at like 1500pe
You know how pornstars and strippers have names like ‚ÄúMercedes‚Äù? I wonder if they‚Äôll start naming themselves ‚ÄúTesla‚Äù in the next few years
Just because of this post, now Tesla will probably reach $10T valuation in 1 or 2 years. P.S. I‚Äôm a $NIO shareholder. üíéüôåüöÄ
&gt This is the money only investedTo be more specific, this is only the money that he's invested in Tesla. Chances are he has a diverse portfolio and has millions invested in other companies too.
If he keeps it in tesla for more than a year (which it sounds like he has done/plans on doing), then long term capital gains tax is 20% for the amount over 500K.Also, the highest tax rate is 37%. People love to round up to 40%.
Yeah if they announce any partnerships in regards to their racing tech or an announcement about their energy storage - this will blow up.I expect pretty flat / no big news. But I'm super bullish on Lucid and think anyone betting against them is like betting against Tesla. Too much momentum and backing.
Go outside and count all the non-Tesla EVs you see and report back
Yeah except normal people rely on that for retirement. They can‚Äôt yolo 200K on Tesla if that means they will work till they die if it goes south.
Wish i had a small loan of 2million bucks to turn into 7million bucks. Tesla is too expensive for me to get rich off now.
This fails to account for improvements in technology and automation that could affect production in existing factories in coming years.  It also fails to realize the much more important fact that Tesla is not just a car company.
Nah I used to work with a guy who decided to remortgage his house and threw it all on Tesla about two years ago. He didn‚Äôt tell me actual specifics but I gathered it was about a half mill or so when the price was about $50. Ballpark about 10k shares. Two years on that‚Äôs worth $20MI have no idea if/when he sold or how much, because I don‚Äôt work with him anymore. I still work. And he doesn‚Äôt. The fucker. Sometimes you just have to take massive risks and gamble your house.
Every time I look at Tesla I think I wouldn't mind being invested but their valuation is completely unrealistic and obviously a bubble.  Then I look at it again later and think about all the money I didn't make.
When Tesla dips I want my immediate unrealized tax refund
There's a lot of sketchy stuff Tesla does that gets no news coverage. There have been credible reports of accounting tricks like selling large numbers of cars to Norwegian entities before they're actually sold to customers (presumably to hit quarterly numbers). Another example is Carvana showing used Tesla Model 3s as being more valuable than the purchase price from Tesla. A Carvana exec went to school with Elon so they likely know each other. It makes zero financial sense for Carvana to do this, but it helps Tesla with inflating the value of used cars for accounting purposes.
Headlines tomorrow:**NEW TESLA MILLIONAIRE DUMPS STOCK, BUYS FORD. WHAT DOES HE KNOW?**
This is a sign. Sell all the Tesla stock and yolo it into Ford.
See now THIS can buy a Tesla. Or 20. Where‚Äôs that guy with like 15k gains? He‚Äôs need to see this
Can you buy my wife a Tesla also?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1uYhkMRLWg In case you haven't seen, the truck is actually pretty fucking badass. Obviously, there is a lot more to a stock valuation than the product being good, but from my perspective, if the engineers were able to put together a truck this solid with this many steps forward and nuance, then there's probably a really good corporate atmosphere and management system to allow for such a good product to be put together. The key obstacles looking forward would then be deliveries and their supply chain. They have had enough outside investment from partners like Amazon and Ford and took their time to bring their product to market, so I don't think they'll turn into Tesla with this. They also know their market very well, they have been a regular presence at overlanding expos for the past couple years. Another obstacle is the charging network, but with the F150 Lightning coming out soon and Ford's existing backing, I don't forsee this being an issue either. As a company, they're going to be a lot less problematic than Telsa as well. I expect a lot of outdoorsy west-coasters to empty their pockets to buy this e-truck. I dunno, I can't do a deep dive into the financials, but so far so good as a company bringing a product to market.
Buy her a Tesla for 12k
This. I‚Äôm waiting for the hype to die and we can buy at $30-$50 like Tesla once was. Then it‚Äôs a 10 year waiting game.
Lol so ford is overvalued at 78b market cap but Tesla at 1.1 trillion 370 pe isn‚Äôt?
&gt Tesla is going to keep going up. Not because of any charts or measurements but because of hype and optimism.Yes, that's what a bubble is.
üëÜüèºthis! I love Tesla and love making money!
Yea and now when your Tesla breaks you‚Äôre potentially fucked depending on where you live. And Tesla had been around for years and years before it‚Äôs growth started taking off.
We all like tesla.
But I like Tesla.
I think people are desperately wanting to back Original EV Companies more than the old guard companies.  It's why IMO Nikola scammed so well, it's how Lordstown motors exists, and it's just one reason why Tesla is over $1T. Rivian has some positives over Nikola and Lordstown and these would be the fact they did the years of stealth work to develop an 'adventure' EV and going by a lot of the press parade videos they possibly made a valid off roading EV pickup that can go up a hill under its own power as well as it does going down a hill. I do not think Lordstown, Tesla, Nikola, or any other EV startup will make (at production levels) an offroad 'adventure' focused EV truck within the next 6yrs. They've had a huge splash to begin but I suspect it will reset some and go on a more typical growth rate.
How do I know it's going to go down? Because I just bought Ford, just like I bought Tesla last week.
This guy has Tesla puts!
I just fucked a 45 yr old bitch who walks her little shitzu around my complex everyday. I go outside and she says hey, your the guy with the Tesla right? Hour later her feet are behind her head.I'm buying calls on Monday.
Ah shit Im gonna get banned tomorrow because I said Tesla would go to 1400. Big dumb
Rivian has a long way to go. My eternal question for these new car companies (not Tesla): if you bought a car from them in the next two years and had to get it fixed, where are you going to go? An entire infrastructure has to be built to support them and that is no small feat.
I played spy quite a bit, my first big break was tesla
The future is always priced into the current market cap. Look at Tesla. People are betting on the future of Rivian and they have a good shot.I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it dropped back down to the 60s where it‚Äôs likely correctly evaluated right now. I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it stayed around 100 for a while. You‚Äôd be surprised how overvalued things can get especially in the market nowadays.
O'lllllll reliable... Tesla calls xD
Great gains, man just need to double it a few more times.  Best laugh I had all week.  The title, the comments.Still an excellent week, buy tsla with those gains and get a Tesla in a few years
LMAO 12k for a Tesla üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Holy shit, is it 2010?No?Then what the actual fuck does fundamentals, leadership skills or anything else have to do with stock value?It's a casino now. GME, Tesla, doesn't matter. Stocks are so far out of whack with any useful metric that it's just insane mob rule. Market says fuck WISH, so wish takes dick balls deep in a manner unlikely to result in pregnancy. Pick a number and a color, make a bet. Quit trying to rationalize. We're not using that Stock Market anymore.
Only thing I don't like is that you didn't short Tesla, you bought puts. It's different man. Like at any point was your account short shares of Tesla that needed to be covered?
Homie is just gonna buy his wife 10 shares of Tesla. Eventually that'll buy her a real Tesla.
Translation: WOW you‚Äôre telling me Tesla wasn‚Äôt even considered??? They‚Äôre so far behind!
If you think lucid is overvalued go look at RIVIAN which is trading higher than Tesla did when Tesla was already mass producing and introduced the model S.
It‚Äôs a cubic zirconia Tesla
What are you basing these valuations on?Cause Doordash has made me pay $50 for a $20 meal, as far as I'm concerned that shit should be putting up Tesla numbers the way they rob their users
Ehh the boyfriend we be driving the Tesla, it all works out once you figure out financing
This. Tesla had$26bn in revenue when their valuation reached $100B, just sayin‚Äô
Buying her a Tesla with 12k gains makes you a simp. Get her a used Honda civic like a Chad.
Tesla is coming out with a matchbox series for $12k.Even has a collectible box for all 3 of them.
A Tesla costs more than 12k but congrats.
Well one day you will get one and her boyfriend is gonna be riding in the Tesla as well as in her! üòç
Bruh you should get your new tesla a wife
I think you mean you are buying your wife NEW TESLA stock for xmas-- then when it hits 3000 you can buy her a TESLA car.
Lol motortrend is more of a advertising company these days than covering car journalism. Not a Tesla fan foy but they all still seem to be missing the biggest appeal of Tesla -- Tesla charging infrastructure and how effective and seamless it is to use it. Electrify america still feels very startup ish.
.. perhaps because the Tesla Model S isn‚Äôt new and doesn‚Äôt qualify? It won COTY in 2013 so while I like lucid, this is a pretty terrible comparison
To put it into perspective how dumb this is, the year that Tesla started to deliver the Model S and had higher output than Rivian is even supposed to have, TSLA valuation was just under $4B. A lot of people are going to lose a lot of money real soon.
Sold my year Long Tesla positions, gonna wait a bit me buy a dip
Not Tesla, Elon Musk. And he doesn‚Äôt have a record of actually doing 99% of the bullshit he says he‚Äôll achieve with his companies each month.
Those of you who are mad at Elon for selling his ridiculously overvalued Tesla shares are the kind of people who hold meme stock shares all the way down to -75% so they can ‚Äústick it to the shorts.‚ÄùThe point is to make money. You think Elon gives a shit about your stupid options play?
5 upvote and i‚Äòm going to buy 30 tesla shares
&gtTesla and rivian are currently being valued as if they will be the only two car companies in the world in the next ten years.Exactly. Ford is right on their heels with a century of experience to help them along. The traditional car companies will likely eclipse the upstarts in time.
Agreed. Ford's leadership seems to be making all the right decisions, in a rational market they would be worth just as much if not more than Tesla, but that has more to do with Tesla being way overvalued than Ford being undervalued.
Investors horribly overvalue new revenue streams vs established ones, especially if they market themselves as "tech". Look at wework for a more extreme example. Tesla and rivian are currently being valued as if they will be the only two car companies in the world in the next ten years.
Stop buying Tesla. Jesus if it drops we get it on sale. Think about it.
(Elon Musk farts loudly)mainstream media: "Elon gassy? Gas? Gas-powered Teslas."(Tesla sells off)
Lol but Hey let‚Äôs buy Tesla at 1200 because Elon tweeted
‚ÄúAfter its first two days of trading in 2010, Tesla had a market cap of just more than $2 billion.‚Äù  Rivian is worth $100 billion after two days.
Let‚Äôs see a -20% Tesla day. That would make things interesting
Tesla 0dte $1100 strike today only $300 a contract. Seems reasonable
yeah if tesla could just go up to 1300 today that would be great, thanks
comparing tesla to amc is the most stupid thing i saw today.
Fuck Tesla . Piece of shit stock. (Please spike today so I can get out of my 1tde calls at -70% down) üôè
TSLA is the new AAPL - or at least that's the closest comparison.No one made much money making phones before Apple.  We could see the same disruption with Tesla.Anyway, AAPL did very well through the dot com era.  I'm expecting similar execution from TSLA.
As a boomer who was there in the middle the original dot-com frenzy, I believe you are right. But everyone already knows this. So why is it happening again? Of the thousands of dot-coms that were "going to change the world", only a scant handful actually did. Amazon and Google, for instance. Anyone remember Geocities? It was the amazing new social media game-changer, until it got trounced by MySpace, who succumbed to Tumbler's short lived heyday until Facebook owned the world. Yahoo, Infoseek, AskJeeves, etc. were all in the game way ahead of Google. What's my point? Everyone thinks Tesla is the new Google (or Amazon), but from my perspective on history, it looks a lot more like the earlier days, when Yahoo was the golden child waiting for Google to come along and eat its lunch. Tesla is more like Yahoo was than what Google is. A lot of people seem to think Rivian is going to do the Google thing to Tesla. But they are all wrong. Flooz failed to take-down PayPal partly because everyone expected it to, including their own leadership. That's a poisonous attitude. Also, cars are not the Internet. This game is different. My money is on the charge-point suppliers. As long as it takes batteries an hour or so to recharge, every restaurant, movie theater, shopping center, etc. will want to have chargers installed as a draw to attract customers. I'm also invested in battery tech that \*could\* create those "charge in under a minute" batteries, just in case, but I'm skeptical on those.  When you consider that recharging a 35 kWh battery in one minute requires more than *two-million* watts of energy...  There's a safety issue with that. (Level-2 charging is about 7000 watts. Household current in the US is typically 1600 watts...)
wait till they merge with Tesla and you can exercise in your autonomous electrical vehicle
There are good people on here.  Take profits if you own some Tesla, AMC, GME.  Keep playing the casino, SPY could have one last gasp, but the insider selling has been ramping up and up this Fall, especially the last month.  We‚Äôre in end stage of this bubble.  It‚Äôs beyond obvious.  Trade smart and I wish everyone the best

Why buy Tesla now when you can buy in at $1400 in a few days
People that missed on Tesla are on FOMO highwayüòÇ
except Tesla makes 250k cars per quarter, with 2 new factories about to come online that will 2-3X that....with seemingly unlimited demand for their products.  As well as an energy business that is about to open up the most extensive super charger network to resell power(at higher rates) to the entire EV market.
People that said tesla is overvalued will be fuming because rivian is at least x2 more overvalued compared to tesla fundamentally
And tesla is?
I think the bigger question is why did Tesla add a Disney in market cap for a $4B in revenue deal.  And even that is debateable.  If they are truly supply limited then why would selling to Hertz excite investors at all?
&gt Elon Musk is a fraud. Tesla will collapse in the next few years, and he knows it.
Hype.  Rivian has it.  Polestar doesn‚Äôt.  Not yet anyhow.  Tesla has tons of it.
Compared to Tesla it looks like a steal.
1.) My post doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with me knowing anything about DCF. See the part were I reference ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù not necessarily  myself. Personally I don‚Äôt trade Tesla at all, not my area of expertise. Reading Comp class might benefit you my friend. 2.) I personally don‚Äôt care about pricing models. If you wanna be the worlds best price tagger go work at target. You‚Äôd be dope there. We apes  are here to do one thing, and one thing only, and that‚Äôs make fat tendies. So I find it ironic, that for years I‚Äôve seen people do deep dd which I imagine takes them days sometimes even weeks just to be consistently wrong not for months but years. And to make matters worse they are getting beat by apes who imagine see Tesla on Robinhood and go ‚Äústock go brrr‚Äù.3.) at the end of the day, they say money talks, and for us that‚Äôs results. And lately all I‚Äôve seen is Tesla boys (who are not doing this epic DCF modeling) posting fatter gains than tes holiday, so it is what it is my friend. U know, no hate just saying
I think the difference here is that Tesla is being priced as though they have already accomplished all of those things.  Apple wasn‚Äôt a trillion dollar iPod company.
Sometimes I wonder how it feels to do all this reading and dd and shit just to get outperformed by multiple hundred % by someone who just goes Tesla FDs print brrrrrr! It can‚Äôt feel good I imagine.
Counterpoint, legacy auto has A LOT of debt and obligations (e.g. pensions) and are not in a growth phase. Plus Rivian (and tesla) can make a car for less than legacy auto ICE partially because they're much simpler to make.  I won't find it easily, but if you do some basic accounting, they're  not so absurdly priced with some reasonable assumptions of vehicle sales in the mid term. Additionally they are likely to produce other revenue mechanisms that Ford hasn't.
EV stocks are in a massive bubble, who knows how far it will go. Rivian is extremely overvalued for what they offer you‚Äôre not getting in early, the early investors obviously making a killingPersonally I‚Äôm not in a hurry with rivian, I‚Äôm ok to wait a long time for the stock to crash or miss out on it. I hold Tesla since a long time and happy with it
$571, but using a very optimistic 10 million cars in 2032 and other criteria.  Tesla is losing  mkt share fast in the more mature EV markets globally as competing models arrive weekly.  Just 14.5% of global EV sales at present.
So the current valuation is pricing in a perfect future for Tesla.  And then multiplying that by two.
Kill tesla tomorrow
Actually, unless I‚Äôm reading it wrong, I think that‚Äôs the valuation he gets at assuming the very rosy scenario he paints, one of Tesla achieving all their growth goals, staving off competition, etc.
Buffet sees a world where Tesla is worth 50+% more than Berkshire and thinks there will be tasty opportunities soon.
saw a "TESLA MOBILE SERVICE VEHICLE" on the freeway this morning.  read "FORD" on the dead center of the rear.  c'mon elon!
Google "three fund portfolio".  A link from bogleheads.org should be near the top.  That strategy works probably up to 10 million or more in assets.Theres no reason to pay a financial advisor 1% a year (will take like 30%+ of your money by the time you retire).  BUT if you arent disciplined enough to tune out financial news and FOMO for things like bitcoin and Tesla then an advisor might be better.
Outstanding!! I‚Äôm not a Tesla bull or bear. I have no dog in this either way. As an observer I am relieved to see some rationality and light being shown on a stock that is more of a phenomenon than anything else in my opinion. I am grateful for the disruption Tesla has wrought and happy too see such a transformative company succeed but I am wary of the hyper valuations being established by it and a couple other  young ‚Äútech‚Äù stocks. Thank you for posting this.
Demand doesn't matter for any of these companies, supply is their issue. Tesla is the only one who has shown they can keep increasing supply while keeping costs down and become profitable.Ford making only 15k lightning trucks next year doesn't mean shit.Rivian is only forecasting 1M units by 2030. So they won't even be able to make a lot by then. When Tesla is at that rate today...
If I had enough for a Tesla or a rivian I would use it as a down payment for a Taycan.
Then we can grab Tesla by it‚Äôs pussy
Because the higher Tesla goes the more they make off those options...? It may be shocking but ultra wealthy people aren‚Äôt completely retarded like us and actually understand that making less money to have less taxes is stupid as fuck and makes zero sense
Lucid air doesn't look like a corolla for one and looks better than a tesla model S. I am buying more lucid tomorrow. Thanks for awesome dd.
Rivan already more valuable then every other car company but Tesla tf
ELON IF YOU CAN HERE ME I WILL NEVER BUY A TESLA UNLESS TSLA HITS $1250 TOMORROW YOU DINGUS
Call me a gay bear but i'm gonna short tesla and drink som bull blood
If Tesla closes below 1000 tomorrow, I will send a lucky winner who upvotes and comments on this post $100.
Being in uranium now is like being in Tesla at 200. IMO, not financial advice.
and then she sold Tesla before the run-up to buy snapchat, twitter and zillow... and then sold zillow the next day lol(still has 10% in Tesla, even though she got rid of her 10% rule 6+ months ago)
Can Tesla start to get pumped again. It was actually fun making money for once.
This entire group believes she's a genius because she bought tesla
Come on Tesla, drop below $1,000 you overrated piece of shit
But you are buying Tesla, right?
Psfe looks like a long hold dip just purely on the speculation and popularity. I dont know jack shit about the company, but popularity brings about big valuation premiums. If Shibashit and Dogecrap can get to 50 Bil, Tesla to 1200 Bil, why cant a digital fintech get to 10 bil?
Wrong conclusion from this event. Elon is selling only 10% of his huge pile of shares to pay taxes on his gains from exercising options which give him MORE shares. He's not any less all-in on tesla.
You know Tesla puts/calls both wrecked when everyone quiet
Liquidating Tesla to buy GameStop, that‚Äôs what I call a deep fucking value play
We have literally seen this exact same argument at least a dozen times with Tesla, yet it continues to devestate short sellers. Even the smartest Tesla bears are folding their cards, why raise yours?
Tesla puts anyone?
Meanwhile $Wish is up 6% today. Are we here to blame and make fun of people or to make some money? It seems that everybody is a great analyst looking at past results though. It's easy to say "doh you said Tesla was overvalued at $500". Let's not forget that investment is about the future.
His housing market bubble position was about 2 years old and everyone called him a retard until things went tits up.The airtime/exposure Burry gets is annoying, but insufferable WSBtards always omit the context in which Burry made his claim to fame. He was VERY early, but adamant on his position. All of the people in these threads dogging him sound exactly like his colleagues did in 2007.And anyone with half a fucking brain knows Tesla isn't worth their market cap to begin with.
All my ‚Äúsouthern lumberjack‚Äù friends who aren‚Äôt a fan of Tesla are all basically waiting for the Ford EV truck and when it hits will be dumping snapping em up even if they are 75k.Ford will probably end up becoming the closest thing to a competitor Tesla will see over the next 3 years
Anyone else bought dirtcheap Tesla calls in last 3  days? Looks like its about to print. üôèüôèüôèüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Tesla about to drag SPY up 1.5% today.
The spy dip might just be over. The bottoms in. Same for tesla.
He did bet last time against Tesla and lost money, his recents put were not closed and he even bought more in the quarter where the reversal did happen and the stock started its bullish trend, the news that he close came after Tesla was already past 800, don't know how you burry fanboy manage to believe he made money while all indicator shows that it was a bet that he lost
So everyone likes Tesla and Elon again now right? Just until the next time he completely fucks everyone? ü•¥üëç
He didn't make $110k. He only makes that amount if Tesla is above 2000 by 1/24. Maximum loss is $90k if tesla is bankrupt by then. Maximum profit is $110k if tesla is above $2k by then.Neither of that is not going to happen. His profit will be 110k-(2k-price of tesla). So, if price of tesla is 1500 at 1/24, he will have made a profit of $60k. If price of tesla is $900, he would make $0. If price of tesla is $100, he will lose $80k.
Tesla TSLA Tesla TSLA Tesla TSLA
It's Tesla, that's what Tesla does
Tesla stock is a gigantic bubble. A company selling so few items to a super select group of people is one of the largest companies in the world according to stock valuation? How?
We‚Äôve definitely seen some maximum autist Tesla videos in here.
I mean you did to yourself, who in their right minds would buy tesla atm? You are asking for it
Welp my Tesla puts are now kakak
Sold my tesla fds for a 13k loss. Looks like they would've opened profitable. I'm broken. I hate my life.
Tesla is a $1T+ market cap stock. Retail doesn't have even almost enough money to prevent a Tesla crash.Anyone who thinks Tesla is a retail stock story has been misled. Tesla is where it is because big money rode retail sentiment and bubbled the stock, but most of the money is big money, not retail.If big money decides its over, it's over. And retail will be holding the bags as usual.
Naaaaaaah burry is right on this one. Tesla has a long way down to go before its even almost a rational investment.
Because the only reason it fell in price was because people panicked that he was selling. Now that the dust has settled, it‚Äôs clear that him selling did very little to the stock price. Bro, I don‚Äôt care what Tesla is valued at. All I care about is trying to make money on it. If you don‚Äôt agree that it will go back to 1200, then you can buy all the outs you want.
OP got paid $110K in premium to contractually agree to buy 100 Tesla shares at $2K each for a total of $200K by Jan 2024. If Tesla's share price goes below $900 OP will be in the RED for this bet. Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong.
i think tesla will drop 50% not %90. Its a bubble but its a bubble with conviction and a cult following.
He is probably right... not because of "fundamentals" or any garbage like that... but because today was the day I finally jumped on board the tesla train. I not only wouldn't be surprised if the stock plunged 90%. I'm basically expecting it. Buy high sell low right? I'm the best at that
I bought Tesla puts today
Some ape said Elon would be selling $30b worth of Tesla to pay the tax on picking up $170b worth of Tesla.  Something like that.Anyhow, net outcome is Elon is about to own a higher % of the company.
I should have stuck with my Tesla short position longer.
Yeah, I'll believe the Apple EV when I see it. If Dyson couldn't bring a car to market with all the mechanical engineering and experience in electric motors they have, then what the fuck is Tim Cook gonna do? I mean, we're like what... a decade into the "Tesla killer" territory? It was supposed to be Fisker. It was supposed to be Faraday Future. Polestar, Volkswagen, Audi, Stellantis, the whole fucking Chinese EV sector... How many contenders will there be?At this point it's what? Nio, which are basically shitty Tesla rip-offs and Lucid, which is a low-volume, turbo-expensive luxury limousine? This is the best that the competition has? They're competing against years old battery and architecture tech and they still can't get a foothold. Once the structural battery Teslas start rolling out then the gap will just widen yet again. Not to mention the yawning software gap.What the fuck is Tim Cook gonna come up with? Does he have solid state batteries hiding in his fucking basement somewhere? Or maybe electric motors more efficient than the ones made by Tesla and Dyson? Get that bullshit out of here. Fucking Apple EV. What a load of crock.
You bought puts and thought Tesla would crash?
I thought Ford was a great option and was seriously considering buying Leaps in it pre Mach-e release on the back of that and the new very competent CEO. Tesla is Tesla, its a combination of gamma squeezes, fan boys, first mover advantage and Elon‚Äôs loose fingers but no reasonable person should believe Tesla is worth more than all the other car makers combined.
Sold them, and during the time he held them, its very, very likely it was a profitable trade.  He ran them during the time Tesla bounced downward this year, then didn‚Äôt have them in the filing shortly thereafter.
If this was a normal, pre retail investor, pre social media sentiment market I could easily see him being right. Tesla around 150 or whatever would make logical sense when it comes to the fundamentals. The fact is thoough, the retail support, strong sentiment and cult like social media element makes this pretty much impossible imo. Tesla will never fall that much in this era.
Yeah I still think Tesla is like the Microsoft story of 1999-2000. Great company. Great tech. Disruptive technology. Change the world. 20 years of growth already priced in and when the market realizes it, the stock will drop 50% and not reach ATH for another 15 years, making the shareholders bag holders.Just because it‚Äôs a great company with great technology that changes the world, doesn‚Äôt mean the stock price is right.That said, I‚Äôm not shorting it. I‚Äôve seen what happens. I see these cultists out here with their stimulus checks and their $15 an hour Wendy‚Äôs checks paying no rent in their wife‚Äôs boyfriends house. I‚Äôm not playing that game. I‚Äôm not a gay bear.But that said, good luck with this $2000 Tesla price you think is coming or whatever. Hope you do get rich, really. But I‚Äôm too old not to see the Microsoft all over this stock.
well, that isn't the same as "only evs on the street by 2035"...there will be plenty of gas powered cars still on the road.and, we will see if that legislation holds up or is delayed. i really doubt that enough infrastructure will be in place by then, I'm not even sure what kind of EV will be around then either (battery powered like a tesla? or...fuel cell? i would hope fuel cells as it will be a far faster refill process than waiting 15, 20, 30 minutes.  plus, batteries in the cold sucks and really dings range of an ev...)
Red Alert Tesla Coil Tanks were a thing )&amp#x200Bedit: https://cnc.fandom.com/wiki/Tesla\_tank\_(Red\_Alert\_3)
Did you say Tesla is making electric tanks?
You mean the only hedge fund manager to profit off betting agaist Tesla?
Not sure what could tank Tesla at this point.
Lol how many times has he deactivated his Cassandra Twitter account? He crawled out of his cave to say Tesla should drop 90% more
So he sold ~1/10 of what he plans. Stock went down 12% the day he did. 10x12=120%. I'm bad at math but I'll sign up for getting paid to take Tesla shares
Sounds like someone has some puts on Tesla that are about to expire.
Yall thought TESLA was gonna die? Bers r fuk! Lube it up tonight üåàüêª
All we need is Elon creating a tweet poll for Tesla split tomorrow
Tesla goes to 1200 or above tomorrow I'll get a cybertruck tattoo this weekend
&gt Yesterday, Elon Musk sold $10 million worth of Tesla stock. That's a bullish sign for his company and the market as a whole
Tomorrow tesla fomo going to be fuckinh insane
Uhhh why is Tesla mooning after hours ?
Tesla open 1200?
Bear is trapped. Tesla is already about to hit $1100 again and its going to finish above $1200 end of next week. Bear is trapped.
Playing Tesla is like robbing a gas station.Get in, get out, and don't fall in love in between.

If I learned anything from trading Tesla it is to not hold that shit. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have put or calls, after you make your money GTFO.
Wait so Tesla puts are fucked‚Ä¶.?!
I say it all the time but i have to say it againTesla bears ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
Tesla bears in fucking shambles
I‚Äôm actually happy Tesla is untouchable like that. I don‚Äôt hold Tesla or trade it ever but I will say there something special about it. Whole market poops on itself weekend poll potential sell off takes place and then a TeslaShapped chart occurs on the day. Fucking big balls.
Imagine not buying monthlies on that sub 1000 tesla dip ü§°ü§°ü§°
If Tesla was delisted the market would be more stable and profitable
My Tesla put is big fuk lmao

Had to check the chart. Ouch. Looks like my 11/26 1250c yesterday.I told myself I was never going to play TSLA options again because I‚Äôve NEVER made money with Tesla, and yet, here we are.
Not gonna be able to sleep holding Tesla calls overnight.
and then additionally, the Gov't can just replace all govt vehicles with tesla cars and trucks and drive sales. It's a win, win, win
Since tesla has a p/e&gt100 then buying stock and cars is free money. It literally cannot go tits up.
Tesla Chain Saw Massacre 2
ill take my loss on tesla puts like a man. This stock is just hilarious, not your regular apes pumping this thing from +/-0% to +6% in 30 minutes
Yo what the actual fuck. How did Tesla do this today? How was that even possible on a trillion dollar fucking company?
Everybody know tesla should cost $50
I‚Äôve never heard him say anything besides (invest in growth stock mutual funds).  He‚Äôs never recommended a specific stock from my experience. He‚Äôs recommended not investing in certain areas (not the F fund for TSP).  But as far as I see.  No conflict of interest.  He‚Äôs not saying ‚Äúgo buy Tesla‚Äù.
Puts on Tesla. Duh.
I sold my tesla calls at a loss and bought puts. Then it pumped passed where my calls broke even. I'm now down about 13k this week. I hate myself. I hate my life.
\*Tesla shareholders leaving the room\*
Yeah the $5T of cryptos, tesla, and meme stonks that are probably overvalued by 90% are more of a concern.
Correction is when tesla price drops below $800
tesla still green lmao
rivian: we're the tesla of nikolas.
Except that Rivian has no proprietary self-driving nor manufacturing infrastructure.  People are acting like it will be the next Tesla without considering all of the reasons that Tesla speculation is so high.
Next time when anyone says Tesla is overpriced, I‚Äôll show them Rivian. üòÇ
300 Billion?  That's how much value Tesla materialized out of thin air 2 weeks ago.  People really thing one company hits the skids in China is gonna tank the global economy?

Rivian early buyers going to take profit and rotate into tesla
It‚Äôll take Rivian about 10 years to get where Tesla is now (not to mention where Tesla will be by then) . It‚Äôs more of a lucid and other startup competition.
I pulled a cool $6000 profit today with some quick flipped calls. Who knew that "Tesla plummeting into the Earth" could be so profitable for the bulls? :\^)
Made 6 figure in stock gambling alone this year and im having my fiance cut my hair, while I search online for a pirate stream to watch anime on. Meanwhile my buddy barely making 45k has new magic cards coming in the mail every day and has a down-payment on the tesla truck.
Rivian not gonna beat tesla
And somehow peoples think I will spend $200 a month on a Self Driving mode for my tesla too. If I had infinite money, I wouldn't be driving a model 3.
The Gov't should just buy $5000 - Tesla Calls and pump a few trillion into the EV infrastructure market.  Problem solved.  You're Welcome
Tesla delivered 260k cars last year.  Market cap 1TFord + GM delivered 11 million cars last year. Combined market cap 170 BRivian delivered like 40 cars so far.  Wants IPO to give them +100B market cap.   ü§°
and people say Tesla is grossly overvalued lol
How many cars has Rivian made?  42? Valued at 100 billion Tesla makes 600,000 a year? Valued at 1 trillion. Production numbers means tesla is undervalued needs to be at least 10 trillion.
Everyone wants to get in early on the "next Tesla"
Tesla doesn‚Äôt have auto pilot or full self driving either.Tesla is just making the same licensed battery tech as they have been.Tesla doesn‚Äôt have a very good reputation for their repair services.Rivian already has 3500 L3 sites selected with leases/property secured. The IPO capital is being split up to build the charging network and start up the battery manufacturing.Yes they are IPOing before they have the same capabilities as Tesla - but they have significantly less headwinds to catching up then Tesla had blazing the path.
All these bears talkin about $TSLA going to 950 today buying $rope rnUp 300% on calls rn keep going tesla üôå
Rip to the guy who posted yesterday that he lost 26k on Tesla calls in the last two days and then bought puts yesterday before close with the rest of his balance. You really had the worst timing ever
When there is blood in the streets, invest in Tesla
Tesla is now making more bears homeless then global warming
Tesla 1200 eow back on the table?
Lmao...RIP the guy who lost 10k on tesla calls and decided to yolo his entire portfolio in tesla puts.
Bro Tesla is the scariest stock in the world
This \^\^\^ Tesla did all the heavy lifting.Now these guys can learn from that and ride the coat tails of the climate change fashion.
Tesla dipping to three digits today baby
Plz Elon tweet that the Tesla bot will also be a sexbot. Plz
I like Rivian and their truck looks great. I've watched a few reviews and some of the features it has are awesome.But there's no escaping how insane their valuation is. In relative terms it's even more crazy than Teslas in that Tesla was delivering over 360,000 vehicles by the time it got to a $70bn valuation (and that was in 2019, the company had been going for over a decade). Rivian has that valuation before it's even started proper customer deliveries.Then again, the markets around EV has changed a lot in the last two years, the hype is just ridiculous so we could easily see the share price of Rivian skyrocket on IPO really just on hype and future speculation.
I could single handedly end this pullback by buying a Spy or Tesla put
Tesla 750 EOD
Post nut clarity hits. Its clear Tesla calls is the play
Congrats to anyone that held TESLA puts ,My god.
Are we shorting Tesla to under 980
If tesla go below 1k, it will be 900. Bounce to 950
Imagine being the guy who said tesla was done √∑20 ago
Wont buy tesla till its at least $1300.
I'm so happy Tesla will finally die Thank you RIVN and F
And Tesla even after Elon tweeted the poll üòÇ
I will buy tesla stock at around 500 Usd
Burry claiming bull market is over and tesla is overvaluedHes really hyped in twitter that his $700 strike puts are now only down 98% instead of 99%
Mfers actually arguing with me that DASH deserves its valuation because ‚ÄúlOoK aT tEsLa‚Äù lol
**Tesla is up 1 grain of rice in North Korea**
Tesla back to 1.2k tomorrow?
Tesla will hit $1,000 support, then rocket to $1,500 next week
If you think about it‚Ä¶ Tesla is worth 1 trillion dollars with not a single cent spent on advertising. Elon garners more attention shitposting on twitter then any tesla commercial ever would. BULLISH AS FUCK.
*coughs Tesla cough*
There was a lot of rebalancing today because tesla was on sale. By the first of december, paypal will make a comeback heading into the end of year. Can‚Äôt predict what it will do tomorrow.
Musk created tesla the company as it is today, but got the name form an existing EV business that was going to go nowhere on its own.Basically any one part of the pre-musk tesla that was worth anything stuck around while the MBAs all got the boot.It is splitting of hairs to claim he didn't found tesla just because he grabbed the name from an existing going no where EV company venture.
The year is 2342. Tesla is the world‚Äôs largest company at a 420.69 Trillion dollar market cap. Tesla developed and perfected anti aging technology but this happened shortly after Elon passed away in 2057. Its run by his kid named xae 12 or whatever the fuck, still to this day. Anyways, PLTR is finally crossing that $30 Share Price mark for the second time since 2021.
if Tesla sucks so much , why don't you short it?
I own Tesla stock and Nio options. I‚Äôm fucked tomorrow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
Burry just posted saying he thinks tesla can drop 80-90%.  Then he deleted it.  I wish he would stop deleting
Has everyone forgotten that Elon also has SpaceX? He couldn‚Äôt give a shit about Tesla‚Äôs share price. Elon‚Äôs brother, Kimbal, sold $109 million in Tesla shares while Elon was *asking* Twitter plebs about his own shares. This is a dog and pony shit show.
Holy. Put values went up like 500%. Nice job lolRip to those Tesla calls tho.
You know what Johnny Cash once said...... You can run on for a long time, but sooner or later, Elon Musk will tweet that he's selling his Tesla shares while you're holding calls.
Imagine if you just bought tesla
He just wants to get Tesla as cheap as people like yourself with intellect did..
&gt Yes, Tesla will go down to 3 digits tomorrow.
yeah but the guy in charge of tesla literally has autism so its price to earnings/market share being autistic actually makes perfect sense if you think about itit took me 7 months to come up with that dd
I love all the people saying how over valued Rivian is but didn't mind paying $1100 a.share for Tesla...Classic.
Big day for Tesla again tomorrow If it hits 900 I‚Äôm buying 1200c several weeks out
Thankyou. People always spouting the "HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY FOUND TESLA" as if it's some *aha gotchu there*. Everyone knows it.But the fact is, without Elon, Tesla would never be where it is today.
Logically this is overvalued at 70B. However, I think everyone who missed on Tesla will fomo into this. So I think it will go up even though it shouldn‚Äôt but at the same time everyone knows it‚Äôs gonna dump as soon as insiders offload their shares.
Solar power, nuclear futures, and Electric VehiclesAlthough with EV you're probably a bit late to the party because Tesla was near its 52 week high of 4 times the price of the low and the US Congress announced its infrastructure deal would pass with a 7.5Bn EV investment a few days ago.Another thing that is quickly expanding is new encryption for low memory devices such as wirelessly connected microcontrollers in industrial use.Graphene Supercapacitors are taking off but Tesla absorbed one of the big names here in the USA, over in the EU there is Skeleton Technologies but it is not publicly traded yet.Hydrogen and Hydrogen Steel production are both very profitable growing industries right now.Can't go wrong with GME.Weed is defeating expectations in long term industry growth despite some notable firms operating at a quarterly loss consistently.**Industries to Avoid:**Coal is dead until western countries can adopt the new higher temperature "ultra-supercritical" technology to raise efficiency, which is unlikely.Ocean Fishing can no longer compete with vat raised fish both ethically and economically.Gas/Oil have lost public interest and only companies investing in a broad mixture of power sources are still staying afloat from quarter to quarter.Lab Grown Meat is a gamble until regulatory bodies can catch up to the scientific advances that made it possible.Bioplastics and desalination plants continue to disappoint in terms of profitability.**Maybe**:Agriculture could honestly go either way as the overhead and startup costs of indoor farming are still too high, but their yields are much more consistent and space efficient than fields which are constantly being decimated by bad weather.Silicon and Silicon Products are expanding!  However... where they will expand to fill the gap for the world's demand first is a gamble...  Maybe invest in all of them or none of them.
Fun fact: Elon Musk didn‚Äôt create Tesla. I read this a couple of weeks ago. And, I'm iffy on the facts but essentially what I read was that Musk bought the company and essentially by lawsuit against the real creators, is allowed to call himself a creator. Granted, he obviously has built the company to what it is today but‚Ä¶ he did not actually create Tesla.
Just get it on your finger, so you can have a Tesla mustache like all the hipsters.
I was downvoted to oblivion when I bought Tesla puts Thursday. Fuck y‚Äôall
IMAGINE BUYING TESLA OVER 1200 LMAOOO ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
Where's the guy with the constant Tesla huge bear position posts that sold at a loss like three days ago? I need to see that dumpster fire in action.
Elon's Tesla just returned from Mars. Report says DoorDash is already servicing the area
Tesla falls and stops exactly at the 50day and dude buys puts.
People were wetting their jockies over the *idea* that Tesla could hit 1200 six months ago and it finally did and everyone held anyway ...It's called a price target ... Make it. Stick to it.
I'm starting to think Cathie Wood has no clue what she is doing and just got lucky on Tesla.

Musk knew that money was moving from Tesla to rivian so he got ahead of it by creating the sale narrative instead of the losing market share narrative
TESLA BAGHOLDERS UNITE!
Tesla and peleton
I shorted tesla monday and im proud to say i made a dollar doing it.
You are missing the point.  Most people use SP500 over long periods of time in comparison to fund managers or as a proxy for the market.  However, the companies in the SP500 constantly change.  Its just a measure of the front runners at this moment in terms of value-the current most successful companies in the US.  &amp#x200BHis point is that if you just picked the funds from the SP500 in 1970 and never rebalanced or changed companies, your biggest companies by market cap would by GM, XOM, Ford, GE, IBM, Chrysler, Mobil, Texaco, ITT industries, Gulf Oil, ATT, and US Steel.  &amp#x200BCompare that to the current top 12: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet Class A, Alphabet class C, Meta(Facebook), NVIDIA, BKB, JP Morgan, United Health, Johnson and Johnson. &amp#x200BBy constantly reweighting stocks and dropping things out, SP500 is just keeping you invested in the bullies (or big stacks at the table) at any one moment.  The fact that this strategy is better than anything else over long time periods just points to the monopoly power and political power that big US companies get once they get really big.
It's because Tesla bros don't know the difference
TSLA bears are so cute. Tesla makes $20,000 in profit on every "cheap" car they sell. And they're vertically integrated the way no other carmaker is, plus their growing energy and utility business.  The only downside of owning TSLA is that Elon's tweets can instantaneously wipe out 20% of your stock value.
Thanks for reminding me I'm not *actually* a retard, holy fuck.Obviously you just need to take another loan, I bet you can find one for like 2k with 400% APR or some shit, yolo that motherfucker too and pay them both off with your tendies.That or start selling your organs.For real though you could always donate plasma until it's paid off and be forever reminded of this terrible decision every time you look at the junkie-esque hole in your arm. Then keep yoloing your blood money on tesla FD's or something, idk I'm just a degenerate gambler like you but nobody would give me a ten thousand dollar loan so, winning!
I dont see enough Tesla loss porns. I am sure 50% of you retards must have held those 1300C until now.
 Tesla $1200 11/26  call secured
Congrats and fuck you. These Tesla bulls were feelin too good after the stock didn‚Äôt tank yesterday.
Calling Tesla's approach "very hard" is a colossal understatement. Whether they realize it or not, their approach won't work without geofencing/mapping unless they manage to create the world's first general AI. There are thousands upon thousands of non-standard roads and intersections in the US alone, and vision-only will always have hangups due to optical illusions or difficult lighting conditions. Either their software needs to be able to independently figure out anything weird it sees, or it needs to be geofenced to areas where it's known that their software performs correctly.I dabbled in control system programming in school, including a small model car that used optical sensors to drive within lines on a model road. Initially it's natural to think that eliminating edge cases from these types of systems is like eliminating bugs from an otherwise finished piece of software. This is not the case continually eliminating edge cases takes an exponential amount of new code, instrument upgrades, full system redesigns, etc.At this point I'm convinced the entire industry has hit a brick wall at level 2, or geofenced level 3, or very strict geofenced "on rails" level 4. No amount of  additional instruments, test data, redesigns, or new startups is pushing the technology significantly forward. Tesla only gives the impression they are somehow leading the industry because they are willing to prematurely launch driving features to the public. If regulators continue to signal that they're not going to step in and regulate Autopilot/FSD, then you can expect Ford/GM to release similar products in the future.

I believe in you. I really do. Elon to the fucking moon. Tesla is the future. People who don‚Äôt see that are clinging onto the past because they lack vision. I wish you the absolute best of luck!
Don‚Äôt worry Tesla you pump when you feel like it
No, i mean you can swap Tesla for literally anything and still will be true
"I'm not saying Tesla will do that.I am saying it can"Only bold statements lmao
Just woke upTesla lmao
F is like Tesla except that the ceo doesn‚Äôt tank the stock on purpose
"Current and former board members including board chair Robyn Denholm,¬†Elon Musk's brother Kimbal Musk,¬†Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias¬†have also offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Tesla shares since Oct. 28."
This is not financial advice, because I'm a complete moron.Rivian's IPO is probably overvalued for the next few years at least. But people who missed the Tesla train are desperate for a quick buck, and apes are hungry for new bad investments.Thus, I predict Rivian will fluctuate wildly for the first few days (weeks?) around its IPO price as everyone rich and poor tries to time the market for short-term gains, most fail, and eventually it will stabilize at a decent price, probably lower than IPO. Then, 6 months after IPO, it will go into the fucking toilet because all the insiders will liquidate. The high-level insiders won't cash out, but the cumulative effect of all the low-level employees cashing in options will cause the rest of the market to panic.Then, it'll slowly get better as they deliver (assuming they do) on their promises.I know this not because I am smart, but because of the voices in my head. I am not a financial advisor. I'm not even sure I qualify as human. More of a devolved simian-like ooze.
I love how all of the retards were downvoting me and dancing up and down because I said that the stock would fall.That the stock was only down a couple of percentage points.And even when I said that it would take longer than a day for the impact to be felt, they just continued to dance.Well, party is over retards.Go back to when Cisco fell over 80% and Amazon got toasted back during the internet bubble.I'm not saying Tesla will do that.I am saying it can.
I mean, Tesla is still up 31% from last month.  There is still a lot more to go üòÇ
Imagine how much tesla will drop the day elon mush will quit as ceo
Why is every single one of your posts a negative tesla post in investing subreddits?  I would take this guy with a grain of salt.
Tesla lost 2 weeks of gains in one day
Even your own post specifies ‚Äúpre-vetted customers‚Äù, and ‚Äúspecific routes‚ÄùMeanwhile I can buy a Tesla, take it somewhere it‚Äôs never been and get the same service I‚Äôd get anywhere else. GTFO.
Tesla still about $900 overvalued
Holy fuck Tesla puts would have printed so hard
So that dude blue whale chickens out out of his Tesla short and then buys BABA, and then Tesla drops pretty decent.That guy then shit on everyone saying how he started from 2k to 10 million and never provided any proof. This guy been banned yet? Wtf lol
Lemme get that Tesla loss porn
Slept in today. How are my Tesla calls doing?
Can Tesla go to 800 already Jesus Christ
Ah yes the daily "shit on Tesla" post from this guy
1040 being the resistance for tesla is ironic since elon is doing this for tax purposes....
When you choose to be a shareholder in a company, you choose the company's management as business partners.  You vote on the board members whose job it is to keep management's behavior aligned with your interests.  You as a shareholder can also bring specific changes forward at shareholder meetings for a vote.  There you go - those are the ways you can affect management behavior as a shareholder.  In practice, it's only the first one (choosing to own the stock or not) that most of us really control.  If you don't like Elon's behavior, you may want to reconsider the size of your Tesla holdings.  His recent behavior doesn't really seem that different from what he's done in the past.
They were a decent buy at 50 but now at 72 I feel like it's OP. They now have a full value 10% higher than Ford. It's going to crash down within the first few weeks. From that point it is a long play. It won't be the next "Tesla" as Tesla isn't an automotive company and both lucid and rivian are automotive first and foremost. But they will be similar to Tesla in the first few years with the run up to 200$. They will need to grow their product reach to get to Tesla levels but more importantly they need to keep quaility high.
Without Musk, Tesla would be around a 100b market cap (assuming performance of the company was identical). His eccentricity is what caused and fuels the fandom.
People in here worship elon and will buy Tesla way over fair value but won‚Äôt buy his first baby PayPal on a real dip. Buy high sell low, from millions to thousands‚Ä¶the WSB story ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
I expect some good loss porn Tesla boys. I watched in ahh as you posted those 200-300% option gains. Now I want to revel in those 100% percent account wipe outs!
This thread should be called Tesla Bagholders Daily DiscussionüòÇü§°
Not sure how any of this is surprising for someone who is long Tesla. If you‚Äôre invested in Tesla, you‚Äôre invested in Elon Musk and everything that comes with it.
Tesla is only falling cause of macro right?.. right? ü§°
From Wikipedia:* In March 2015, speaking at an Nvidia conference, Musk stated:&gt "I don't think we have to worry about autonomous cars because it's a sort of a narrow form of AI. It's not something I think is very difficult. To do autonomous driving that is to a degree much safer than a person, is much easier than people think." "... I almost view it like a solved problem."* In December 2015, Musk predicted "complete autonomy" by 2018. * At the end of 2016, Tesla expected to demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017, and in April 2017, Musk predicted that in around two years, drivers would be able to sleep in their vehicle while it drives itself. * In 2018 Tesla revised the date to demonstrate full autonomy to be by the end of 2019.* In February 2019, Musk stated that Tesla's FSD capability would be "feature complete" by the end of 2019:&gt "I think we will be feature complete, full self-driving, this year. Meaning the car will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up and take you all the way to your destination without an intervention. This year. I would say I am of certain of that, that is not a question mark. However, people sometimes will extrapolate that to mean now it works with 100% certainty, requiring no observation, perfectly, this is not the case."* In January 2020, Musk claimed the FSD software would be "feature complete" by the end of 2020, adding that feature complete "doesn't mean that features are working well".* In early 2021, Musk stated that Tesla would provide SAE Level 5 autonomy by the end of 2021
Lol Tesla going to lose a months worth of gains today
Okay I‚Äôm out on Tesla, see you guys again at $800
If you create a neural network that can acceptably navigate a defined route, you've created a neural network that can navigate that defined route. That's the scaling issue, you're basically using AI to answer the wrong question.If you have a defined route, you can only gather data to train the model from what it observes in the defined route, so it will only get good at running the route. This is why Waymo has been at this for what feels like decades and has made shockingly little progress.The biggest hurdle is the data, which Tesla has from years of driving data feeding back into its systems. They've now taken that data and created models that can auto tag/label the data (which was done manually previously), which means there's now telemetry feeding back to Tesla and systems that can analyze the data to optimize it to feed into Dojo. The data will allow FSD to learn, and learn at a rate that no amount of closed circuit/loop training could achieve.
MobilEye is not geofenced.No one talks about them because they are aj Intel comoany but they are every bit as far ahead as Tesla.
A million Tesla robotaxis paying for themselves while their owners sleep by the end of ... 2020 was it?

Tesla bag holder found.
Kimbal musk sold 88,500 shares of Tesla, the day before elons tweet
Congrats to all you Tesla bulls who made a ton of money, but I can‚Äôt handle being at the mercy of Elon‚Äôs twitter account.
RIP to all those Tesla call holders, Elon got you fucks again
Did Elon sell yet??? If not Tesla stock is F‚Äôk ed
I have a hard time believing a ton of people here are really playing Tesla options Bc of how expensive they r and y‚Äôall are poor. People always complain Amzn options are too expensive here
&gt Tesla is a company that makes electric cars. It has been around for over 10 years and has made many different models of car, but it only started making profits in the last 2 years - so if you bought shares when it first came out, your investment would have lost money every year until now. If you had invested $10k into Tesla at its IPO (Initial Public Offering), which was about 5-6 years after the company started to sell cars on a regular basis, then today your stock would be worth $1 million dollars
Honestly my life is a joke dude I fucking hate itTesla tanking? Cool I‚Äôll grab a put. Oh would you look at that, it‚Äôs starting to recover as soon as I buy. Waited a bit to see if it would dip back down but it was steady going up, so I grabbed a call only for it to start tanking again as soon as I buy. Down 50% in 30 mins this sucks
If course it is. The point is Tesla can't even do that.
Tesla bulls defend their precious at every opportunity
But the real trick is here is driving around busy city streets, following the rules, making real turns and not hitting anyone. Not being able to follow a GPS. And that‚Äôs what Tesla can‚Äôt do yet and maybe never will.
Will Tesla go under 1000 again?
Finally people getting know NVDA is true AI king not tesla
Not just Tesla. "Most things go up in the long term" is about as specific as you can ever get for anything
I dont' know much about the topic but Tesla's solution isn't geofenced, the other company's solution are geofenced.  So it's hard to compare the two.Tesla also seemed to always go for the most economic solution, either that is battery technology or self driving solution.  Guess time will tell.
SDC announcing they buying fleets of Tesla cars for company vehicles
NVDA is the new Tesla
First mistake was taking a loan for it. Second mistake is thinking Tesla was going to keep going after it ran so much. Hope it works out for you, IMO cut your losses. Never play with more money than you can afford to lose

So my birthday is coming up, November 18th, and as much as I've been dreading my 30th birthday here's my rags to riches story (As promised to my discord buddies as soon as F got to 20):    I was down big, I owed debts to friends which followed me into Bearish trades all last year. down nearly 160k earlier this year and almost nothing in my trading account, I hung my hat in shame. Trading isn't for me.    But the one stock I thought to rule them all was a long shot and it's slow movement made it almost unnoticeable to most of WSB. At the point where SPY broke 450 I realized hyperinflation is upon us, so what stock is safe? I thought and researched.    You might see previous posts I had touting Ford as better than Tesla, Biden being in leagues with Ford, Ford working with Google vs. GM with Microsoft and Apple Car. Uber was working with Ford Fusions back in 2014 in driverless cars. Ford's Rivian was better than GMs Nikola partnership. I kept asking myself, how is Ford worth the same as Nikola. Ford is AMERICANA. Infrastructure bill passed. Hello boom town.    So when my grandma announced she was selling her house which I had a 135k stake. I went to a rich friend and borrowed under that deal 100k, stuffed it all in 1960 F calls for next year Jan 21 2022. Sold out my 150k just last week. On track to 1 Mil by my birthday. I think I could've made 10 Mil if I went for 20 OTM calls instead of 15 ITM calls but hell, I needed to play it safe.    Well that's my story, Good luck guys, Diamond hands to all my friends who followed me one last time..

Balls deep in Tesla calls let‚Äôs fucking go yolo  !banbet TSLA $1550 4d If I lose I lost everything anyway üòé
Thanks for sharing this. Their product is hard to understand, but they are definitely not a consulting firm anymore. They used to, but i think they built enough custom applications to figure out the mother of all applications, which keeps getting better as they integrate more systems (skynet alert lol). This was made clear when they announced that Foundry can be implemented in DAYS, and also by their private enterprise growth rate. Also, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL can't just create a new team to compete with PLTR, who's been working for 12 years on this field (AI Data integration). It's like saying Ford will catch up to Tesla.
Oh Burrys back? Very bullish for Tesla
Michael Burry tweeting again. Bullish for tesla

Tesla up 10% tomorrow to make up for the paper hands ?
If Tesla had the same P/E ratio as Chewy it would be sitting at $11k per share
My Tesla calls are seriously gonna be fucked tomorrow ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
If Tesla was the highest market cap in all of its sub divisions and highest revenue in all of them, it still wouldnt come close to reaching the fundamentals that mathematically a 1.2 trillion market cap company should have. The fact that that is upvoted just shows the cult bias in this sub. And I get it, a lot of you have made a ton of money on Tesla, and I hope yall continue to do so
Boutta email Robinhood telling them those 10k that was purchased in tesla calls last week wasn‚Äôt me‚Ä¶ it was the hackers

Tesla -5% until tomorrow pre market
Tesla 1300 EOW
Got a chuckle out of this lolI have been wrong before, but something tells me that Lucid‚Äôs 90% share price increase over the past 3 months is *not* because Elon is selling 10% of his Tesla shares
Hmm do I put my entire portfolio into Tesla call options. Approx. 70k???
so you are saying that Elon is the only costumer of tesla ?
He was. However this is a great way to control the narrative instead of letting "journalists" write that Elon is secretly selling stocks, the sky is falling, Tesla is doomed etc.
They meant that some people cannot play with Tesla options at all because of the steep price.
The power that I hold to buy one Tesla call and watch the stock plummet.
The high IQ ‚ÄúTesla will drop 50%‚Äù posters are really quiet today.
Yeah but tesla has 60% retail ownership and most of them are completely retarded, they really don‚Äôt know what a market cap is, so if it splits it will double in 3 months.
Musk overtook him due to Tesla's recent rally and NASA picking Space X over Blue Origin.Given the Tesla poll it might be Bezos again by the end of the week.
You could probably carpool with the other Tesla bears to get your food stamps. Should save a few $‚Äôs and be able to earn a few more giving handy‚Äôs so you can try again in a decade.
Tesla has 400 years of sales priced in. Your point?
sold off one of my ITM tesla leaps at 200% gain to purchase 4 OTM amd leaps. they are now ITM. it's been a good day.
This damn stock only goes up.I was hoping to make $5k on my Tesla put(first ever option purchase). Instead I only made $900.No yacht for me. FML
Not even close... Tesla sells more in a month from one factory than they sell in a quarter/year.  And # of factories are doubling next year.   And then probably again in a few years.but even if they sold the same number Tesla would make more profit.[Audi Sold **20,000** BEVs In Q3 2021, But Less Than 1,000 In The U.S.](https://insideevs.com/news/541551/audi-bevs-sales-2021q3/)[Sales of the all-electric Porsche Taycan/Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo family increased by 36% year-over-year to **8,818**](https://insideevs.com/news/540897/porsche-taycan-sales-2021q3/)[China: MIC Tesla Sales Exceed **54,000** In October 2021](https://insideevs.com/news/546182/china-mic-tesla-sales-october2021/)
The electric motors are objectively better. Something like 3 times the power/weight ratio of Tesla motors
Their excellent margins. 14.6% operating margin vs ford's operating margin of 5.5% recently for example. Plus Tesla owns the largest and best charging network in the world. They are also starting to roll out Tesla insurance to more areas. To name only two things.
Please Tesla go green. Please Tesla bears post the loss porn. This is hilarious
I love Tesla but I liquidated half of my stockIt‚Äôs a 10 bagger for me and that‚Äôs good enough for me to take some money off the table
**WSJ: Tesla bears file lawsuit to get Elon removed from Twitter** *‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt keep getting away with this‚Äù, one bear said in the filing. ‚ÄúHe puts out an inflammatory tweet and two days later his stock is at another all time high‚Äù*
I swear, Tesla is a cheat code. Just buy when it dips stupid
Also lets have some perspective here  its NOV 8th, the stock is down 1.5% from NOV 1st People are freaking out that tesla is "crashing" when it is trading at the level it was 10 days ago!People need to get off their phones and put some perspective in mind. A stock staying flat for 10 days shouldn't be news.
Is tesla going back past 1200?
Tesla bears were dancing for all of 10 minutes after open
&gt I've never heard of Tesla.
If Tesla ends green today I will do a naked dance in front of my 95 year old grammmma
LMAO Tesla. RIP Puts
Tesla 1300 EOW
Elon ‚ÄúI burnt every Tesla factory to the ground‚Äù *2% dip that recovers mid day‚Äù
I was promised tesla $900
I bought Tesla calls
I was wrong to say the tesla dip would only last six minutes. Maybe 15
I won‚Äôt even be surprised if Tesla finishes the day green
Tesla calls feel like a no brainer right now
Pepsi getting trucks from Tesla? THATS BIG
No worries about that, PepsiCo CEO just confirmed they are starting to receive Tesla Semis this Q4...
Him selling 10% of his stake in Tesla equals 2.3% of all tesla shares ($27B), which is almost identical to Tesla's revenue in the last 6 months ($26B).
**Elon sells 20bil worth of TSLA stock to pay for taxes**üêªüéâ**Government recognises Elon as a responsible Billionaire, awards Tesla with a 100bil EV government contract**üêªüî´
If tesla closes green‚Ä¶ Elon can do whatever the fuck he wants. It‚Äôs his world now.
The secret ingredient is crimeAlso:&gtWhy does ur pp look like u just came?&gt  &gt-Elon Musk, *CEO of fucking TESLA*How is this guy still at the steering wheel again?
To be fair Kimball Musk is a billionaire multiple time throught Tesla while having never worked there (at least I think). There is a shit load of board members large investors in the business world and real estate world who are far wealthier than 10m$ and have never done anything.Even if you don't think its work being a politician can be more work than most corporate jobs. I work in the private sector and my gf work in the public sector. We both work from home and make similar salaries (low six figures) but she has a shit ton more work than I lol.
Let‚Äôs be honest: if you sell Tesla today you deserve to be poor. He‚Äôs selling to pay an $18B tax bill. It‚Äôs that simple. The poll was engineered to garner good will for what he was already going to do
Imagine tesla goes to 1300 on open and melts shorties lol. ü•≤
Sheesh‚Ä¶..musk has Aug 2022 $6 Tesla calls ü§£ü§£ü§£And we thought DFV nailed it with those GME calls‚Ä¶..
&gt Tesla is going to be a $1 trillion dollar company.
i like how this implies logic wont work for tesla
Holy duck I‚Äôm gonna yolo on TESLA 1300c for this week. Blowout numbers for china deliveries this quarter‚Ä¶ daddy musk might hit a million cars this years
Tesla Investors: "If you look at what time Elon tweeted that poll, look at the phase of the moon on that day, add in his kids birthday, and subtract the date when he smoked weed on joe rogan.... etc. Elon is a fukken GENIUS HOLY FUK!"Elon Musk reality: "LMAO you won't believe what I posted on twitter last night when I was high as fuk! This is gonna be hilarious!"
Lmao Tesla ATH close today.
Never bet against Tesla. At least not for longer than a few weeks. Remember the last dip before it went to $1k?Forget about it.
If you had put 10K into just Tesla 10 years ago you‚Äôd have 2 million. Your argument is basically for market timing. You would have had to have knowledge that after the 2008 recession USA stocks were going to explode. There is no way to have known that. And there is no way to accurately predict future performance. Therefore more diversification makes the most sense for a very large number of people. If that‚Äôs not you then cool, but I don‚Äôt think your argument is strong enough to change the minds of people who have actually examined it for themselves.
Tesla getting pummelled harder than an ambulance at a Travis Scott concert
Yeah.I can honestly say I am not surprised. Like, I actually commented yesterday that him EVENTUALLY selling 10% of his stock won't just crash Tesla.There is no timeframe on his plan...
what if this is all an elaborate plan by elon to fuck the bears one last time. Hes going to make everyone buy puts only to announce next week tesla has cold fusion reactor
We talking about the guy who's already been in trouble for tweets about Tesla stock?
Shorting Tesla hasn't worked out too well for a lot of people.
Tesla put guy def specing his lambo out right now
Its not even him anymore. He could tweet "PLEASE STOP BUYING THE STOCK. I SOLD ALL OF MY STAKE AND I AM RESIGNING TODAY. PLEASE THEY HAVE MY MOTHER AND THEY TOLD ME THE STOCK HAS TO GO BELOW 300"and dipshits on twatter and tikitok investment gurus would blow their pants off with a sustained rocket of cumTESLA 50000 EOW BUY EVERY CALL AVAILABLE. SELL YOUR SISTER INTO SLAVERY AND BUY MORE CALLS YOU CANNOT LOSE!
I hope every Tesla bull is in shambles today To spite you. Because I sold before it split for like $300 a share which wouldNow be 4 shares so eat a dongus
Mark my words. Tesla will go green by EOD.
Fuck you VisualMod, you used premarket price in my bet and now tesla has to drop 27% today
Maturing as an investor, is realising Tesla is overvalued‚Ä¶ But don‚Äôt you dare stand in-front of the steamroller that‚Äôs is the Tesla bull gang.
No idea why you got downvoted this is literally how rich people live. People in here dickriding Elon because "memes" thinking he actually lives off $1000 a month and lives in a shack because he doesn't technically take a salary at Tesla.Go to a bank with a hundred billion dollar investment portfolio and they will have the CEO take you out for dinner begging for to loan you money.
The price would be a 1/10 of what it is if he STFU. The 2 things in life which defy all rules are Elon and Tesla Stock
I feel like TESLA is gonna moon anywqys cuz retarded strengh
Tesla could go down 20% and still be massively overvalued
Tesla is the most overvalued stock of all time.
Tesla is going to dump so hard, then bounce, then dump even more. Knowing this I‚Äôll still somehow lose money tomorrow
Tesla is down 6% yet spy futures is fucking green?! Lmaoo this market is more retarded than me.. selling ALL my puts at open and just buying calls. This is mental
Funny thing is, everyone‚Äôs expecting blood‚Ä¶ So because it‚Äôs Tesla, will probably go up. Lol.
So 9 minutes until Tesla sell off
Rip anyone that held Tesla calls this weekend lmfao
Tesla down 7.5% in Frankfurt.
Good god damn had Tesla puts over the weekend last week. Lost my shirt on them.  Wrong by a week.
Imagine if he used tesla bots to upvote yes
&gt Well, they're not Teslas. They are all Model 3s that have been converted to look like Teslas with a Tesla paint job and some fake badges on the back
Elon took a poll ... and now tomorrow I'll take a pole, up the ass with these Tesla calls and cash secured puts
Tesla isn‚Äôt going to stay up this high. 1200 is pricing in half of the decade.
Only thing that justifies Tesla market cap is if it could fly its cars like Weasleys Ford Anglia in Harry Potter.  But then again, Weasleys couldn‚Äôt afford Tesla.
&gt Tesla is a scam with no fundamentals.
Tomorrow is going to be so fucking hilarious watching Tesla bulls get absolutely slaughtered
so..... change of plan, we long tesla now?
Tesla down by 7 virgin goats in Kabul
I‚Äôve never seen a Tesla not going 5 miles under the speed limit. Tesla drivers drive slow af. Prob the quietness of the ride puts them to sleep
2022 Tesla models come with individual butt plugs Enjoy retards ü§ì
Gordon mad his tesla is tanking lol
The problem is that you didn‚Äôt put a time period on this nor a region. Say you are talking about a relatively near future, to 2024 and globally. It won‚Äôt be Rivian, Lucid, GM, or Ford in 2nd place. It will be either VW Group (VW, Audi, Porsche, Skoda, etc) or a Chinese company, like BYD, NIO, Li, Shanghai or Xpeng. Folks dismissing Chinese auto companies are living in the past and can‚Äôt predict the future.Of the 4, only GM has the cell supply and scale to make a run for it. Lucid and Rivian will still be making a pittance in terms of volume and therefore revenue. In 2023, both Nio and Xpeng are probably making 500,000 world class vehicles a year, or what Tesla did last year. GM will claim some big numbers, but those will be mostly the $4,000 microcars made and sold in China. In terms of world class vehicles, GM will get some of their new LG JV cell production online. Ford will still be way behind.In the 2030 time period, well, it may be all 4 of these are bankrupt.
Tesla will gap down to about -5% around 7am and then find a way to finish +0.69% by close. It has been written.
Damn first I hear Nikola Tesla passed away now I‚Äôm hearing Joe Rogan is getting delisted from the stock exchange? Smh worst day ever.
Tesla Puts hitting hard tomorrow PTON hard
What is this universe coming to lmao, if Gordon‚Äôs on board then Tesla to the moon for sure
If you think tesla is tanking spy your insane lol. Tesla is only 2% in the spy etf index.
So Tesla Puts at open tomorrow?
Tomorrow imma play a little game called cost averaging down my Tesla calls so I can lose twice as much when they expire worthless
Everyone in here googling ‚Äúhow to short Tesla‚Äù. This is going to end spectacularly
&gt Tesla is a garbage company.
&gt Tesla is being delisted from the Nasdaq. It will trade on an exchange called OTCQX, which trades over-the-counter stocks that are not listed on a major U.S. stock market such as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Stock Market
‚ÄúNo matter the results of the poll, Musk would have likely started selling millions of shares this quarter. The reason: a looming tax bill of more than $15 billion.Musk was awarded options in 2012 as part of a compensation plan. Because he doesn‚Äôt take a salary or cash bonus, his wealth comes from stock awards and the gains in Tesla‚Äôs share price. The 2012 award was for 22.8 million shares at a strike price of $6.24 per share. Tesla shares closed at $1,222.09 on Friday, meaning his gain on the shares totals just under $28 billion.The company has also recently disclosed that Musk has taken out loans using his shares as collateral, and with the sales, Musk may want to repay some of those loan obligations.‚ÄùTldr: Elon is just being an attention whore like always. Still glad I did my democratic duty by voting though.
Tesla down -66% in Easter island futures based on measuring the length of the head statue shadows.
I can't wait to hear from the person that was shorting Tesla tomorrow
This is year 2050 Tesla is now worth 50k after 20 stock splits and traded at 500 dollarsExpecting boost from his sons twiter
I have a dream that I‚Äôm liquidating my portfolio to buy Tesla calls for third quarter of next year. Then I‚Äôm moving to the Florida swamp and never setting foot in society again. Lambo swamp boat, naked hunting pythons with my wife retarded dogs
&gt I just got a call from Elon. He said that he is going to take Tesla private at $420 per share.
Jeffries just increased their tesla price target from 950 to 1450 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I can‚Äôt believe there are people here who honestly believe Tesla share prices can rise tomorrow. Total delusions.
&gt Visualmod recommends buying calls on Tesla.
Looking forward to the majority of people on here loading up on either Tesla calls / puts at the bell and then watching those options go -30% within an hour because it‚Äôs there‚Äôs one thing you can bet on, it‚Äôs the majority being unable to accurately predict Tesla‚Äôs price movements
I will legit go buy a green dildo and put it up my ass like the WoW freak out kid with the remote if Tesla ends green tomorrow
Predictions for tomorrow.  Tesla dips and recovers.  Market goes fat sack green.  Every stock is up, everyone is splooging and having a great time.  Except Tilray.  Tilray is down 1.5%
At least I don‚Äôt have any Tesla calls
I think Tesla is gonna be at a 5 billion bagillion million by this Friday I‚Äôm so sure @banbet or however tf u do that shit
I had a dream that involved pumping a whale but it didn't involve Tesla.
TSLA is like 6.4% of QQQ. The difference between Dow futures (flat) and Nasdaq futures (-0.35%) right now implies about a 6% drop for Tesla at the open tomorrow, assuming all else equal.
Dear god, look at those Tesla puts, perfectly timed to ride the panic selling wave and then turn back it into calls. And those AMZN calls‚ÄúEverything ok Bateman‚Äù
Not touching Tesla with a 10 foot pole. Not because it could go either way but because I'm poor
So muskrat punps tesla on fake hertz rumors before he dumps 10 percent.  Totally about moving the human race forward and nothing to do with profit.
ShOrT lAdDeR aTtAcK oN tEsLa!!!
Feels good to be non - Fomo for real. People holding Tesla must have some adrenaline going right now though . üòÜ
ford. also, this is gonna be like bmw versus kia. sure tesla tech may be way better. but the average person is gonna enter the ev market w a cheap affordable option.
I don't think lucid can catch up to Tesla but maybe they'll be close
Tesla call holders got absolutely screwed. He had to do it on a weekend too
Yeah I think Tesla is way overvalued but no fucking way am I betting against TSLA.
All the tech companies are overvalued, Google, Apple, Amazon, FB, Tesla. Infact they been overvalued from day one right? Or maybe. None of them are overvalued, because they are all growth companies that make a ton of money and make even more as time passes. And they are priced just right. When people say something is overvalued for 20 years, just maybe the people are wrong.
Wedbush just upgraded Tesla from $1,500 to $1,800.. found the guy who doesn‚Äôt want to be the Bagholder
Elon is basically going to double the short interest on Tesla. It was already the largest short position in history by dollar value.
Cmon, open the stock casinoI wanna see Tesla do the thing
So Tesla 1300 at open?
Elon owns Tesla puts. Hands down
Tesla gonna be bought up so fast. Puts better sell at open!
Scam. Keep your money and invest responabily.    8k to 100k in 2 weeks ... if that was possible Elon Musk would sell his Tesla stock and be investing with this guy.
Lucid, Rivian, Tesla, Ford
Luck. Tesla is a crap shoot. Musk could upload a sextape with Grimes on pornhub and the stock could go up 20%...or down 20%. Musk literally said "stock is too high stop buying it" and it went UP in price. I'm up 5 digits in TSLA, but I don't play options or try to swing it. I've tried it twice, and it's pure gambling no matter what the news or information is.
Their share of the car market is a sliver. And they‚Äôre worth more than all the other car companies COMBINED. Even if they keep doubling car deliveries for 3 years, they‚Äôll still have a sliver and other companies will have put out fleets of EV cars. I‚Äôm a Tesla Model S owner and I love my car, but the stock is just absurd.
I bought the Tesla top
Tesla bear r fuk
they asume correctlyalso, have we forgotten that elon is basically Full invested on SpaceX now?Starship is a paradigm changer, a literal "now and then" on mankind's history...Tesla is good, but spacex is LEGEND
The Tesla fear right now makes me confident in tomorrow being green as fuck
it was overvalued 4 years ago, and 3, and 2...and tesla keeps almost doubling deliveries to clients, and keeps opening new factoriesand they keep having no competition, cause let's face it, even if a big automaker goes FULL EV, they will still need at least 2 years to ramp production to where Tesla has it.... and like Tesla is going to stay idle üòÇ800 thousand cars delivered in the past 12 months keep telling me otherwise
Tesla dip = others buy. Cash don't make stacks sitting in the "buying power" - the money will flow somewhere
Yeah, and in 2016 Ford sold around 6 mil. While Tesla has grown 50% year over year on average. This year they look like they will sell 860k or more. Which would mean ~70% growth. This year/early next year 2 giant factories will come online for an almost guaranteed 50+% yoy growth again. Tesla had 14.6% operating margin recently while Ford had like 5.5%What does Ford have going for it? Weak margins, and dragging their feet on the EV revolution. 40%-50% of sales projected to be electrified (not even all BEV iirc) planned. How exciting.
Tesla options are fucking suicidal either way.
IV crush can get you... but I made 200% on NVDA puts in a few min last week due to the price dropping faster than IV crush. Held for 7 minutes and IV was 140% when I bought and 109% when I sold. If the price drops fast enough IV% doesn't matter. ESPECIALLY on weeklies or FD's. Tesla is no different.
Elon selling 17 million shares of Tesla when Tesla daily volume can reach 60 million? I ain't worried.
\*BLOOMBERG: ELON MUSK ACCIDENTALLY BUYS - NOT SELLS - 35 BILLION IN TESLA STOCK. "SORRY FOR YOUR PUTS, I WAS HIGH AS FUCK" - MUSK.

So tesla puts actually going to be the play for once in a lifetime?
What ever happened to that "Elon's got to submit what he's going to tweet before he tweets it, if it's something that could affect Tesla" rule?

This is why allowing Tesla into the SPY was a mistake and they were warned. Elon is way too unstable.
Gonna sit back and watch Tesla shit show tomorrow. Got no skin in the game
Tesla gonna dip bigly
I was considering doing that too, but I don‚Äôt want to mess up my $38 cost average.  Nothing has changed and Tesla is still scaling amazingly. Even if Elon sells, it will be a non event imo.
You are assuming Tesla follows any logic
The performance of Tesla stock has been amazing. It‚Äôs more than a car company, it‚Äôs a new store of value. A new economic paradigm. And who has more Tesla stock on their balance sheet than anyone else? Tesla. They can literally print it! I keep telling you guys, Tesla is more than a car company.
How gullible are Tesla investors? Elon knows that Tesla stock price is not sustainable and wants to sell 10% at this eye bleeding high price. He‚Äôs just playing game to make you think that ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù made the decision but in reality, ‚ÄúHE‚Äù had already made a decision
Short reason: Because Tesla&amp#x200Blong reason: same reason it doubled last time, because tesla
Tesla down 124% on the Ethiopian coffee bean trade market! Only worth 24 beans now!
advertising paid for by Tesla isn‚Äôt a source
It's extremely disingenuous of him to pretend he has access to no money outside of dumping only tesla stock, and makes me dislike him even more.He's trying to drive investors to push politicians to stop trying to tax billionaires and he's a scum bag.

Lol, guess someone is jacked to the tits in Tesla calls
Every car sold for the next 100 years being a Tesla is currently priced in
Lol. I'm thinking about Tesla distribution in a 100% positive gamma environment on Nasdaq...maybe it's flows going to laggards.  Will have to look at what possibilities exist.
I am so confused I am gonna short Tesla on fidelity and buy it on Schwab ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Elon giving everyone who missed that insane Tesla run another chance to buy in lmao
Without using big word, this is literally just saying ‚ÄúTesla will go down and because it will go down, it‚Äôll go up‚Äù
I still have no idea how the market will react or when he 'will' sell, if he hasn't already started.  I need to look at the option flow on Tesla.
General market correction incoming. Tesla is a meme stock and it will crash the market for like 2 days
Infrastructure bill priced in, tesla gonna tank, spy 500 EOW
I hate myself for agreeing with you. Will probably enter my first Tesla position sometime tomorrow.
So many Tesla call holders are about to get blown up Monday
Looks like Tesla is about to go crazy my guess is a massive drop in pre-market on Monday and then everyone tries to buy back in at the low price because Tesla is such an amazing Long term company.
Oooo fck tesla under 1k at germany markets greedy call holders are so cuckex
[Just wait until Elon finds aliens on Mars, and opens up a whole new market for Tesla sales](https://youtu.be/NpsulBGyHQc?t=59)
That guy who linked 250k in Tesla puts on Friday has got to be licking his chops. Going to be a multimillionaire after early this week.
I think Musk pops the Tesla stock bubble prematurely like this in small bursts on purpose. And when it goes down he calls it correction and whaddaya know, the new baseline for Tesla is much higher than if a real bubble exploded.
Remember when he tweeted ‚ÄúTesla stock too high Imo‚Äù last year and it dropped 10%. This will only benefit people who recently already bought puts. People will buy the dip giving him liquid funds for free.
Well i am going to hold on to my Tesla until i retire !!
Love Tesla and all, but under no normal circumstances would selling if Elon cause the stock to rally to 2K.
Nvda going to keep running while you're distracted by Tesla and Elon hijinks
First- I‚Äôm upset with myself for not going with my gut Friday and selling some other shares to buy puts on Tesla mid day. Second- I know this is going to really suck for anyone that has calls expiring soon or recently bought some. But I‚Äôd have to ask why were you still buying calls on what was one of the biggest record run in stock history. Three- Easy solution to all of this if you are a share holder in Tesla, HOLD.
Musk doesn't buy his shares. In case your unaware of his compensation package. And he will be getting a massive boatload of more shares very soon. Based on Tesla performance and share price. A good chunk of his compensation was tied to shares price, sales, etc.
I'm thinking about it as well but concerned about IV. Also, the gamma position on Nasdaq is insane, we may be in for a parabolic run.  I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla goes to 2k.
Two weeks ago she sold Tesla to buy snapchat and twitter... late last week she was selling TSLA to buy Zillow... lol
He might as well because nobody is going to want to hold Tesla knowing it will begin to drop
How retarded is OP?Tesla $2,000 after Elon dumps his bags.I'm going to save this post and check back next summer.
GameStop wasn't horribly over valued when that game kicked off.  Tesla could fall a long way very fast.  At which point I'll change our my put for calls.
&gtWhere would they get the money to buy more Tesla stock lol.Easy. Sell TSLA stock so you can buy more TSLA stock. Duh.
Tesla call holders in absolute shambles begging people to vote no on Twitter you can‚Äôt make this up.
The N bomb will probably be the next 6 Tesla models, just like S3XY.Just watch TSLA moon.
It‚Äôs hilarious to me that the best chance tesla Bears Have had in six months is Elon‚Äòs own tweet
I think he always wanted to sell tesla stock when it's way overpriced, and now he has the chance as he won't get any backlash.
The old ‚Äúfolks will sell all their stocks to avoid impending capital gains!!‚Äù argument. I‚Äôve heard it all before. Never seen data to support it. If he‚Äôs selling:1) its advisable to diversify his wealth. 2) he‚Äôs gonna invest his proceeds in new stocks or back into tesla (if its really for capital gains avoidance). No net market impact either way. 3) we still have step ups in basis at death right?4) we still have charitable write offs for low-basis/appreciated stock. Wealthy folks set up family foundations and use all sorts of other FLP techniques to transfer shares at tax-favorable rates. Selling shares to pay huge gains when he can transfer these with various tax avoidance strategies and avoid almost all gains seems like a very simpleton move for a guy who has an army of the best tax advisors money can buy.
Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock.Do you support this?Yes 57.2%No42.8%3,200,075 votes¬∑3 hours left12:17 PM ¬∑ Nov 6, 2021¬∑Twitter for iPhone
No one knows and anyone telling you otherwise is full of shit. He could dump all his shares premarket and Tesla opens at $900. He could sell small amounts for months while Tesla continues up. Everyone is guessing
Entire market crash is possible now‚Ä¶.perfect storm has come. These fools just tanked the Economy for government taxes that we won‚Äôt see lol‚Ä¶bye bye Teslaü§ô

Tesla stock jumps on news of Herz buying 100k vehicles, and Musk:- denies the contract has been singned: stock jumps- talks about opening TITS university: stock jumps- says he will sell 2% to end world hunger: stock jumps- says he will sell 10% to pay taxes: stock _______If I were you, I would go easy on buying puts.This is not a financial advice.
Retail uses overvalued Tesla shares to leverage up to keep buying the bubble. Elon sparks a sell off. Tesla drags down SPY. Cascading margin calls collapse the global economy. Pretty standard bear fanfic.

Tesla is going to be ok mom, right ?
&gtAlso. Where would they get the money to buy more Tesla stock lol.By getting a job at Walmart like a regular person duhh
The amount of Tesla bulls here shitting themselves far outweigh the amount of bears primed to drop a massive load cum tomorrow
I genuinely think tesla will end the day up tomorrow

I cant wait for tommorow Tesla might dip 2% and everyone is gonna rush to buy puts thinking they are a genius and it will close green
Yeahhh... I bought tesla calls (maybe puts?) once. Never again, I don't have the bankroll for that shit.
You don‚Äôt understand lol. You have people with massive wealth tied up in the stock. They want money to buy yachts and shit. They don‚Äôt need to gamble on more TSLA stock. Also. Where would they get the money to buy more Tesla stock lol.
Hell no. The game or party is over. I was a Tesla bull, this is delusional. Tesla is not more worth then Volkswagen, Daimler, Toyota and Ford all together
He is selling at the top in your face. What a true cult leader. We all knew Tesla is overvalued and the other market markers are undervalued. His baby no1 is SpaceX and not Tesla.
You obviously never worked in tech or executive of a company where 50-80% of your pay is RSU based. Example: you are a VP and your comp package is $165k - $225k base, cash at risk bonus $0 - $50k, and RSU $0 - $200k.Once a block of RSU‚Äôs mature you cash them in. For Tesla employees they just cleared $1M because the price they were issued and the growth of share price while maturing. You pull the trigger because you have more blocks or issues coming up next quarter or year. Every fin planner will tell you to cash in because you don‚Äôt want to be over leveraged.
I have a left-field theory that the explosion of the stock price actually makes it harder to run Tesla. Tesla has super high burnout/turnover rate it is a company that has simply not given a rats ass about the working culture, the culture that comes straight from the asburger king himself.Know what makes it tough to run a culture like that? Everyone in the building being a multi millionaire. Employees not caring a tremendous amount about the ridiculous rampage firings because they could retire at a moments notice. 8 weeks of pay to waive your right to sue for being illegally terminated isn't enough any longer.Outside the company the stock price gives Elon more and more fame and power. Inside the company, it erodes his power.
So‚Ä¶ Tesla 2,000 EOY, got it!
Since all of WSB is talking ‚ÄúpOoTs oN tEsLa‚Äù, I‚Äôm dumping all my money on calls. If you know, you know.
Lucid is great but Tesla isn‚Äôt going anywhere
Nah, Tesla puts then Tesla leaps
I‚Äôm gonna laugh If you all play puts, Elon sells and somehow Tesla stock still moons
There seems to be a lot of people commenting on this thread who are completely disregarding that Tesla doesn't follow any rules.
I wouldnt touch TSLA calls or puts with a 10-foot pole, ever. Elon can tweet that he's nuking all of their gigafactories on Monday and Elon fanboys will be like..."He has nukes...? Tesla made nukes??? Tesla ruling the world!!" You really just cant fight retard strength.
It's not about the 2% being sold that makes this bad for Tesla. It's the fact that the leader of a trillion dollar company is relying on a twitter poll for whether or not he liquidates $25+ billion of stock and 10% of his control in the company. This is a horrible look for the company no matter what the outcome.
Hell yeah first short ever is tesla. That's one way to end your stay on earth
Article posted today in the Guardian:‚ÄúTesla board members including Elon Musk‚Äôs brother Kimbal have recently sold shares in the electric carmaker. Kimbal Musk sold 88,500 shares while fellow board member Ira Ehrenpreis sold shares worth more than $200m.‚ÄùPuts are back on the menu boys.
It is 2% of Tesla stock. I don‚Äôt think the effect will be as great as you all think.
Tesla will probably be up 5% on Monday
Sigh.Sell Tesla calls at open.  Buy puts.  Probably get screwed on both
The thought is people will buy the dip in the morning and it will go on unaffected because that type of illogical shit happens all the time with Tesla
If I had to guess, Elon is ready to cash out of Tesla so he can focus more on SpaceX. Tesla has basically gotten over the hump and it's a game of scaling, operational efficiency, and increment upgrades to the cars. SpaceX just installed giant "chopsticks" on it's Texas launch tower to "catch" the biggest spaceships ever developed when they land.
Oh no! Anyway, Tesla 1500 EOM.
I‚Äôll get a Tesla tattoo if it breaks $1500 eow. That‚Äôs if I don‚Äôt paperhands my call at open on Monday.
I drive a Tesla and try to bring it up in every single conversation within the first 30 seconds and it's not because I love the environment. It's because I love blowjobs.
My Tesla puts are -40%. Y‚Äôall think I can recover??
Tesla always raises capital after the retards fomo I‚Äôm on a parabolic move. This time Elon‚Äôs discovered a way to say he‚Äôs only doing it ‚Äúcus the people want him to‚Äù
&gt You are getting a dicking from Tesla on Monday.
How much of a dicking am I getting from tesla on monday? Just the tip or 15 inches?
Tesla $1500 by end of week
I'm feeling it for you. Wish I pulled the trigger but I have tengo'd with Tesla and have gotten my ass handed to me every time. But if I had puts I'd be feeling pretty good. If it doesn't go down on this news. Tesla will have achieved it's final form and nothing will stop it.
Short Tesla premarket to delta hedge your call position
With the way tesla moves, it will be 64b.
The big short part 2: Everyone laughed at him while Tesla kept going up until 1 tweet stopped the music. Autistic investor vs autistic billionaire.
That guy who posted his multi million dollar Tesla short plan is shitting bricks of gold rn
Mod check plz... title is misleading."Musk asks Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of Tesla stock"...even if the poll passes (which it hasn't *yet*, 20 hours left), he wouldn't be dumping them on Monday.
Elon always pulls off stuff like this. I held Tesla since 2014, sold last of my shares beginning of this year, so I have an understanding and sympathy for new Tesla investors.  I love to see him IPO SpaceX. That beauty will rise faster than Tesla.
If this comment gets 10 upvotes I will sell 10% of my Tesla shares. I only own .3 shares so if somebody could help me figure out the fraction too thx
I voted yes and I don‚Äôt own any Tesla ü§£
Or ELON ‚Äú taking Tesla private at 420 a share‚Äù
He will sell 10%. That is not too bad.You are going to need a market catalyst (rate hike, China real estate, Taiwan etc) to crash Tesla and the market. Amazon crashed 94% in Dotcom.
But it's tesla. It rarely follows expectations and predictions. Yeah it'll dip, but nothing like if a "normal" company did the same. I'm going to say no more than 15% drop and that'll be short lived, in a week it'll recover most if not all.
Wow, this looks really bad, if this news hits mainstream media... Tesla could tank pretty hard ü§Ø
Jesus Christ Elon doesn't own Tesla 100% he can't sell other people's stock, he can only sell his share of it.
If you want to do an ‚Äúinvestor move‚Äù buy some puts to soften the blow. I wanted to buy puts on Friday because I noticed the fuel in the rocket was running low for Tesla, but I didn‚Äôt have enough that wasn‚Äôt tied up already to do so.
Shorted Tesla Friday, you wouldn‚Äôt fucking believe. Finally growed a pair of nuts thinking it was extremely overvalued for so long.
I‚Äôm assuming Elon is selling because he thinks Tesla is overvalued and wants to cash some out.By doing this tweet, he can give some deniability on why he chose to sell. Selling without the tweet, filing the report, and saying he did it because he cares about taxes doesn‚Äôt make sense.Overall, I think he should‚Äôve just sold and filed and everyone who bought at this ridiculous levels can just suck it up lol
He avoids paying tax buy getting loans against his assets (Tesla stock).The rich have many ways to avoid taxes that you don't even realise. If most people knew all the ways that there are to legally avoid paying taxes when you are not employed, there would be riots everywhere. But this tactics are very obscure and you only learn them once you are in a position to take advantage of it.Not taking a salary from the company might sound honorable, but it's not.It's not his fault, because it's legal to do so, but the law is wrong.Take it from someone who also benefits from these tactics, obviously at a much smaller scale.I feel bad for it, but everyone else is doing it, and it's totally legal, but it just opens one's eyes for what's going on with people who make millions and billions.Taxing unrealised gains is dumb, what they should be doing is to prevent people from using these unrealised gains to fund their lives without paying taxes, or paying very little.
I think he‚Äôs telling us to buy Tesla puts
One of those rare moments where I can understand r/enoughmuskspam I'm usually a Tesla and SpaceX fan
I thought Tesla was overvalued so I got Dec 17 1230P, now Elon is my best friend
Nah, he just thinks the price if Tesla is too high
It is a smart move of him. He only needs capital to exercise options for achieved goals, that he and Tesla agreed upon. Using this poll, he is covering his master plan. In the end he will have even more stocks, but in the form of options.
Tesla puts guy is about to buy the most ironic Tesla ever
Tesla was overvalued. Big sell off at Monday.
Also acceptable: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking Tesla private at $4,206.90‚Äù
My net worth is like 4 grand so to prevent me from spending money on prostitute and not failing NNN i bought 2 tesla stock at 1230. How fricked I am
If he sells that amount of stock, so will a lot of hedge funds and investors that hold any amount of Tesla stock. Predicting the price will shoot straight down, even under 900
Put buyers: we‚Äôre going to get paid. Call buyers: we‚Äôre going to 0. Reality: Tesla always moons.
Put buyers: we‚Äôre going to get paid. Call buyers: we‚Äôre going to 0. Reality: Tesla always moons.
Apple is priced at below 30 times it‚Äôs earning. It‚Äôs valuations can in no way be compared against Tesla, even if you argue 30 is a high multiple
tesla puts confirmed
Tesla, Nvidia is getting there as well‚Ä¶Tesla could easily reach $2T+ next year before crashing like Amazon did after Dotcom.Markets never crash because they are overvalued, need a catalyst.
lol I will buy tickets in the form of Tesla stock if he makes it dip
"Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock."so instead he wants to cash in on overpriced stock and BEFORE the new taxes might comesuch a good guy...
if you are still holding Tesla calls/shares you deserve a loss.
What's crazier is Elon's brother sold 100M worth of Tesla stock yesterday. This fucker knew
Whatever, I‚Äôm buying more shares anyways.  Converting my safe etfs in retirement account to tesla
In Tesla we Trust. Musky, you said once I decided to follow you,You'd walk with me all the way.But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my PUTS,there was only one set of footprints.I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me. He whispered, "My precious child, I love you and will never leave you bag holding. Never, ever, during your trials and testings did your portfolio fail.When you saw only one set of footprints,It was then that I carried you, with tweets and memes. For I love all my Bulls and Bears equally. Tendies! Hallelujah!
Shout out to Michael Garcia with the sell of tesla on oct 25th @ \~$1000, literally the start of the pump to $1200 in the next week
"Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock."He makes it seem like he is a good man for not doing tax avoidance, but he justs wants to cash in on a massively overpriced stock, lmao
enterprise buy 200k tesla car this week please
&gt Elon Musk is a billionaire who has built several successful companies, including Tesla and SpaceX. He was born in South Africa but moved to Canada at the age of 17.
LMAO I already know Tesla call holders creating multiple accs to vote no
For those unaware, Elon posted a poll asking if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock and that he will abide by the poll results. That's over $20 billion in shares he might sell because of twitter.     https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088
imagine 1 twitter poll deciding 20B worth of Tesla stock being dumped
welp looks like Elon is selling 10% of his tesla stock, good luck tesla call holders
Okay but how many of us are gonna jump in if there‚Äôs a huge dip on Monday ? I would love to get in on a huge Tesla drop
Elon saw Pelosi had Tesla calls and said not today
Fuck, and I just bought more tesla stock. How fucked am I?
Tesla call and shareholders on twitter refreshing every 5 seconds.
Lcid,  Tesla,nio,plug,fcel, are the only things I can think of right now
He was one of the worst public speakers I had heard up until that point, he was given a 20 minute slot on the program and spoke (clearly impromptu) for about three minutes about how today‚Äôs technology would have been considered witchcraft.  Then he stopped and sat down and everyone just kinda looked around like wtf.  I did get my folks to invest a bit in Tesla that week which was legit.
Yeah she totally didn't tell him to buy 500k of itm calls of tesla last year.'
JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, many big businesses like Tesla and Visa and now countries are buying in on the "scheme". Enjoy sitting on the sideline.
tesla amazon prime delivery vans? lol
IMAGINE TESLA DELIVERY VANS...ü§®
Tesla still has room to grow I believe. I think after the news that Hertz, Uber, Lift, Avis, and others have released, it showed the now demand for electric cars are beyond anything we can currently supply. It would not surprise me at all if it were to hit $1400-$1500 by the end of the year.
Probably mad rich after investing in both Amazon and Tesla on inside information he heard from the table next to him
Tesla should go up but don't expect another insane rally Lucid rally might be extended Spy will continue hitting all time highsAnd fuk Michael burry
Let's see.. 4.5 billion purchase from hertz gave tesla about 200B in market cap, 7.5B should give it about 333B more which should rocket it past 1500. You're all good, the DD is as solid as the hype.
There was an interesting quote from Panasonic in this article.https://insideevs.com/news/545593/panasonic-progress-tesla-4680-cells/&gt But we won't rule out the possibility of branching out to other companies that share our values if we can do so without overextending our resources.It makes it sound like Panasonic has maxed out their production capacity. So they can only take on new customers if they can expand their production capabilities.
&gt but build quality is so much better than Tesla.Well, build quality *of prototypes and press cars* is so much better than Tesla. It remains to be seen what the quality of their mass produced vehicles will be.I do expect it to be a better vehicle than the Cybertruck (by a lot) or Ford Lightning (by a little) ... *but* having a better vehicle doesn't always translate to higher sales volume. Tesla does have a huge brand awareness and press awareness advantage over Rivian ... and Ford is just going to blow both of them out of the water when it comes to actual sales volume on electric trucks. I expect to see 20-50 Lightnings sold for every Rivian or Cybertruck.
Agree. Will be interesting to see if GM and Ford can ever come up with a way to be competitive on talent acquisition so they stop bleeding out their best EV centered employees. Right now they are still compensating like old school engineering companies, whereas Rivian and Tesla are moreso compensating like tech companies. They certainly don‚Äôt have location going for them either. I recently saw GM trying to hire entry level software engineers at $65-67k..It‚Äôs only going to get harder and harder for them to compete if they can‚Äôt hang on to anybody
No that was the Tesla $50 strike puts in December guy
Not saying you‚Äôre wrong about what Tesla is doing today, but compare Lucid to Tesla in 2009. Their car was the $110k roadster. That‚Äôs $140k in today‚Äôs dollars. The Model S which didn‚Äôt arrive until 3 years later had a base price of $56,400 ($74k in today‚Äôs dollars). Pretty dead on comparable to Lucid‚Äôs offerings
Not me.  I hate Lucid.  They're aiming for a high end market that does and will continue to have other high end offerings (think Audi and Porsche), and they're saying "don't buy theirs, buy ours" literally in the face of someone like Porsche.  It's a bad play for a small market space.Sure, Tesla had a sort of premium product, but they were also playing in a market space that had nobody at all.  They were the only thing around in this new space.  So effectively Tesla's success is a visualization of ALL the people remotely interested within that market niche.  They got the whole pie and still nearly went broke and lost everything.  Lucid very much does not have that level of availability of market interest.  Lucid made a really bad choice.Rivian is different in that they focused hard on the two big mainstream market spaces, SUVs and trucks.  They are slightly unlucky with timing since brands like Ford are starting to roll some products into these market spaces, but just a couple years ago, there was no choice in EV for SUVs or trucks.  Rivian is also being relatively normal in styling and construction so they will be easily understood and received.  And they are staying relatively affordable so much of the mainstream actually has the means to own one.  Rivian is pricing their truck right in the middle of Ford's Lightning cost range.  The Rivian SUV might compete somewhat with the Mach-E, and again, pricing is relatively comparable.  They're hitting the right marks to make a big splash.  The only thing Rivian can do wrong is fuck up the business side of it, and so far they're progressing in a way that seems pretty professional.Rivian's doing it right.  Lucid is being stupid.  And Telsa just hit the market space first and has had a lot of years to establish itself.  But, Telsa is now at the peak.  The EV market will continue to get flooded from every automaker, and it's going to eat heavily into their market share.  It's going to become a tight, lean race.
Which is literally the exact way Tesla started, and Lucid also plans to sell trimmed down cheaper models as they expand, but how are they different from Tesla? Right now, just the range.
Lol knockoff tesla? They arnt even competing for the same consumers. Ones a luxury car with much higher build quality.
55B valuation, ~200 delivered so far, 50k truck and SUV preorders, 100k amazon delivery van preorders, unique market segments. Gets shit on by WSB. Meanwhile, Lucid passed $60B today with less than 20 delivered, 7500 preorders, over priced #basic Tesla knockoff with a bit better range, and many on WSB are tripping over themselves to buy Lucid lol
Risk management, lololololo.  Here's what happens to me:  I make like $5,000 on some calls and everything is looking great and then I make the next play and lose like $4999 and I'm right back to where I was before, sometimes worse.I bought Nikola calls this week because they were CHEAP.  Also bought 300 actual shares of Worksport.  I made a few hundred bucks off Tesla this week, which honestly was not that easy, and same for AMZN--fucking volatile as hell that shit is and it's expensive, too.I'm sure the RIVN IPO is going to be a huge success with lots of limit up halts and shit like that.  It's going to be DWAC all over again.
work like a dog. put every spare dollar into conviction-play stocks. get married then get divorced quickly and childless. have no time to go out and spend money. refuse every notion of buying a house when everyone my age is buying their second property. recognize weapons-grade autism in elon musk and sell every other stock to invest into his only public company. drive its product daily as FUD defense. recognize GME opportunity and get on the ü¶ßüöÄ. rotate back to Tesla after moon trip. join theta gang and sell 5-12 DTE options weekly for passive returns. thanks never took the time to write it out before and now i have.
Am I your dad? lol I graduated with a degree in finance around the same time. My view on investments is similar to a famous Warren Buffett line. Why would you hold something for 10 seconds that you're not willing to hold for 10 years. Invest for the long term. Had I done that early on I probably could retire now in my early 30s. I had hundreds of Netflix, Amazon and Tesla shares in 2010 and sold them. I sold Netflix for a loss. ($900 loss) at the time but those investments would have multiplied and been worth so much money today. No one can know the future. You will make mistakes and it might take a while to recover but learn from them and always keep thinking and looking out for opportunities.
Actually according to another retard the top 3 stocks have been on average massive gainers  like gme tesla and nvidia. Other then that theres a 50 50 chance of profit. If youd beleive it
Say them on the highway a few months ago. They were in town doing a photo shoot.  They look awesome.  There were 3 of the top line model all camouflage style just chillin driving speed limit on highway. Drivers all had two hands on the wheel and sitting straight up. I can easily see this stock as the 2nd best EV.  Way more stylish than any Tesla atm.
Sold 10k worth of Tesla today at 1234. Happy to finally take a little profit so I can finish building my mustang.
Dude... I sold tesla to buy more GME... I've never been more jealous of anything in my entire life. Diamond hands on GME tho w
Why did my Tesla $1300 call expiring today expire worthless? I was told Tesla to $1300 this week for sure.
Not convinced. I don‚Äôt like BBBY‚Äôs fundamentals, so my main issue with the OP‚Äôs thesis is the fundamental value. On WSB, though, nobody cares about fundamentals. The stock is way up today after Citron report. Buybacks as an alternative to dividends make sense when they come out of a positive cash flow/profitability landscape. Otherwise, they‚Äôre just gimmicks to a fundamentals/value focused investor like me. Stock buybacks do keep the Tusserians away, though, so there‚Äôs that.FD, I thought Tesla was way overvalued at $600. So what do I know.
The biggest 6 companies of the S&ampP 500 make up nearly a quarter of the index. Tesla is something like 3%. So it does weigh.&amp#x200Bhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-drives-up-s-p-500s-disruptive-tech-exposure-as-the-index-rides-to-record-highs-in-october-11635361789
If Tesla doesn‚Äôt workout, $BABA will cover any losses by a long shot. But yes, long BABA short TSLA
If the rest of the market crashed and dropped 20% in a day Tesla would just be up 5%.
There is the new tech dream, however:  The dreams of Tesla (everyone driving electric cars) and NVidia (AI chips everywhere), justifying 100+ P/ENot to mention now Meta: Second Life / Ready Player One with trillion dollar valuations
The truth, I had an account I forgot about show up and decided the next meme I see I would buy into and BB popped up so I hopped on at about $11 and it ran to $26 that week...doubled a forgotten account in a week and now it is double again thanks to Tesla.
Tesla ur embarrassing me Infront of other tech stocks
Please let it crash, so I can buy Tesla at $100 per share
 Can we please one day get biden to start tweeting like mango ‚Äú wow great job numbers ‚Äú ‚Äú Tesla new all time high thanks to my policies ‚Äú
Draftkings shitting the bed on earnings too.The past couple weeks, outside of Tesla, has been an absolute mess for earnings calls. Cathie wood getting her dentures kicked in.
&gt The electric car company Tesla has announced that it will be building a factory in Shanghai. It is currently the largest foreign-owned manufacturing facility in China and produces its Model 3 sedan.
I don‚Äôt give a shit if UAW squeezes Biden‚Äôs nuts to get an extra $4500. (1) Tesla can still win on price flexibility given margins and (2) It‚Äôs all about scaling rn. Austin factory is going to kick model Y out the door at light speed and an $8000 subsidy is going to be the key that obliterates ICE crossover sales over the next two years. No joke I‚Äôm literally selling my wife‚Äôs 2020 rav4 and leasing something so we don‚Äôt get osborned
I only need Tesla to be up 15% today for my calls to be ITM ü§°
Tesla can not be stopped
hell yeah Tesla finally moving a bit, bullish PM i hope
Long term the only problem with the company is the valuation, people love their products but do enough people love them to be a multi-billion dollar business, I think the answer is NO. Their best hope is a takeover by another gym brand or someone else in the health niche. If they can shift enough bikes and move to profitability, they will survive long term, but their shares are going to look more like GoPro than Apple or Tesla.
It‚Äôs literally what I said, Tesla moves those numbers in it‚Äôs sleep. Lol you really trying to prove something üòÇ
The value of an option has built into the price implied volatility. So if most people are confident Tesla will hit $1500 within 6 months then the option is expensive even if it‚Äôs not close because it‚Äôs assumed it will and thus the options go for a high premium. But if news comes that causes that confident to decline for example they announce they lost a huge deal. The stock doesn‚Äôt even need to drop for the option to crash because the confidence of Tesla hitting $1500 could decline and thus crash the option value. Sorry it‚Äôs late but that‚Äôs a rough example
The reason is because Tesla moving that much isn‚Äôt that absurd so people value it higher because it‚Äôs implied Tesla can easily move that fast. Vs if you said any other company moving 80% in 3 months it‚Äôll be cheap because it never happens. Tesla does thst in its sleep
They also sell like 11,983 cars for every Tesla lunch break. So there's that.
Easiest way to start is either long calls meaning long term bets so you are safe. So you could be playing with 100 Tesla shares for a fraction of the price. If you believe it‚Äôll rise over time. OR easiest way to start is buying options near announcements and quarterly reports. If the news is good and it jumps 3-10% you will gain a decent amount on the option. 10% on a stock is roughly 100%+ on the option.
I rode in the new f-150 lightning on a test track run, it‚Äôs impressive. It‚Äôs gonna have a nice big market and be fun to drive and it‚Äôs a Ford, it‚Äôs gonna have huge aftermarket support and appeal compared to Tesla. I think f-150 will win over a lot of folks who can‚Äôt stand Elon musk or Tesla since it‚Äôs a lot less pretentious and is being presented as a workhorse truck, not a luxury vehicle or mall crawler (even though there will be trim levels for those customers). The new Mach-E isn‚Äôt terrible either (it‚Äôs more appealing than the Bolt) and I think Ford is making good choices to appeal to the EV crowd without alienating their IC customers.
I'm thinking of doing some long Ford calls, maybe $30 a year from now. I have no particular reason to believe Ford will pump like this other than the fact that Tesla already pumped to an insane degree and I believe the market in its autism will lead other car companies to do something similar in turn.
Tesla raising prices in response to EV credits. The more you subsidize something the higher the prices. Don‚Äôt believe me, look at college tuition.
Didn‚Äôt opinion is unpopular do a ban bet yesterday that tesla was gonna go down to 1k?
If I had $20 for every IPO that goes down the drain as soon as it‚Äôs listed, I‚Äôd have a Tesla share by now. The only exception I can honestly remember may be RBLX
Elon announcing tomorrow that the first SpaceX trip to the moon will be with a Tesla lunar rover on board. (I‚Äôm starting the rumor now.)
Tesla increasing prices again. Bullish as fuck. Take note peloton ü§°
Thank you. You're the only one who gave a serious answer.Anyways, now that my Tesla battery is fried, I can declare bankruptcy.
I love Bears when Tesla dips, they come out of their caves and disappear before the bell rings like vampires.
It turns out there are a *lot* more variables involved with **safe** self driving cars than initially thought.One good example I know, as it's tangential to my field, is computer vision. Two things stand out immediately, the biggest being the dynamic range of a modern CCD vs. the dynamic range of the human eye. Even a really good HDR camera is only half a god as the human eye *at best* when discerning objects across exposure fields in the same frame, and takes *significantly* longer to do so video is much worse. Cameras are going to have to improve *significantly* to be able to do the same job the human eye does across all lighting conditions.The second big thing that jumps out is 3D reconstruction. The human brain, and really the brain of any animal with binocular vision, is exceedingly good at reconstructing spatial data from two data points within a fraction of a second. Meanwhile, purpose-built computers struggle to reconstruct a small area in 3D with hundreds of data points, and *really* struggle with very thin objects like paper, leaves, and **Street signs**, or very smooth and reflective surfaces like puddles, ice,  **other cars** and **street signs**. As you might imagine, such reconstruction is vital to successfully navigating in a real-world environment and while technology like lidar and sonar can help, it still requires a fairly large and generally unchanging 3D map be constructed beforehand, and even small changes over a short period can really throw the computer off. Just watch a Tesla struggle removing itself from a parking space and consider how many close calls it has (or how many times it miss judges and does collide).And that's just two of the big items I know of. There are lots of ways for driving situations to change or go very bad that while humans may not be great at handling either, we're still far better at it than a computer cluster. We'll get there, it just turned out to be way more complicated than anyone envisioned.
Tesla baby what is u doin
Wait someone actually shorted Tesla? Who? I need the ~~loss porn~~ strategic avoidance lessons
She's not a retail trader though. When you have hundreds of millions of dollars in a stock and it goes up a lot you need to pare down to control risk. Yeah, in hindsight she should have held, but you don't know it when you're in the trenches.  If Tesla tanked and she held you'd all be in here hootin and hollerin about her bag holding. A lot has to do with risk management of a fund.  But this is WSB where risk management doesn't exist.
Tesla stock started really going off after my DD about how the car is engineered for blowjobs.
Tomorrow I expect PTON announce they are buying 10000 Tesla
Ya it‚Äôs kinda funny how wsb complained about her husband buying calls on Tesla months ago and couple days ago celebrating tsla hitting 1k.Lol these guys made pelosi rich as f from that I bet.
Here's the story...She left her husband for a gamestop or Tesla dude who said if she wants to lose weight,  they'll just buy her a Brazilian butt lift, LOL ü§£üòÇüòÑ
Tesla gains 500b in market cap off the announcement ![img](emote|t5_2th52|5957)
Peloton's business plan got leaked."Let's glue iPads to exercise bikes and sell them for $4k to see how many of them we can sell. It worked for Tesla when they glued iPads to their cars."
It's just parts.  Ford re-tools every line, ever year. They are highly experienced in modifying their production line quickly and with minimal downtime, even when it comes to introducing brand new models.  To further things, the F150 electric truck uses the *existing bodyframe* of the F150.  The amount of re-tooling to incorporate their EV infrastructure is significantly less complicated than Tesla's creating a new model.Tesla has made 6 different consumer vehicles, in 13 years.  Ford makes 10+ new models every year.
imagine if it was literally tesla themselves just repeatedly selling puts to raise capital. what a meme that would be
The e-Tron's are fucking sweet 10/10 would take one over Tesla. Tesla's electronics are cool but IMO in no way luxurious, stylish, or affordable (for most people). There will be car makers that fill the need for cheaper EV's and others for luxury EV's. They are already losing global market share.
Guy is selling shares short, not buying options. If Tesla doesn't drop back below 1000, but instead consolidates at the current level, he's in the hole forever. It's not like being long a viable company, where you can wait it out in a long enough timeframe.
Eh... not really.  This guys strategy isn't terrible.  Thesis is that Tesla is ready for a quick sharp correction that can be capitalized on, but its difficult to predict exactly what.  So instead of dropping all the tendies at once, choose entries up front and set expectations of wht you're willing to lose so you don't freak the fuck out and change up the play halfway through.Tesla has corrected in the past, harshly.  Its rebounded, but this isn't a long play.  It's assuming that even if TSLA continues there's significant room for a 10-20% drop before continuing.  No one is suggesting TSLA is worthless or should be naked shorted.  He's buying puts, which doesn't put anyone at risk of losing money they don't have.Guy's strategy is ballsy with TSLA, but has real potential.  If I had money and balls I'd be tempted to follow along.
Cathie makes 20% loss on minor position while Tesla rips into infinity. Don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs too worried about a couple losers.
You can short a Tesla by connecting the positive terminal to the negative terminal.
It has to. Either that or stagnate until it's valuations matches the value.Either way, it's not smart to short tesla. It's price is irrational and i doubt anyone can accurately predict anything about it other than retards buying more
One thing the market is seriously overlooking right now on the EV side is access to natural resources.  Benchmark minerals is forecasting severe deficits of lithium, graphite, cobalt, and nickel over the next decade.As usual, Tesla is one step ahead, having locked up supply with the likes of Ganfeng, Piedmont, and Prony.  Some of these legacy auto manufacturers are going to find themselves up a creek when they try to transition to EVs and find there are no raw materials to be had.
Tesla call holders feelin like the second prettiest girl watching NVDA get all the attention.
Pelosi has tesla and nvidia calls üòÇüòÇüòÇSheeshhhh. Going all in on her next trade
The Tesla hype is so strong that Ford is getting a boost from the crumbs
Tesla is great at making cool and fun tech. But the big automakers are better at making cars. They just need to wake up a little bit and make their cars more fun. I remember when the Ram came out with a 14 inch screen. They had a whole commercial bragging about that dumb screen because it was the biggest in class. This was after teslas we‚Äôre already out with massive screens. They just don‚Äôt get it. People likely shiny neat stuff.
Comparing an escape to a Tesla? Lol not trying to make fun at your expense, but have u tried the EV mustang? May get you closer to the feel u are looking for
Tesla alllllmost went bankrupt due to model 3 production woes and they had years of experience with the model S. Time will tell.
Tesla has been overvalued since I bought in at 2016. It's my favorite overvalued stock ever
No way they're late. They can scale a hell of a lot better than tesla and are ahead of other legacy automakers.
I think if large manufacturers can actually deliver an electric car at around $35k with decent range we will see a massive boom.I‚Äôm expecting downvotes but Tesla is a crappy brand for me. Most manufacturers make it very easy to buy parts, Tesla not so much. Additionally, for the price you pay the QC issues bother me. Every Tesla I see has weird uneven gaps. TFL waited 6+ months for parts after accident. This is not acceptable for me.Also, in reality electric cars are not attainable for average American right now. Plus, many people are trying to wait out the current craziness in the car market.
According to the valuation of all the startups next to Tesla, we will all own a couple of cars each. More seriously, I think lots of EV startups will either fail or get acquired by current OEMs to solidify/accelerate their EV portfolio. I think legacy automakers have an edge for high volume quality assembly lines.Edit: ride sharing can only work in high density cities. People will still buy cars 10-20 years from now
I agree with you, so many auto manufacturers are coming with their own version which means less sales for Tesla. They may be the leader today but tomorrow, people have choices. Leading doesn‚Äôt mean shit in the long run. Look at BB, they were the coolest thing at one point and time, but when newer and cooler stuff comes out eg. iPhone, and android phone. Practically killed their phone. When they tried to follow suit to take back some of their market share, it was too late. You must be a retard to buy at these prices, I think one day there will be a epic downward spiral once people see it moving down and prefer to take their profits. Will it happen tomorrow, probably not, next year? Maybe within 5 years. Pretty certain. Market has been on a long ass bull run, it‚Äôs going to end sooner or later.
&gt Tesla is a fraud.
TSLA is squeezing to $1337 a share and next week when this price hits, Elon will likely tweet 'lol 1337 dude.'  Once his tweet is seen by his millions of followers and apes, the stock will rocket to $1420.69 a share.  He will then tweet 'thinking of taking Tesla private at $1420.69 a share.'  I blew my YOLOad on into $1335c and $1420c for next week.  Good luck to all!

Logic doesn't apply with Tesla valuation anymore. Just enjoy the ride until it's over.
Only reason investors have tolerated such high P/Es is the future potential. Once Tesla is an established company, the P/E will drastically fall down to the level of blue chip stocks. So your calculation is VERY optimistic
People are buying Tesla for a few years from now. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla\_is\_still\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otwk5v/tsla_is_still_undervalued/)&amp#x200BWith Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year. So let's assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year.    3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings.    How about with $8,000 per car?    =$24Billion    $24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap    How about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA's stock.    $24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.        Let's try that again for 2028    Assume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors.    This gives an annual earnings of $72B.        ((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc.    \-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost.    $120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit.    \-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))        A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T    This would be a stock price around $2200 per share.    If Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner.
I never disclosed of any position in Tesla
But it‚Äôs Tesla
Tesla is an enigma. It‚Äôs not just a car company. They are disrupting the auto market, and are the only ones who will be able to meet at scale the tidal wave of demand for EV‚Äôs. Their grid energy storage market will explode, they‚Äôll also get revenue from auto bidder - an ai software to sell back stored energy to the grid, so they‚Äôll be a utility company. Guess what they‚Äôve been doing for years? Selling solar panels, batteries to homes. With a software update, you can opt in to sell your surplus solar to the grid. Fuck net metering, you‚Äôll join their virtual power plant and earn money. The FSD will be licensed to other car companies, they‚Äôll be like a Netflix with subscription revenue coming in. In 5-10 years, the billion dollar roofing market will get flipped on its tits when most new houses use Tesla solar tiles instead of asfault shingles. And don‚Äôt forget they‚Äôre already bigger than any gas station chain with their supercharger network already. They‚Äôre increasing that by 50% every year and once they open that up to all EV‚Äôs, range anxiety will subside and their demand will go even higher. They are a software company that happens to make cars.Yes, I want to have elons babies.
what the hell were you thinking buying puts on tesla.
there are so many source of revenute for Tesla that people really can't grasp the amount of money Tesla is going to make. People is sleeping about Dojo and AI as a service, about the Supercharger network open to everyone, about the insurance to all Tesla veichles, about robotaxi fleet, about renting FDS, about selling FSD to competitors, about being the largest battery maker in a world that is going to run on batteries only in some decades,  about Tesla Energy and their Autobidder software and, obviously later on, about Teslabot
Tesla pushes out gimmicky cars now like the plaid that 99% of people can‚Äôt afford to then sell you a model 3 with absolutely horrendous build quality. I feel like other car manufacturers will start producing more affordable EVS with the same range. At the end of the day 99% of people don‚Äôt care about their cars 0-60 (coming from an car enthusiast) but the price. If I can get a model 3 LR for 50k or Toyota produces a matching range ev for 45k plus a tax credit since Tesla no longer has them. Guess which one I‚Äôm taking? Not the Tesla because it makes ‚Äúelectric self driving cars‚Äù but the Toyota because hey, this brand has been making reliable sensible cars for decades, so I expect nothing less. I assume Tesla will shift into a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù brand and so will it‚Äôs price point and as more manufacturers produce more evs you will see more of nissan, Toyota, etc. like you said electrifying cars is inevitable and if you think Tesla will remain shareholder number 1 I doubt it.
I will never understand Tesla.... like who looks at this price and thinks... yeah, looks like a good play.
Never going to try and short Tesla again. Just doesn‚Äôt work. Even if it was $2000 today people would still buy. I shall take my loss and go suck Elon‚Äôs cock for forgiveness.
Tesla is consolidating to either run up or down and my calls would like to know which one soon
I refuse to bet against Tesla.
You buy Tesla stock for making $.You buy a Toyota to drive. 20 years later, it still works.As a former Tesla long that a made killing, I wouldn‚Äôt buy at these stock prices, never know when the epic crash will occur.
Is Tesla overvalued at the moment? Yes.Would I spend a single dime shorting this stock? No.I think that explains this stock‚Äòs dynamic quite well.
I am a tesla cultist and i am not selling. Holding it for the lolz
It ain‚Äôt about timing the top, the end of the literal valuation road for Tesla is coming. Soon, it will be up there with Apple, Amazon, and Google. Companies that make an absolute fuck load of money to justify their caps. While Tesla hardly makes any, and would literally have to steal 100% of car market to even be close
Anyone who thinks Toyotas battery tech isn't amazing is a fucking moron.Toyotas a big ship, but its slowly turning onto the EV game, and the cars are way better quality than Teslas rattle boxes too.Good on ya to everyone who made money off tesla, but fuck me I don't understand how anyone thinks it can be worth that much.
Puts on Tesla ? With all this good news, you are crazy. If any big money buys puts, retail will hang them out to dry lol. Tesla's running. Hard to time the top right now.
Tesla Ford gang gang
Tesla 1420.69 then 1800 then 2k and split ‚Ä¶..this is the way .
Never bet against the Tesla cultists. They won‚Äôt sell
You're saying I should short Tesla with my life savings? I'm retard I can't understand
Whenever i feel depressed i just look at [my cost basis on Tesla ](https://imgur.com/a/zIe980W)
If all you care about is reliability then sure, a Toyota is better in that regard. But a Tesla is about 1000x more interesting to own. My Corolla sized car puts down 495HP and has 500lb ft of torque at launch and draws its interpretation of the world on the screen.During the worst months of COVID we regularly got takeout and ate in the car watching YouTube and shows on Netflix with the AC/heat on.Now if you told me I had to own a car for 20 years then yeah the Toyota might last longer. But then if you‚Äôre into sure and boring things why the fuck are you even on wallstreetbets? Live dangerously, buy that Tesla lol.
For a brief moment tesla was just $1234.56

Lol Tesla nvr ever goes down
People that didn't give a fuck about the environment were happy to stuff their cats with child-slave conflict minerals and use 100% fossil power. But they can't stand anyone challenging their points of view, so once EVs start popping up, suddenly they're a passive-aggressive armchair expert about environmental damage, and they're livid about your batteries and that EVs still use a minority of fossil fuels to power them. "Your Tesla is plugged into the grid which used 30% fossil fuels ergo you're just a fake hippie and somehow worse than me using 100% fossil". Morons. There are genuine criticisms of EVs, but you need to hold ICE to the same standard, otherwise you're just a fuckhead trying to spread disinformation.
I can sense lord musk fingering the Tesla stock split clit boys here we cum ~~~

Theta can't fuck up my Tesla calls I bought 1300 calls cheap asf for 60$ lmao. The only way Theta gets me is if we take a big shit today!
Good god. Tesla is unstoppable
Just a reminder that Tesla had 38 Billion in shorts on it before the run up. The largest short position in the history of the stock market. Not to mention that if Tesla gets one more credit upgrade Mutual Funds will be able to purchase it at investment grade credit levels.
Only ü§° buying Tesla right now
Guess I should have held onto that Tesla call. Ha. Crazy
My 1300 tesla calls already up 20% since I bought them cheap during the dip. I'm holding till Friday. Wish me luck lmaooo godspeed retard here
"and none of these legacy automakers will be producing EVs at a rate needed."I mean, as per August YTD market share of the European EV market was VW Group (25%), Stellantis (14%), BMW (11%), Daimler (9%) and Hyundai (9%)... Tesla is at 6%.The idea that EV producers are lagging behind is a myopic American conceit which ignores the fact that in Europe hybrids have been popular for yonks and many other manufacturers have been experimenting with battery tech for decades (VW Group comes to mind). These groups have enough tech, they have established suppliers of raw materials, they have convertible capacity and they have established brands, pretending as if this isn't going to mean that they retain a substantial market share in the future is just silly.
Last time Tesla stock split at $1374.
Lmaoo no one can explain why Tesla is pumping rn üòÇüòÇüòÇAside from FOMO and profit chasing. Should be a fun day for Tessie.
I would genuinely hate to be a fund manager right now. Everything you've learnt about finance, the fundamentals, earning calls, trends, endless data analytics.  And some retard on a broken android is up 3000% this year from Tesla calls while you're down 23% thanks to a slow Covid-19 recovery.
I've NEVER seen anything Tesla related below $1
I think this right here is why people don‚Äôt understand Tesla‚Äôs valuation. It has nothing to do with automaker value, quality, or even profit lines. People want to be a part of Tesla. If tesla releases a phone - people are buying it, some digital coin - people are buying it, some new toy, and certainly any model of car/truck (even if it looks ludicrous) - people are buying it. This goes for the stock as well. Anyone who wants any Toyota model over a Tesla right now just doesn‚Äôt get it (or maybe is nostalgic about the Supra). Sucks to spend all that money on a Supra though just to get smoked by a performance Tesla 3. At least it can keep up with the base 3 or the 2013 model s though.
Why are there so many OF girls lurkin here? No one here has money to spend on you. They‚Äôd rather buy 11/5 Tesla 2000c
Been holding Tesla for 8 years, before it was cool
If tesla hits $2000 I‚Äôll have sex with my wife
Both Toyota and Daimler were initial investors in Tesla
My personal price target for Tesla is one million dollars. I found this by taking the current stock price and adding approximately one million dollars.
At one point, Tesla allowed Toyota to put the early battery packs in Rav4s I think it was 2012-2014. Most of them never made it out of California. Toyota scrapped the entire project because it could not gain traction since the electric RAV4 was something like $10,000 more then the gas RAV4. After that, Toyota made it known they had zero interest in EVs. They are dirt cheap for sale online but are basically worthless since Toyota and Tesla stopped producing parts for them.
Tesla is about to go parabolic tomorrow.
Tesla autopilot drove into an orphanage
Didn‚Äôt Toyota help Tesla at one point
TA on Tesla is useless when degenerate gamblers converge in a call buying orgy
Why didn‚Äôt I join Tesla gang sooner? Now that I‚Äôm in I‚Äôm sorry if it tanks tomorrow
Good lord Tesla is a beast
People that short/buy puts on Tesla must get turned on by pain
$tesla ripping ass tomorrow or what?
so imagine a best case scenario where every other manufacturer sits on their ass and doesnt build EV's. Tesla gets a 100% market share. How much should tesla be worth then? As much as the combined manufacturers who currently make up 99% of the market? Tesla is already worth more than them combined
The old companies that are currently selling more EVs than Tesla? Those companies?
So tesla tomorrow 1300 ?

&gt	I won‚Äôt buy TSLA at $1K/share.But, I won‚Äôt short it either.This is pretty much my sentiment. TSLA (the stock) is irrational at this point. However the potential for even bigger irrationality is also very much a big presence still.I‚Äôve been a Tesla fan since the beginning, and I‚Äôm just waiting (if ever) for the stock to tank so I can re-enter. I sold way too early.
Tesla is up +50% in one month. What the actual fuck.

I'm glad you posted this because it's critical that people are at least aware of fundamentals, even if they ignore them in favor of hyping up an overvalued stock. There's far too much delusion in here that these meme stocks are actually worth 1300x their profit margin, or that somehow their market cap will become 10x the total GDP of the entire United States within the decade. And it's caused a man to become the richest person on the planet through a company with only $42 billion in revenue which barely even cracks the top 100 list of companies.And there is FAR too much delusion that the other automakers aren't going to ever get their shit together catch up. Like they'll just hang back, keep having to buy EV credits at a wild cost, and let themselves lose 10% of the market share to Tesla.
P/E ratio is not a valid metric for a growing company, as you rightfully pointed out. However, there IS a valid metric for a growing company, which is the Price to Sales ratio ratio of the share price to the total amount of sales they have made. Even if a company is aggressively investing in expansion resulting in a negative earnings per share, price to sales will still be a valid metric.The P/S ratio of Amazon has a high of around 4. The P/S ratio of Tesla is around \~30. A crazy high P/S ratio is only feasible for tech companies due to the scalable nature of their product.
No, they do not currently make cells. There's a prototype cell facility at Kato road, but it doesn't make production cells at the moment, and no one knows for sure when that will happen. All of their other cells are sourced from CATL (LFP) or Panasonic (NMC).No cells currently made by either Panasonic or CATL are made with Tesla IP, and the joint venture relationship itself is not novel within the industry.
The problem with the stock market (well, the problem with WSB) is that most people think quarterly results matter. I remember watching a talk by daddy Bezos where he was basically like "whatever the stock price is today, that price was set by decisions we made 3-5 years ago or more. I can play games to make the stock look higher today, but that will lower the value in the future 3-5 years from now."Looking at this "Tesla has 1% of annual car sales" that's actually a fantastically good sign when you consider 5 years ago they produced 50,000 cars a year. And going from 50,000/year to 200,000/year to half a million a year this year... if you consider that they are making decisions today... it's not crazy to suggest they could be making millions of cars every year by 2025. That's what the stock is priced on.
People that think Tesla has some insane advantage over companies like Toyota have their hands fully inserted into Musk's ass. Their vehicles routinely come in at the bottom of the pack in terms of quality and value. Toyota has just been waiting for the market to be accepting of the ev market and they will swoop in and eat Elon's lunch. It is painfully obvious.
Tesla makes money not cars duh its a money company
I know I want an EV.  I also know Tesla has increased prices for their cars three times in the last few weeks here in Canada.  As much as I want an EV I can't afford a Tesla.  I'm not even poor.  Or I wasn't until I started hanging with you guys.  I put my name in for an Ioniq 5 preorder.
There's two key secrets to how Musk runs his companies:* Give engineers difficult and interesting problems to solve* Let them solve themThere's not actually that many companies that do both of those. There's lots of companies with difficult problems to solve (how do we  make this phone $1 cheaper to build, or how do we design this engine to pass emissions standards when it gets tested) and there's companies with interesting problems to solve, but they typically don't actually let their engineers solve them. Most modern companies are strangled by layers and layers of middle management and everything either has to be designed by committee or signed off on by one "visionary" at the top. Anything you design and build will take years to see production and will get watered down and destroyed by cost cutting along the way.I had a friend who went to work for a "big 3" automaker out of college, and he designed a seat rail for a car. Which is actually interesting because it's a really important safety part, but he spent almost all his time in meetings or waiting for approvals from management or having to redesign stuff because some other group made a change that screwed something up. He said that's what it was like for all the new hirers in his department, just toiling away on something that had seemed completely pointless. He actually got a job at Tesla after 2 years and loved it even though he ended up working 60 hours weeks a lot of times because he was spending all that time doing interesting stuff. When he left for Tesla, that one part he'd spent 100% of his time working on, still hadn't made it in to a single production car.And it's the same story at SpaceX. Both companies are attracting lots of very talented engineers, to work on interesting and complex problems. And then when they figure out the problem, they get to see it in production immediately. Often times you'll see very junior people, even interns, get to be responsible for actually making real changes and taking charge of projects if they're the ones that have the most hands on experience with it. Or if you're working on something and a supplier is dragging their heels or overcharging or just jerking you around, then they bring it in house and do it better themselves.You get to avoid like 95% of the soul crushing bullshit that makes most engineers hate their jobs. So Tesla and SpaceX attract talented people, who are willing to work hard and they let them work hard to solve important problems. And what's the result? They innovate way faster than anyone else in either industry.
They wont sell the Tesla Semi because its less efficient than diesel. The battery weight cuts into max cargo weight and the reduced range means anyone shipping will always buy a diesel first.Diesel semis last well over 1 million miles. The batteries in a Tesla semi last what, 7 years? Not going to replace diesel. Yet another one of Elon's bullshit ideas. Right up there with Hyperloop.
Don‚Äôt listen to these haters. I‚Äôm holding for long term for sure. I don‚Äôt care about pumping it up and getting it out all over social medias. It will grow into a very valuable stock in the future. Keep holding bro! When dudes posted in here years ago about Tesla they got the same responses
I mean it makes sense if they think that Tesla Vision can create high quality depth maps on par with LiDAR augmented systems, and they obviously think it can. Personally, I think a big part of it has to be the cost and work required to map every major road with LiDAR, no matter what Musk says are the reasons for not using it. Either way, I‚Äôm really curious to see how it all plays out. Can they beat Waymo and can Apple finally make some progress on it‚Äôs car project and have a part in this.
Will Tesla make its own batteries?  Tesla won't start mass production of its Semi until it can make its own battery cells, CEO Elon Musk said on an earnings call. The company said in a Q4 earnings update that it will deliver its first Semi by the end of 2021https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/tesla-semi-production-on-hold-until-company-can-make-its-own-batteries.html
This is just incorrect. The 2 best selling EVs in the world are both teslas. Tesla is the largest EV producer.
I think everyone else said most of what needed said and in more colorful language.I don't entirely understand how their partnership with Panasonic works, but since Tesla owns the factories for manufacturing the batteries, I assume Panasonic is probably producing custom batteries for Tesla using their proprietary designs. So you're probably half right about the manufacturing.Tesla definitely sells batteries though, so that part is just wrong.Btw, why is this topic something you feel is worth getting emotional about?
It doesn't make any sense. Vision based systems require algorithmic image recognition, which while tesla has done a great job, isn't perfect (as seen by the crashes into stationary emergency vehicles etc).A LiDAR system would make a distance map from obstacles without any need for image recognition, and would spot stationary obstacles nearly flawlessly. When combined with cameras, the system would be far more complete.
How expensive was that call? More than you can afford pal tesla.
I started saving for a Tesla January 2020, by buying shares monthly.  I couldn‚Äôt afford one then.  I can now.   67% return
They dont' sell batteries.  Holy shit, how has this persisted.They use Panasonic batteries.  Tesla modifies battery packs to ride redlines for performance.They don't make, produce, or sell betteries at all and NEVER will
I have a Tesla model S and it is indeed the best car I ever owned no doubt about that and in the fire Tesla will be huge. But a P/E ratio of 380 is like a lot like a really lot
Tesla is ABSOLUTELY not attracting top talent in any tech field. Under paying and over working engineering talent does not bring the best and brightest.
If LiDAR is the future, Tesla is fucked. Musk said LiDAR "is a fool's errand" and they removed radar from Model 3 and Y.
No longer using radar.  Just cameras collecting data for their neural net.   And Tesla is making a bet that it will be more effective than LIDAR, a technology they aren‚Äôt using at the moment in their quest for full level 5 autonomy.
Actually, Tesla's operating margin was 14.5% for the entire business. If you'd just look at the automotive department it'd be higher. GM is at 11% and they're one of the better ones in the market. Also GM is heavily trending downwards while Tesla is even more heavily trending upwards.
They also sell batteries and build giant battery warehouses for storing renewable energy.I think it would be most accurate to say they are something along the lines of an electric technology company.I don't know a lot about Tesla, but if, for example, they are selling their batteries or licensing patents to other car companies, all those negative arguments about their auto sales could actually be positives.(No idea if that's the case though)
Got a tesla $1200 11/19How fucked am I?Bought today morning
I still really hope Tesla will call their $25K car the Tesla Q.
Tesla will not be worth it's market capitalization anytime soon, probably never.
It's a conspiracy theory kind of sub. Everyone feeds each other's confirmation bias, Tesla is doing fraudulent accounting somehow and anyone who disagrees gets banned.
People have tracked the data uploaded by a Tesla.  It‚Äôs not much.  They are selling snake oil.
But Alphabet is even better at this than Tesla
The OP is longtime anti Tesla poster on another sub...that looks very tslaQ
if you own QQQ or SPY in wall street, yes, you are in the "cult" because they have tesla as a %.most 401ks are invested in QQQ or SPY in one way or another. so all 401ks and retirement accounts are now investing in TSLA.
Tesla net profit margin is 11.7%, GM is 9%You are actually retarded
Your second mistake is thinking that Tesla is a car company.
Really? In which sector do you think Tesla will have top marketshare?
Just bought a Tesla put so it‚Äôs going 1200 in a sec. Yw boys
The best way I've heard it described so far is "essentially a green ETF". I don't know the future, but Tesla has a good shot at being a ridiculously large company. Like Dutch East India company or Standard Oil size.
Model 3 didn‚Äôt reach volume production until late 2018, three years ago. Four years ago Tesla was struggling with falcon doors on the recently released model X.
Left Tesla for GME, I truly belong here
Potential may be limitless, but potential realization is finished. Tesla is valued more than the total market combined. I vote cult ...
"It is all priced in" ... basically the price now reflects the idea that tesla will dominate the world. Based on this, i do not understand how the valuation continues to grow. Tesla's valuation is completely irrational though.
Breaking:Gamestore ordered 100,000 tesla model3s
I hate Elon but it's because of his planet sized ego and attention whoring. I'll still defend SpaceX in a battle to the death though and I'll occasionally give credit where it's due on Tesla too. He might be a blowhard, but he can whip engineers into a design frenzy like nobody else alive it seems.Sometimes someone can be an egotistical piece of crap but still kinda be right about how great they're doing. It's annoying, but it seems to work so who am I to judge his methods?
I'll never understand people like that. It's ok to not like a company, but Tesla haters make it their entire world. It's just a sad way to live. (and a poor way to live)
Tesla gains are driven by retards who might secretly be big-brain-monkeys
Tesla is like my ex-wife.  I thought I understood it,  I didn't really understand it,  I lost a lot of money because of it,  I don't talk to it anymore.
people are just using Tesla to make money, no one cares if it's overvalued.
That shit don‚Äôt matter with Tesla been over valued for awhile now stock still goes up.
Was tesla really nowhere 4 years ago!? Elon Musk was the idol of reddit already ajd the model 3 had been released already too. His best seller biography had already been released for 2-3 years too.
I understand your point of view but this not gonna work üåàüêª . What is important in wallstreetbets is that Tesla is bringing all the tendies and printing a lot of üñ®üíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµüíµ . Thats all matters ‚úå
It‚Äôs about 50 people whose whole identity revolves around hating Musk. They are much more focused on SpaceX now that Tesla is profitable.
Tesla has high tech potential.They are innovative therefore valued higher.
Tesla 1420.69
Tesla renamed themselves from Tesla Motors, Inc in 2017 to Tesla, Inc... ever wonder why?
Last time Tesla rose this fast it fell by 150$ in March of this year.
It's just facts, tesla bears have lost gape loads of money with perfectly reasonably arguments like yours already
Hyundai plans to sell 560k BEVs in 2025. Tesla is on track for 4.5mil BEV sales. And Tesla has better margins to boot.
Should it? It's Tesla, who knows what it will do next.
Oh how many cars were sold?  Don‚Äôt bet against Tesla no matter what your stats say
Doesn't say they bet against Tesla. If they did though then the loss porn is coming
11000 units lol, Tesla is pumping out 200k a quarter and have more demand then the next one.
Wow.  Every manufacturer on there is more integrated than Tesla.  You've studied the auto industry properly right?  For example Tesla is allegedly the most advanced tech company yet still buys it's robotics...unlike some on the list.  Hyundai owns the ships it uses to transport it's cars...
People have been saying this for years bro. I wouldn't bet against Tesla.
6% of Tesla's revenues and dwarfed by the likes of LG, Samsung etc.  Tesla doesn't even make its own solar panels for crying out loud.
Tesla can't keep up with demand. Thats like 90% of the problem. We will see how your statement's hold up end of 2022 when giga Texas and giga Berlin are online.
I own Tesla stock and I honestly don‚Äôt know why it is valued this high but I guess I don‚Äôt mind lol
Show me.the tech Tesla sells unrelated to its cars?  waymo and Cruise starting to offer robo-taxis in US cities in 2022 unlike Tesla.  Daimler/Mitsubishi, Volvo etc already sell EV trucks.  BYD been fully making its own batteries for a  while unlike Tesla, etc, etc.
No, it isn't? There's a load of articles about it following their Q1 earnings, saying they made $518m revenue from emission credits which accounts for most of their profits. For comparison their total revenues were $10.4bn, and their gross profit was $2.2bn. That pegs carbon credits at 5% of their revenues, or ~25% of their gross profits.You could argue that carbon credits account for most of their income that quarter, but it's still a shitty sensationalist take, because it requires writing off the operational expenses against all the profits that weren't carbon credits, and none of it against the carbon credits. The most valid take would be "Tesla wouldn't have made much income if they didn't sell carbon credits". Instead when you google it the top article is this, [Tesla Made More Money Selling Credits and Bitcoin Than Cars](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a36266393/tesla-made-more-money-selling-credits-and-bitcoin-than-cars/), which is just an outright false title.Furthermore, the amount of carbon credits they're receiving has halved since then and their automotive profits have increased by about 50%. Carbon credits only accounted for like 2.5% of their revenue and 13.5% of their income last quarter.Also, they make EVs. Carbon credits should be a core part of their business. It isn't the gotcha that some journalists think it is. You could do the exact same thing with US domestic fossil fuel industry subsidies, agriculture subsidies or transport subsidies, but nobody does because it goes without saying and it isn't spicy.
Yet again, people mistakingly think Tesla is just a car company. It's so much more than that. But ok.
Detroit might be the worst city in America. Tesla 1300 11/5 calls.
looking at tesla daily chart gives me vertigo
35k in TSLA calls a week ago woulda been quite a few Teslas. Just had to buy TSLA before you buy a Tesla
Mom talking about buying the 35k Tesla on a loan.What 35k Tesla, mom? Elon stopped catering to the poor class üíÄ

If you've ever interviewed for Zillow or known engineers that work there, you'd laugh at how dumb of a comparison that is. Zillow is no Tesla, not by a longshot.
The implication is that Tesla would have sold those cars anyway for the same price regardless of whether the deal ever came to be.
I agree with your statement that Tesla is overvalued at this point, and many times so. Your criticism about Tesla is oversimplified though. Tesla is valued not as a car company but rather as a technology company. In fact, Tesla's strategy of vertical integration (manufacturing lot of things in house) gives them that much margin like you said 30% it is not about using less quality products, it is about vertical integration and innovative super efficient manufacturing techniques. Also, the less amount of parts you can use in a car the more margin you will have. Battery technology is the most expensive component in EVs. EVs require less number of parts than ICE vehicles. I think Tesla is priced not only as a car manufacturer but also as a technology and energy company combined. Tesla's energy business will be as big as it's automotive business in few years. Are you saying Tesla is not making any profit? If so, please go see their last quarterly report. With massive manufacturing ramp up in existing factories  and new factories like in Germany and Texas and the future new factories Tesla will dominate the industry in coming years. I agree one again it is over priced now.
I'm not justifying the valuation as I am in no way an expert. I am however somone who has worked in several industries that Tesla is touching on which might help shed some light on the larger than normal valuation.1. Solar city: Tesla owns one of the largest manufacturer, deployers, and owners of solar in the US, a market that is universally considered to be hugely important for energy generation going forward.2. Storage: Tesla produces more quality batteries than any single company in the world. Storage (batteries) is the single largest limiter to renewable energy, energy resilience, and in many cases human exploration of the unknown.3. Charging: Tesla has the largest deployment of chargers in the US. It's important to think of these chargers like owning a gas station.4. Mobility: Tesla has some of the strongest autonomous Mobility tech out there, which is increasingly becoming more of a tool to alleviate congestion and make car ownership obsoleteAll that to say, Tesla is not being valued as a car company. They are being valued as car company, a energy distribution company, a green energy company, an a electron storage company, and an autonomous vehicle company all at the same time.While a traditional manufacturer may produce more profit, or more cars. They don't also own the gas stations, they don't own oil refinery making the gas, and they don't own the guy driving the uber around.Tesla valuation is predicated on them owning the entire supply chain of electrons, and leveraging autonomous technology to eliminate the need for dealership and drivers. Now is that likely? I don't know. But it certainly makes Tesla more than just a car company.Just my 2 cents.
Tesla will soon be worth more than Google and in the next 10 years you'll see why. You'll be neurolinked to your tesla that's driving through a boring company tunnel with an internet connection via Star-link while your house charges on the Tesla  power grid and a Tesla bot takes out your trash and fucks your wife.
2/3rds of Tesla trading last week was a result of call options causing a gamma squeeze.
Tesla moon mission tomorrow
Also, back of the napkin math shows Tesla selling 15M vehicles at 35k average price and 35% profit margins is 183B in profit... Then you add $299 FSD with 50% take rate on 40M vehicles by 2027-28 and 90% margins is $65B in profit. Plus insurance with a 90% take rate $15b in profit. That is 263B in profit per year, yes profit by 2028. Valuation 20x profit is not unheard of. So that gives us 5.2T in 7 years
It pokes at the question:  What's the value of an EV maker?  Tesla, as of writing, is worth 1.3T.  Street forecasts put their 2022 Revenue at $71b.  That's 18x forward P/S.&amp#x200BRivian says in their S-1 that they have 50,000 preorders with $10k deposits -- we can assume they're all pretty serious about taking delivery.  They put their production capacity at up to 150,000 at their Normal, IL facility.   Let's say they can manage 30,000 cars next year with an ASP of $75,000.  That's $2.25b revenue, which equates to a forward sales of 17.8-22.2 at a $40b to $50b valuation.  That's... basically right in line with Tesla.  &amp#x200BIt's simultaneously absurd and in line with the industry average.
Funny you say that. I was just thinking Tesla stock reminds me of cryptocurrency. Forget father of doge, he already made Tesla.
What you're failing to understand is that the market is pricing in Tesla's submarine division. In the year 30XXX, the entire globe will be covered in water. Tesla will already have a head start as the country transitions to below sea level transportation. As you know, America is a driving country, so every American will need a submarine.
That's their target demographic, younger white males earning about 100,000 per year. Not the same audience as Ford truck and Toyota buyers. You don't magically become one when you buy a Tesla, that's not how this works.  Why be a Tesla fanboy if you don't  know the most basic things about the company???  From a few seconds on Google:&gtMales own 77% of Model S vehicles, and women own 23%. Women only own 16% of Model 3's, men own 84%. 88% of current Tesla Model S and X owners own their own home. That puts Tesla owners for these 2 models a full 21 to 24 percentage points higher for home ownership than the general population.&gtBased on data pulled from 2,650 Tesla owners, the average household income of a Tesla Model X owner is $143,177 per year. The average household income of a Tesla Model S owner is $153,313 per year. This compares to the United States national medium household income of $78,500.26 Jun 2021
Tesla cars aren't actually very high quality, their data lead is not in any way insurmountable, and I don't think there's much lock in or loyalty.  It's not a platform like apple. Either Tesla is insanely over valued, or something other than just the cars is driving the value. I'm quessing the former.  But as the popular saying goes, markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.
Tesla: We will be offering $10 Billion in new shares.-----/r/investing : I bought TSLA at $1200 and I will be holding for the next 50 years. Rest of my money is in VOO.-----/r/options : Put pricing still looks good. Will probably try to sell some. Buying calls may be risky but lots of upside with institutional volume. Hedge your longs and stay away from low delta.-----/r/stocks : I've been investing for only 6 months and I am up 30% on my portfolio. All my portfolio is in tech. Did I mention I'm only 18?-----/r/wallstreetbets : I will gargle my own piss and drink Lord Elon's cum if TSLA hits $1500 by end of week. Fuck me in my tight mouth daddy!
That would be true but I‚Äôve used autopilot and FSD and neither has gone 100 miles without requiring my input. So until Tesla proves it‚Äôs significantly safer than other manufacturers with accident avoidance, it‚Äôs just hype.
I have a model Y with FSD. The car is absolutely awesome to drive, but the FSD is total bullshit. They can't even manage a good adaptive cruise... it maintains a full 3 second following distance, and takes forever to realize when the road ahead is clear. My Subaru does way better on the adaptive cruise, and the lane keeping assist is not scary like the Tesla. The Tesla also will hard brake for no reason (on the freeway even) sometimes when the adaptive cruise is on.
I don't think you get apple level loyalty without apple-level quality.  You want to talk about brand loyalty?  What's going to happen when Ford and Toyota come out with electric trucks and cars?  Tesla buyers are wealthy white guys.  Ford trucks have a far wider appeal in the US market.  You can go anywhere on the planet and find loyal Toyota buyers, from wealthy  presidents to impoverished rebels.China has their own electric car giant, considering the way they run things, I don't think they're going to let Tesla ever dominate the world's biggest market when they have very good options being developed domestically.Tesla is facing serious competition over the next few years, it's extremely unlikely they just continue growing into a top 5 car company.  The reason there isn't more competition is because electric cars are just not very profitable.  Tesla would lose money on each car if it wasn't for ev credits. Bigger companies are going to be producing more electric vehicles as the technology matures and they can make them profitably.  I'm not sure what data a Tesla can collect that other cars and phones don't.
Yeah. That's my point! A PE of 15 might be reasonable for tesla.  Even a 10x drop in price still leaves it at a PE of 38 and seven times higher than the competition.
My paper hands bailed last week at $175 and moved into Tesla.I'm crazy.Not stupid.
I have a Tesla but there‚Äôs no apps or infrastructure locking me in. If VW had something similar in a year there‚Äôs no reason I‚Äôd need to keep the Tesla.
Tesla is valued like Elon is an alien from an advanced galaxy spanning civilization who is bringing unbeatable technology to Earth but he's just an alien from South Africa.
Tesla is increasing prices in the best environment for car prices in history.  Even if Tesla's margin was 30% higher than their competitors, it would be a 13% margin. You are giving crazy numbers to justify a crazy valuation. Tesla would essentially need to sell 20% of all vehicles (cars, trucks, vans, SUVs etc.) in both Europe and the US to get close to that 5,000,000 number. They would need to do that while still growing massively to justify the PE of 60. They would need to do that while ripping people off at historically high levels. They need the sales of a massive car company, make a 300% larger profit margin than all competitors, and grow at a rate that's about 10x of their competitors to justify these numbers.  And, they need to do that in 4-5 years while growing sales by 17x, cutting costs, and tripling profit margin. Really? What are the chances of Tesla actually doing that vs the chances of this actually being a bubble and Tesla not actually being worth more than all other car companies, plus all airplane manufacturing companies, plus Exxon.
&gtTesla is 5 years ahead in self driving techdisagreeWaymo seems to be way ahead. No wonder, Google actually is a proper AI company unlike Tesla and do know their stuff. (Google publishes a ton of AI research and a lot of Google products use AI, so they are already heavily invested in AI and have spent a lot of money on AI research)And although the added cost of the hardware is about 7.5k today, i don't doubt that they could bring that down significantly when going mass production. Waymo actually already tested fully autonomous taxis, which Tesla did not.They are way closer to a final product and could probably release an autonomous car way before Tesla could, once regulations allow it
Even the self driving is being pushed by GMs SuperCruise. Tesla is obviously overvalued, but good luck shorting it
VW is delivering more EVs this year than Tesla last year, 9 months behind and growing faster. https://electrek.co/2021/10/15/volkswagen-group-bev-delivery-numbers-still-a-year-behind-tesla-but-gaining-fast-at-138-yoy/
The tech side of Tesla is the data they're getting from their sales. They're the most popular EV/data collection car on the market. Meaning that each day they collect even more data than their competitors meaning that their future products can be even better and more refined. Aaand they'll have Apple levels of loyalty building up from all the people buying their cars at these early stages. So there's a product but their margins will go up as they have 1. Improving product (from data). 2. Improving loyalty (see point 1) 3. Way more data being generated by their customers per day than their competitors cumulatively. Which they can use to refine products, sell, broaden into other markets, blackmail with etc etc.The data generation is the true driving value of Tesla, making it a tech company.... with some production costs on the side. Especially now that they're largely out of the woods of selling cars at a loss and the barrier to entry their head start in data collection has given them.
This is the main reason I‚Äôm not a Tesla investor. There HAS to be a massive amount of regulation surrounding self driving cars in the future. Any time you add regulation, you slow down progress. It might not matter at the end of the day Tesla is 5 years ahead in self driving tech.
We still down on Tesla or what
Right? Meanwhile Tesla is sitting at over 380.
Bulls must be pissed. Tesla could‚Äôve been $1,250-1350 by now if Elon didn‚Äôt tweet yesterday
In the days following them grabbing headlines about a Tesla purchase they launch a completely unrelated marketing blitz about their Tesla availability? Doesn‚Äôt take an insider to see the obvious friend.
Hyundai owns Boston Dynamics, arguably the most advanced commercial robot company in the world.Tesla has a dancer in a robot suit, but please tell me how they‚Äôre more advanced.
Ford alone has an R&ampD budget 5X that of Tesla‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶So you‚Äôll get a Tesla in 20 years‚Ä¶?
The thing is tech is valued so high because it scales easily. If more people use Facebook they get a few more servers and BOOM they‚Äôre good to go. If more people want any Tesla product there‚Äôs a manufacturing line that needs to be made or built up. That takes a lot of time and money.
Tesla is not at their production possibility frontier. But don't be fooled: Teslas are elastic goods. They don't have significant pricing power, and they'll hit their marginal customer soon.
idk man. there‚Äôs a lot more tech in tesla than in wework
60 isn't a conservative PE ratio, that's what you price something you expect to have explosive short term growth. a mature 0 growth company has a PE ratio of 10, at 60 you are assuming tesla will sell 30m cars at the same profit in the immediate future - that is half of global car sales.
Looks like it‚Äôs meme week ahead. Tesla gains are fueling this.
This is the real logic. Stocks are essentially like art. They are worth whatever someone is willing to pay for them. Tesla has grabbed the attention and the imagination of millions, and rightfully so. The company, and the work they do is very exciting and a promising venture for our species.
Not the answer you're looking for, so apologies i advance, but i dont indulge in "should's" especially not something like this. the market forces are too dynamic and too volatile to really make guesses at market cap, nor is it particularly useful at this juncture.What i will say, is that the first quarter of public availability already looks great. The company currently had ~10k pre orders as of Feb, with $1k minimum deposits, so there is healthy interest, enough to at least get the production cycle started. Their timing is pretty good, as at grid scale, and individually, the world is rapidly shifting toward renewables.Here is [Motor Trend's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQXuaWWriDM) of their flagship R1T truck. Unfortunately neither it, nor Teslas Cybertruck are "work trucks", as neither features a full 8' bed, but, its clear that EV's are going to redefine the status quo of every market segment. The fresh perspective of new organizations like Rivian, offer huge opportunities to rethink how we move around the planet.The company has recruited a lot of talent from Tesla over the past couple years, their product looks like they crossed their T's and dotted their i's, and people are ready for an EV that doesnt feel like an Apple Store inside. I think this IPO is very well positioned.
Of course, but at these valuations that's already priced in.If Google was priced like Tesla it would be at $10T
This is why if Tesla did a 1:10 split people would buy it back up to $1000.It's like an infinite money glitch for Tesla.
tesla is more profitable than any of these other car companies NOW with 30%+ automotive margins and they are the only ones that can actually mass produce these things and will be making more of them than anyone else for a while until china catches up by the end of the decade, you people comparing to companies like ford that are struggling to survive with negative operating margins and 100bil+ in debt while tesla grew theirs from 9% to 14.5% in a single year with now basically all bad debt cleared , how many more years will it take until one of you here learns to read a financial report or realizes that ICE vehicle sales wont be around in a decade not just because theyre polluting but because they cant be competitive in price to EVs especially teslas.
Yeah, Tesla who's profit is \~80% from car sales isn't a car company.  Every car company use tech in one way or another, doesn't mean they are tech company.
I get roasted everytime I say this BUT, when SpaceX does something, it does appear that there is a positive influence on Tesla. Tesla also takes technology developed for SpaceX and incorporates it in the automotive technology from time to time.
If I had a million dollars to short it like that other guy did short term I would. Long term, people are obsessed with tesla like a cult and it‚Äôs gonna go up forever until imo it flames out spectacularly when Elon Musk gets fired because they finally find his dungeon full of dead hookers half fused with robots
Its all about return on invested capital (ROIC) once you understand that, you become perma bull on TSLA.Right now tsla's ROIC is around 25% wich is more than  double of traditional automakers. With new factories coming online with new technologies (single casting and 4680 battery with structural battery pack) that roic will go up to around 40%, in 5-10 yearsThat means TSLA has a return on investment in the range of tech companies like apple. BUT the adressable market by TSLA is 10 time larger than the  smart phone market.And that is only the car business.That is why tesla will be bigger than apple by a wide margin.
It's simple really, Tesla is a cult that also sells EVs.I haven't heard a single coherent thesis justifying tsla share price that isn't on some level reliant on the technoking's loyal following.Don't mistake me for a üåàüêª. I like money way too much to bet against a fanatical hoard with shared delusions.
Fair enough, everyone knows that tech companies can scale up at very low cost.However, the recent run-up in value was based upon an order of physical *cars* not a software or battery licensing deal. This suggests that the whole ‚Äúnot a car company‚Äù argument is not the primary driver of the stock price. Rampant speculation (via call options) is.I am a huge believer in Tesla and EV. My next vehicle will be a Tesla (unless it‚Äôs a Rivian). It‚Äôs possible to root for Tesla, and still think that their valuation is excessive.Any possible good news for Tesla is fully priced in for at least 5 years. It‚Äôs physically impossible for them to sell enough cars, batteries and software to justify their current valuation before then.Yes, I know Amazon was even more overvalued and quickly grew into their lofty share price and beyond, but the cost of adding servers is nothing compared to the cost of building cars.
The fact that it is in indices should suggest otherwise...anyone buying SPY or QQQ is now buying tesla. that definitely props up the price to some extent. and its not like its a small %. its at close to 4% of QQQ and SPY I believe. that is top 10 and it was only recently even added at all. the fact that it was added as a top 10 holding shows how confident the market seems to view it.
Just woke up. How did my Tesla and chegg weekly calls do? I‚Äôm thinking up biggly. Already pre-ordered my Cyber Truck
Amazon have shown an eagerness to dump things that arent profitable. Unless Rivian can grab some market share quickly, I wouldn't be surprised to see Amz sell off their shares. I doubt Rivian would have the confidence of investors once that happens. Of course there would be the bag holders hoping to recreate Tesla magic, but not sure there would be much life left unless another auto company buys them out.Rivian has a long way to go and better have a lot of luck or skilled management/engineers to compete with established companies. Making 1 vehicle that Amz buys isn't really confidence inspiring for the longevity of the company imo.
Let's say Tesla sells 5m cars in **2025** at ASP 45.000 with a 30% profit margin &amp using a 'conservative' 60 PE ratio this comes out to a valuation of $4000 (without Energy &amp other business lines). Discount 15% per year and the **fair value of Tesla now is $2100**. If you believe Tesla can achieve these numbers (number of cars, ASP, profit margin), you should not be surprised at the current price of Tesla.Btw:Walmart profit last quarter: $4.3b  Toyota profit last quarter: $7.8b  Tesla profit last quarter: $1.6b  Tesla will catch up soon with the others and is growing much faster so logically it is valued higher.
Means break even is something like $820. I don't think Tesla army will let it go below $1000 at this point. But you might be right. May be it will be profitable at some point.
I'm just gonna replace it with a second Tesla and skip all that. It's a 2010. Driving it into the ground first.
‚ÄúTesla is not just a car company,‚Äù and yet the stock only goes up on positive CAR sale news.  Why?
Considering we're at the beginning of the renewable revolution, i suspect RIVN will like TSLA, see stock prices similarly disconnected from P/E. Rivian's product is well packaged, likely providing a better fit and finish than Tesla, which has the most desired cars on the planet. If Rivian can fulfill its order sheet and scale itself with demand, this IPO may be the cheapest price this stock ever sees.
Tesla shares will be the new world currency after the Dollar implodes
The logical solution is to short Tesla.For this reason, I will be purchasing $10000 calls
Tesla isn‚Äôt worth 1.5T
So you're arguing that a share of Tesla is basically an NFT (limited edition 1/1,000,000,000).And you're not wrong, because the valuation of Tesla is totally irrational relative to the potential future value of cash flows that can be generated by the company, so it's basically just speculation that you are buying something scarce that someone else will pay more for (greater fool theory as referenced elsewhere in this thread).
&gt Why is your sister's underwear selling for $150 on the internet?This is such a stupid comparison.You can't wear Tesla on your head.
OP buys $250k of Tesla...And the whole subreddit asks "What is the $1.27 fee"...What a special breed of dumb in this sub
As overvalued as it is now, it will blow up to the roof even more when the transition towards EV and renewable energy is more apparent. Nobody knows how well Tesla will do. People just know that it's well positioned for the future and that's enough for 1.2T cap I guess.
Tesla is growing 50% year over yearFind me another large cap that can do thatIt will be a 5 trillion dollar company by 2025
Market is hungry for EVs and all people who missed Tesla train would want to jump on Rivian but all said I agree with you it's overpriced at this level and they still need to go through production hell aka Elon and nooen knows how this will turn out... still they have amazon backing so unlikely to go bust so very hard to tell
I'm bullish on Tesla but the valuation is silly. Here's the thing nobody want to talk about. 1. If we taper then stocks will recoil and these values in tech will collapse at least for a few months. 2. If we don't taper and we just keep going, then we get no reset. No reset means hyper inflation. Hyper inflation means bigger collapse later.This is not a fud post. This is reality. I have no idea when we will reset, but something eventually has to give.
Tesla 1250+ tomm
No body tell him that Tesla printed gaap net income of $1.6 billion last quarter, up 5x y-o-y. He still thinks TSLA doesn‚Äôt make a GAAP net profit. Lulz.
A $60 billion valuation is just bonkers for Rivian.Tesla was trading at only a $40 to $50 billion valuation in the first half of 2019 all while delivering several hundred thousand vehicles a year. Rivian by comparison is reportedly producing just 1 vehicle a day at the moment, and is almost certainly at least a few years away from producing several hundred thousand in a year.
lol and it showed the guy driving around in circles in parking lots and doing repetitive stop/starts to wear down the battery.lol and Tesla had it all covered.
Tesla should end barely green just to fuck with bears üêª Totally unbiased here!!üëÄ holds 330 shares‚Ä¶.  üëÄ
Ouch boy, I posted yesterday about an infinite money glitch if Tesla touts the same deal with Avis. Bought $5k in calls as a joke and I'm sitting here now up for the entire year, no more problems in sight. Just gonna chill and enjoy my once in a life time winnings
If every dick, Jane, and Larry want to buy Tesla‚Ä¶.well‚Ä¶it will keep doing this. 99% of people you meet don‚Äôt know or care what market cap is so yeah, this doesn‚Äôt need to make sense
Tesla coin
&gt Tesla is an American automaker and energy storage company based in Palo Alto, California. The company specializes in electric cars, Lithium-ion battery energy storage and solar panel manufacturing
Tesla? Hmm, never heard of it but I‚Äôll check it out
I went YOLO on Tesla puts last fall and it turned into my biggest win ever. I realize those weren't shorts but similar idea.
Tesla could have 100% of the entire car industry on earth and it wouldn't justify their current valuation. 30% of the planet's car industry plus 100% of all energy storage and battery markets wouldn't justify their current valuation, either, and that's even being generous and assuming the energy storage industry grows something like 400% in ten years.
That is rich. Musk complaining about over valued rivals. Its official Tesla is a Boomer stock......
With how shitty people treat rental cars, and the current immaturity of Tesla‚Äôs repair process + a global parts shortage‚Ä¶ how well would this end for Hertz? There‚Äôs Fords sitting in repair shops for 3+ months now because the one part they need is on national back-order. Before COVID wasn‚Äôt there already a 3+ month lead if your Tesla needed a part?
Correct there is. My model 3 drops around 25% range below 32F. The guy claimed to be stranded and lied about charging the car and its state of charge when it got towed. Tesla came back and showed a map of where he went and state of charge at beginning and end lol
One of these days tesla will collapse... it will likely be a week after this man goes bankrupt lmao
Yeah...maybe dont start with TESLA....but go with some smaller shit to figure it all out, then as TSLA settles down and moves into a range, sell calls against it.&amp#x200BJust remember...if they do get assigned, you will get capital gains on a 250k gain.  So thats about 45k in taxes by my count.
Tesla is picking up momentum again to the upside
This hurts so much because I owned 178 shares that same year. The NYT article of winter range loss scared me and I sold for a measly 35% gain at $39/share in March 2012...Turns out the "journalist" lied about everything including needing to get the car towed while Tesla tracked everything remotely
If Tesla V-shapes, I‚Äôll name my first born Elon.
I think it's more a sign that Tesla is reaching another step in maturity where companies like Hertz and potentially others want to work with Tesla in the future. It's a confidence thing it doesn't matter to the people who are already confident Tesla can sell every vehicle and grow quickly in the foreseeable future
Bet Tesla will announce a stock split
Word on the street is CEO of AVIS ordered his grand daughter a Tesla.Therefore: $CAR to the moon.
Who bought Tesla calls at the top? Call volume was huge yesterday so I know some of you retards did
Somebody get the defibrillator for TESLA this is bullshit elon you owe me some money Pig
Hi WallStreetBets. I‚Äôm new to investing and bought a Tesla call out of recommendation of some of your users. I was just wondering what why the value of my call is -60%. Is there something I can do about this? Thanks.
Seems equivalent of his ‚ÄúTesla stock price is too high imo‚Äù tweet
Fuck that ! Tesla $1200+ end of the week suck my cock üò§
Elon could go to jail for securities fraud and the tesla bubble still wouldn't pop.
Who ever bought my Tesla 11/5 1375 calls for 600 this mourning, get fucked
Tesla people:Yesterday: I would literally serve up my asshole for Elon‚Äôs pleasure.Today: why do they let Elon have social media.
I'm bag holding Tesla calls that were up 150% yesterday üê∑ü§°
What's next? Tesla would accept Shiba Inu as payment?
I think what people were speculating on is the following scenario: \- Hertz gets 100k rental Teslas\- it is now easier for more people to get test drives/experience with Tesla vehicles which could push more to make the purchase decision\- this impacts price elasticity of demand which gives Tesla the option to push prices/margins even higher
TSLA predictions:Upvote if Tesla closes over $1180Downvote if Tesla closes below $1180
I come from the future. Dune 2 isn‚Äôt a big hit because Jason Mamoa isn‚Äôt in it. Squid game 2 is interesting. Tesla still has more demand than supply, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the 2024 presidential election.
Tesla has never been rational
I think we need to start a thread counting all the millionaires Tesla created.
Down 35% on Tesla calls I bought on the top and dips. Fuk. Gotta hold now to 0 I guess.
Sure, which again doesn't change anything, Tesla just keeps selling every car they make regardless.
No clue why any of it matters. Tesla is production constrained so the deal didn't mean much to start. They're paying the same price as everyone else so why would a contract matter? ü§∑
Someone better tell Hertz, they are advertising on their website free Tesla network charging from Nov 1st 2021 till Jan 31st 2022.
It's gonna be fucking hilarious when Tesla is the catalyst for the next market crash.SPY and QQQ are fucking balls deep on tsla and will get absolutely rekt if Tesla crashes.This is going be the stupidest fucking market crash of all time. A crash caused because braindead retail investors bubbled a stock because they liked that their CEO shitposts on Twitter.
 Avis announcing it also has fake car orders with Tesla that are not in an agreed contract.
Elon's tanked the stock a half dozen times already. The trick with Tesla is to wait for Elon to say something then buy after.
You asked the wrong sub. They hate car debt here.Here's the thing: you're going to be making 80-100k/year and you say the prospect of a car upgrade excites you. That excitement has value.Look at your expenses. Understand what you'd be giving up for that monthly payment. Is it still the most important item that you're willing to spend the money on? Are you still hitting your long term savings and retirement goals? If so, I say go for it. That's why you work hard, it's what money is for. Can't take it with you.I was in a similar position a few years ago, contemplating a Tesla. I couldn't quite afford it without impacting monthly savings.. but my last car was done and I couldn't stomach paying for a different car that I didn't want. So, I took on additional responsibilities at work and asked for a raise. I never do that. I ended up getting a raise equal to double that monthly car payment. If it weren't for the excitement of the new car, I'd have stayed static where I was. Many of us are motivated by different things in life. Don't lose sight of what makes you get up in the morning, and don't feel guilty treating yourself. Just be responsible about it.
Tesla has long broken all the fundamentals that it's no longer generic stock. It's beyond meme stock.
Watching Tesla is terrifying - our market is officially broken
So obviously Tesla is going green today based off this strength lmao
All this means is that if Hertz is going to buy what they announced they were, they'll have to buy them like the rest of us do. Tesla was gonna sell all of their production anyway. Even if Hertz only buys 50k cars vs 100k, that's still a huge opportunity to get more butts in seats, which will turn into future purchases. If the market wants to sell the news here, by all means go ahead. I'd gladly take a bit of a cool down period here. I love seeing my position grow like it has this month, but admittedly it's scary af. I'll take a boring 3 months.
From Bloomberg‚Äôs John Authers e-mail today :-A year ago, Berkshire was the larger company. In the 12 months since then, the increase in Tesla‚Äôs market cap has been equivalent to more than the entire market cap of Berkshire Hathaway. What it took Buffett an entire career to create, the market has bestowed on Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla in just 12 months.Buffett has turned 90, and Berkshire‚Äôs valuation is suffering. Berkshire Hathaway currently trades at 1.4 times book value, having reached 1.6 times four years ago ‚Äî but that‚Äôs still roughly in the middle of its range since the global financial crisis. Tesla currently trades at 45 times book value.
Tesla 1500 EOW or I sell everything and join the sardaukar
Ford sells 3 million cars a year. Market cap 71 billion.Tesla sells 220k cars a year. Market cap 1.2 trillion.I don't know whether to short Tesla, long Ford, or both.
Bulls make money, bears make money, people that didn't sell their Tesla calls yesterday get slaughtered
If TSLA goes over amazons market cap i will tattoo a tesla logo on my forehead
If Tesla suddenly went bankrupt that would push the price up to 2k instantly
Haha, I love how people circle jerked to the idea of a recently  bankrupt company just mentioning that they gonna buy 100k teslas by end of 2022. Even if you can get through that lunacy, you gotta get through the fact that tesla is having a production problem that would likely make that goal remote anyway. This world is getting crazier by the week.
"The tesla stock is too high"   \-Elon Musk, May 2020
So is it insider trading if a ceo has a potential huge sale(like the hertz and tesla deal), releases info publicly, at the second buys calls, and then who cares if the deal actually goes through because you just made a shit ton on basically insider trading?
Tesla is literally sitting where it was at lunch time yesterday and some people act like it‚Äôs imploding lol
Tesla green by open gtfo
Tesla will be big green today. We're all forgetting it's price is based on feelings, not fundamentals
&gt Tesla has a deal with Hertz to rent out their cars for $8/hour. This is not bullish.
Tesla options @ open again![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)?, don't mind if i do.
Tesla future red can only mean big geeeen dildo at open
Tesla: *files for bankruptcy*WSB: It‚Äôll be +5% at open!
$4BN dollar ‚Äúdeal‚Äù added $200BN to market cap and now Elon is saying that not only is there no deal but that even if there was it wouldn‚Äôt add any positives to Tesla economics. Yikes.
Lol there are so many scared bulls in Tesla right now trying to reassure themselves ü§£
Yeah, I would sell at open. I wonder what the guy with a million dollars or so in shorting Tesla is going to do
Tesla too high imo
Lmao you fuckin bears really doubt retard Tesla bull strength     You‚Äôre fucked
Tesla the absolute mad lad might actually retard power through this gay bear shit. Already up $48 from premarket low of $1120
Tesla down $60 to a price not seen since 1pm yesterdayAfter being up *checks 1 month chart* more than 40%
So Tesla at $2k by December? Got it.
Really hoping my Tesla calls aren‚Äôt fucked now
Where is that fucking legend that doubled down on puts on Tesla? That retard is getting paid fat stacks today.
50k here idun give fuk. I knw tesla gaps up higher
Sooo. We waiting for the tesla sell-off and then buying the dip??
Who cares, Tesla only goes up
Tesla bear cucks really pulling out all the stops right now. Fuck it. GREEN EOD BULLS WE RIDE OR DIE. FAITH
The Tesla bears in the media are trying so hard
Damn Tesla hasn‚Äôt been at this level since lunchtime yesterday
Lol, not holding tesla at the moment so am unaffected, but jeez they love to pile on the fud at the most opportune moments don‚Äôt they ?

Lmao Cramer recommends Tesla as a momentum play and the stock drops like a rock
The hertz deal was always a scam. Hertz can't afford one tesla.
Anyone else going all in on Tesla calls at open?
What if spy and tesla meet at 500 to kiss?

Tesla down 3%, i think I can finally afford to eat double ramen
Lmaaao the same shit I said last week after the Tesla and hertz news. If Teslas bottleneck is producing enough cars to meet demand why should the deal even meter when they can‚Äôt produce any more. The cars being sold to hertz will be coming from consumers inventory ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

i wanna buy puts on tesla soon but i‚Äôm worried
I can totally envision Tesla opening up at 4%+ in 15 min.
Tesla green by open or I‚Äôm Perma banned
People seem to have misunderstood what I meant. This is not some random ‚ÄúTesla good or Tesla bad?‚Äù question. This is a discussion, I wanna see if you have numbers to back up your price targets in 5-10 years.I‚Äôm a long term Tesla holder and I‚Äôve been holding it for almost 3 years. It is at least worth addressing if Tesla is worth its current price or not. To me, Tesla is still at its infant stage (or better, childhood stage) but the market has already cashed in its growth by too much. It all happens too quickly, and as a long term investor, I hate it.There is no doubt on earth that I still love Tesla and Tesla still has a big future ahead. But it‚Äôs not like the stonk only goes up. This price surge we see is CLEARLY driven by big money‚Äôs on the Wall Street and we the retailers can only watch it happen. It is an invitation from some big money to other big moneys for a risky game play. There will be winners and there will be losers, but at the end of the day, the play will come to an end. Maybe 3 months, maybe 6, but not forever. And at that time we will see another big crash on Tesla, just the same as before. Or there will be a prolonged period of time where Tesla just stayed there doing nothing or even decreases it market cap. So if you just fomo‚Äôed into this madness, all I gotta say is good luck to you.I hate when the company I loved got played so hard and maybe that‚Äôs why I even bothered to write this post. Remember, short term plays are always for the Wall Street. We the retailers can only make reasonable analysis and set our long term price targets. To me, all these surges have played out so fast and my price targets have only got surpassed again and again, and waaaaay ahead of schedule, but I‚Äôve yet to see a single post discussing this problem. Well, if you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs at least worth addressing (after a 20x year), I have no words to you.Lemme ask y‚Äôall again. What exactly is your price target for Tesla by 2025? Because of what reasons? And do you have numbers to back up your claim?
#This post tells me to buy Tesla puts tomorrow. This could be the top
(Realtor here). The car you drive has sooooo much to do with how people perceive you in this business. With any forward facing sales job, image and confidence are the two major keys to converting clients and building rapport. I drove an Accord for about a year, a VW Passat, and then now I have a Tesla. It‚Äôs very obvious now that clients take me more serious just at the first impression of showing up in my car to showings. Haven‚Äôt even met them yet and they are already trusting me. Plus, you‚Äôre going to learn a shit ton soon about write offs and in Real Estate, your vehicle is a huge tax savings since you use it for business so why not spend a little more for something you‚Äôre going to be in all damn day to save a little money on taxes.
&gt I would argue Tesla is years behind in being able to make autos at the scale the rest of the industry can.Ford has the battery production capacity to make 50k Mach-E per year right now.  That's it. Tesla is well on their way past 1m units.Ford has started a 5 year project of building one (!) battery factory (yay) that will get them to 700k cars per year around the 2027-2028 model year (sad panda face).Ford would need 15 (!) of these factories to fully electrify.  Look at Ford's balance sheet.  Look at their bond ratings.  Look at all the gas car infrastructure they need to write down.  They don't have the money.  Ford won't be owning the EV market, Ford will be very lucky to still be a company in 2030.**Tesla has factory build plans (with factories going up as we speak) to produce 20m units per year by 2030.**Tesla is planning to eat everyone else's lunch, and they have a 10 year headstart to the cafeteria.
Elon said Hertz deal not signed yet and Tesla will not prioritize Hertz deal so it will take forever for them to deliver 100K cars
Remember when Amazon only sold books?  In 2030 we will be saying Remember when Tesla only sold cars?
20M cars sold = 8T market cap? I didn't realize Tesla was making 400k from each car sold...
Stay tuned for tomorrow's episode of "How much money will Tesla calls make today?"
3x faster vs. 10x the scale (I‚Äôm guessing at these numbers) is still losing on pure numbers though and efficiency is gained quickly in this space. I‚Äôm speaking as someone who spent the first half of his career as a project manager for an automotive manufacturer.I‚Äôm not doubting Tesla as a company I‚Äôm doubting the valuation, especially when compared to their competition who has infrastructure that dwarfs Tesla‚Äôs. That infrastructure doesn‚Äôt even have to be part of their company: the supply base for auto OEMs is huge and the big ones have expertly built relationships in that space to limit their liability while gaining a good amount of value out of these 2nd and 3rd tier manufacturers. This stuff doesn‚Äôt show on the balance sheet directly.
Very nicely done. You will continue to be well rewarded as Tesla becomes the most valuable company in the history of the world
you typed all this bullshit when you could have just said "if u short tesla u'll git ur pee pee stomped"
What is love, Tesla don't Hertz me, don't Hertz me, no more
What if Elon were to get hit by a bus tomorrow? Imagine what it'd do to the stock, it's crazy. Now imagine if Elon died while using Tesla full self driving, oh dear.
If it‚Äôs good enough to post a screen shot it‚Äôs good enough to take profits.  It‚Äôs not like Papa Elon had a history of [posting Tweets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/elon-musk-says-tesla-has-not-signed-contract-with-hertz-yet.html) that cause markets to fluctuate wildly, right?
Can you back up that other automakers are years behind? I would argue Tesla is years behind in being able to make autos at the scale the rest of the industry can. The battery portion is a widget for the major auto makers, and the tech is a luxury that is nice, but not all that important to the majority of consumers
I need Elon to tweet ‚Äútesla stock price is too high‚Äù again so I can buy that mf dip üò§üò§üò§
Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been sitting on thousands in cash too buy a home when u could have been yoloing it all in Tesla calls

Will Tesla be green tomorrow? place your votes!https://strawpoll.com/xsogr2k4z
no i dont even know what a ticker is but i heard tesla only goes up
I mean I've read articles talking about how tesla's value is not even close to what the stock market says, basically tesla is a m√™me stock
&gt The Wu-Tang Clan is not a group of investors. The members are rappers and they have nothing to do with Tesla or its stock price.
I will never buy a Tesla solely because of Elon. And if you're reading this, I'm not sorry.
Tesla has more demand than productionIf you are smart enough, elon says hertz is just micropenis sized order
For anyone without a Twitter wondering what Elon tweeted out.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome!If any of this is based on Hertz, I‚Äôd like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers.Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics.‚Äù
if u actually read the tesla tweet, its very bullish.
Tesla apes r nuts.. they buy every dip
Shorting Tesla means you want world hunger to continue.  How selfish can you be?  Buying Tesla shares is now a humanitarian act
Tesla bulls so scared of market open they're downvoting everything lol
The main takeaway from Musks tweet. Tesla cannot produce enough cars. $2000
Tesla to 1500 EOW
Every time someone says Tesla is overvalued, it goes up more out of spite
25k in Tesla calls*Chuckles, I'm in danger!*
yeah, all potentially good points. The big thing folks don‚Äôt factor in (and it‚Äôs incredibly difficult) is that Tesla is the _main_ driver (pun intended) of transforming an entire industry to electrify. Those still trying to value it with similar staid analysis of units sold just don‚Äôt get it. They are a tech company: it‚Äôs the software and batteries. They‚Äôve overcome being laughed at for nearly a decade and now _every_ auto maker is playing catch-up and most are years behind. There are cult members but there are also die hard believers and buyers of their product. It‚Äôs gonna be super fun watching OP!
Long story short Tesla is free money till it‚Äôs not
Watch Tesla trade flat tomorrow just to fuck everyone
&gt The most reasonable Tesla call is to buy a Model S. It's the best car in its price range and it has an excellent resale value.
Did the same thing with Tesla calls. You are welcome, apes
TSLA bears are you really this dumb? No contract signed locking in pricing. In other words, when TSLA goes to fulfil the Hertz order, they will be sold at future market price - not locked in at today‚Äôs price. Pricing on Tesla‚Äôs will likely increase this coming year. This is bullish for TSLA. Elon isn‚Äôt cutting them a break on the unit cost because Tesla doesn‚Äôt have a demand problem.
Except nobody in developed nations really cares enough to prevent 1.5C temp increases. It's all talk and no profits for tesla.
Elon full tweet (in response to somebody thanking him for high stock price)You‚Äôre welcome!If any of this is based on Hertz, I‚Äôd like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers.Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics.
Invest in VTI or VOO rather than Tesla.

Probably will sell my Tesla calls at open for 50% gain and then watch it climb all day so I see what I left on the table by being all rational and non üê∑
I‚Äôve invested in them for a while now and I‚Äôve been hearing the same arguments consistently since 2017.We will seeeee. But so far the bulls have been right on Tesla
PSA: if you are in Tesla and didn't sell today, you're the pig part of that "Pigs get slaughtered" phrase
&gtThe AI is so bad that Tesla fatal accidents felt like they were happening every week this year lol.FYI, there's been ***zero*** crashes with FSD Beta over the past 12 months, with 2,000 drivers - let alone "fatalities".For reference: 2,000 average US drivers driving average non-Tesla cars have ~50 police-reported crashes over 12 months, according to NHTSA data.Tesla's AI ***is*** genuinely good.Friends don't let friends get TSLA DD from TeslaCharts, Mark Spiegel, Michael Burry or Jim Chanos... ü§¶
Why risk bad press when there's over 200,000 applicants but only 10,000 testers needed? ü§îThink of this as Tesla hiring competent safety drivers, and there's an admission test to find the best ones.
Developed nations have under a decade to half emissions to avoid 1.5C temperature rises.Tesla make batteries, they do solar, they‚Äôre developing smart grids and a sustainably powered driverless car network.Since nobody else can mass produce quality, cheap electric cars at anywhere near the scale Tesla can, they have no serious competitors. The forces of necessity are going to drive capital into every space Tesla operates in. And this is without getting into the impact of their AI and how disruptive autonomous vehicles will be to so many industries.If a ‚Äúphone company‚Äù like Apple can be worth 2 trillion, why is it so nuts to think that‚Äôs out of reach to a company with the goal of transitioning to a sustainable future, while the planet burns around us?
Watching the big short. See you at 950 tesla
They're a car company ... how can a car company be worth several trillion $ ... they sell cars ... how many people do you know ow who own a tesla? How many people do you know who own a Ford?Why is tesla worth 17x Ford?I'd short this shit but I know the market will roll over me with pure unadulterated retardation.
No shit.  He is running a 3X leveraged Tesla ETF.  Wait a minute!  Sugar Mama Kathie?  Is that you?
Bro can you chill with Tesla? We get u don‚Äôt understand
I‚Äôll keep buying Tesla calls until it blows up in my face
Tesla makes me question reality. It's fucking creepy.
tesla millionaires flexing dicks all over the place.....
It just wanted to make the Tesla logo.
I disagree, I believe Tesla is a lot like apple. They may be worse than other brands but their logo and name is more than enough to keep their role at the top.
He‚Äôs selling shares he doesn‚Äôt own at market value, right now. So far he has collected $400,000 in cash for selling Tesla shares that he never owned, but he owes his counterparty the stock at some point. He pays interest on this the entire time, too, to his broker. This is called shorting the stock. You need to buy back the shares later (zeroing out the negative equity in your account account). The idea is that you plan on a downturn, so you can buy them back at a cheaper price. The spread is what you actually net.Imagine if I sold you a giant metal drum filled with oil for $200. Then we lit the oil on fire and watched it burn down. Then I bought back just the empty metal drum for $20. I just made $180 shorting the drum barrel.
The bubble is in Tesla, no Chinese EVs
I've sorted Tesla on several run ups. And got thoroughly burned everytime.Even odds Tesla goes to 200,000 before it hits 500 again.And I hold $7k in puts!
Don't worry boys... I have been watching since 2019 and about to finally FOMO into Tesla and tank it.
Can someone please give me confirmation bias that my Tesla $970 CC will expire worthless this Friday?
People don't get why Tesla is going up because they have no idea how the market works or what to look at.$TSLA is up due to retailer mass consolidation. Ten(well now 9) stocks are basically pushing the three major indexes as people spend the last two years tired of figuring out charts, being burned by earnings and memes, and the recent higher prices for goods which give them less to spend.Tesla is one of those 9 stocks. That's it.In fact at this point 60% of retail are in these 9 stocks. All it takes is to manipulate one of them by a decent amount and the whole thing crumbles.People are stubborn and make themselves believe they are causing the upward trends in the etfs or Tesla when they aren't. Tesla can drop to $400 in a couple days if institutions wanted it to. Many are already diversifying outside the most popular stocks the last two years (with some exceptions like MSFT).Keep an eye on institutions during the FED meeting the next two days, you are going to see gradual movements to make it not seem obvious that they are preparing to take advantage of the dive.If you are in Tesla now and over $100k+ in profits then take it out. Don't hold at this point. There isn't time to correct after the FED meeting as you will likely be priced out. Puts will be much more expensive in the next couple weeks for high value stocks.
Eh I own 2 teslas and have fsd. It's cool but I'd never trust fsd fully. Its nowhere near ready as Tesla likes you to believe. Still great cars tho.
/s?Don‚Äôt call me a bear, but if you think Tesla will be worth $30T vs the ENTIRE rest of the equity market at $69T, you really are retarded.
BREAKING NEWS: Tesla stock rise sharply on optimism of Tesla stock rising sharply!
Firmly believing a sharp dip in teslaYes, this has ended well for the other billions in dollars lostBig daddy musk only moons baby
I‚Äôm actually with you, I‚Äôm a huge Tesla bull and truly believe they‚Äôll be worth $3-4tn within the next 4 years.I sold 75% of my holding at $1100 though and for the first time in about 3 years I‚Äôm hoping Tesla‚Äôs share price corrects so I can buy back in..This feels alien to me. Good luck!
The Daily chart RSI on Tesla is 94!!! Weighted Moving Average is 160$ lower than it's current price. Not saying it won't keep ripping into Valhalla, but there's going to be a rugpull at the top, and it's going to be violent. Still, this is amazing gain porn.
How is Burry's doing? I wonder if he is still shorting Tesla
I believe my odds are substantially higher than the outcome of roulette. My strategy is simple, I strongly believe Tesla will have a sharp dip/drop. I don't know when, but it will. My odds of it happening increase on every pump giving the fact the next stock Tesla would overcome is actually Amazon, then Google. This is not a small market cap stock with unlimited upside, it's running out of room in my opinion. Although it is possible for Tesla to temporarily surpass these companies because of how irrational the market is. (True valuation clearly doesn't matter here) the point here is, its current price may be fair for Tesla but in the future. Not now, the bulls got too greedy too soon.  The argument that Tesla is should not be worth more than companies like Amazon and Google is strong, of course, those companies will grow in value as well where things fall back into a reasonable line.  But, it goes back to square one, too high, too fast, too soon. None of the bull's arguments defend Tesla during a harsh red week or month in the market, worse a crash. We all know based on history Tesla would be the first to go.   Don't get me wrong. I strongly believe Tesla deserves a high valuation. I am all for a $1 Trillion even upwards of a $3 trillion market cap, but all with given time. Too fast, too high, too soon. The cult-like following on Tesla is built of money craving impatient newbs, which a good amount of run away at first sight of a change or new hype. Panic, profit takers. During that time, when it comes, id like to have my turn in making a profit. I rather bet on a dip with such high numbers than bet on an even further run. Then again, even if it goes up we go back to square one, I increase my odds averaging up.  This is a shorter-term strategy, not a Perma bear case.
Visual Mod is picking up the stock split Tesla is announcing tomorrow üß†üß†üß†
Every upvote is how many %points Tesla will go up tomorrow
The sequel to the movie The Big Short will be about whoever eventually guesses right on the timing of Tesla's downfall - instant billionaire, if it ever happens. At this rate though I think Tesla is more than just a car company and becoming _"too big to fail"_. I'm just waiting for them to start providing Tesla Bank accounts or Brokerage accounts
Planning on buying Tesla tomorrow, I got a real bad track record of buying the top. So Tesla has to tank. It‚Äôs only logic and rightful for the universe to continue to fuk me.
buy Tesla calls guys, if you keep on buying it keeps on gamma squeezing
I read ‚ÄúTesla Autism Factory‚Äù‚Ä¶ got excited for a moment
Never thought we‚Äôd come to the day where people would Martingale bet Tesla to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars and post results to Reddit.
Made $1,000 today on Tesla. Let's make another $1,000 tommorow. Swinging my gains of course for Papa Musk's share price.
Ahh yes, Tesla will be worth 3 trillion.
I'm holding these 200 tesla shares for at least another 5 years and going to keep averaging up
Berlin and Texas. Charging infrastructure being opened up for other oems.new rebates in infrastructure bill.back log of months.All good news for tesla and tsla
Never short Tesla
Wen Tesla crash?
Because Tesla is insanely overvalued and while SPY also is, it's not as bad.
Never sell Tesla.
Oh no Cramer is a Tesla bull
I wanna jump into Tesla but I know it‚Äôll drop as soon as I do. 90% of my decisions don‚Äôt go that way but I know if I go into TSLA It would fuck it up for everyone. You‚Äôre welcome in advance.
No one cares about valuation anymore. Retards who buy Tesla calls at daily RSI=92 make more money than the smart dudes.
Imma buy Tesla puts tmmr.Sike, you think I must be retarded. Never bet against Papa Elon‚Äôs üñï üåàüêªs
Tesla market cap :   2019 : $75B  2020 : $669B  2021 : $1.2TNot betting against tesla but the valuation is crazy
So Tesla to 1500 eow
I filled my basket with Tesla shares and shoved the eggs up my ass
So Elon cashed out $2.6bn right now. He should definitely donate that to Avis so they can also buy 100,000 Tesla's and then Tesla will rise another 25%. Literal infinite money glitch
Have 30k worth of Tesla but it‚Äôs in my IRA. I‚Äôm pumped but it feels like it doesn‚Äôt even exist
I think he means Tesla again.
Tesla is the greatest example of bulls paying bulls. Shorts don't even dare to touch the stock anymore and some have even taken their long hedge to the extreme. It's just bulls selling to the next bulls on a never ending cycle. "hey man wanna get richer? Take my shares and hold for a day" rinse and repeat
Now big question What is next Tesla? ü§îü§î
Tesla is officially the all time greatest play
I shorted a call spread 1190/1225 expiring this week and instant regret the way Tesla closed today. Sadness. Tesla may never see a red day ever again.
A friend told me today that $10k invested in a Jan $1600-1700 call option spread a month ago would be worth $400,000 now. It was $.20 a month ago. Right now it is $8.00 I'm talking about the Jan $1,600/$1,700 spread. Right now it would be $8.00 to make $100. So that would be 12x your money if it's $1700 in January. I think Tesla will be over $2,000 by the end of December.Not advice, just what I think. I can't buy calls on my investment platform and I don't really understand them anyway.But a lot of people here do so I think they must be buying TSLA December and January calls.
Holy smokes this guy is really doing it!I don't agree but I kinda though this was a fart in the wind when I read this.Obviously I know this guy has bigger cock and balls than me but wow tesla pumping so hard, my grandma landlord, priest and dog walker all hold calls. To the moon!
Like tesla?
Tesla weekly calls is the way. Finally built up the balls to hold one overnight.
Love r/thetagang.  That‚Äôs where most of my plays areBut I just made almost $50k today from Tesla alone.  What a drug. That would take me months of perfect plays with thetagang
Tesla stock is basically a UBI
In the last 6 trading days Tesla has added roughly 300B market cap to its 900B high (900B to 1.2T).This 300B market cap added in 6 days is more than the entire value of:Toyota (249B)Volkswagen (149B)GM + Ford (80B + 71B)Cisco (236B)Intel (200B)Adobe (almost) (304B)almost 2x AMD (151B x2)
Why Tesla why not spy puts
&gthow can the broker help him. He'd have to buy back the ITM calls at a loss.Yeah, to get out of his options position he will have to buy them back for more than he paid. I think a broker might be able to help with being able to sell some of his Tesla shares to finance closing his positions. Right now his Tesla shares are locked up covering his calls.
I'd be mad at missing out on Tesla, but they saved my account months ago when they had a similar rip up around 700s and gave me a first 10 bagger on only $500 to 5k. It was my last $500 too
Every day I hate myself for not buying Tesla and every day I still resist the temptation to buy it
Sitting here looking like a ü§° I watched tesla go up so much last 2 weeks. Why did I just sit in the bleachers.
My Tesla weekly puts are in danger lmaooooooo I should have sold on that first dip ü§°ü§°ü§°
Wait till you discover Tesla puts
 Welp my Tesla poots r fuk
Chances of Tesla $1245 EOW?Please like for confirmation bias
Tesla 1500 end of tomorrow is not a meme
Alright I‚Äôm finally buying Tesla stock now. Going all in
If Tesla announces a stock split this shit is going to 1500 minimum.
Bought my first share in 2016. But guess what during March of 2020 during Covid crash tesla was equivalent to my average cost. That‚Äôs when I bought most of my position after seeing my gains go to almost negative.
We all know Tesla is going to have a -50% day eventually. This is going to be horrendous but god speed to all those ballsy enough to play and making money.
I sold my Tesla calls for a loss Friday ü§°
Tesla at 900 alright time to sell. Tesla runs to 1000 okay I‚Äôm not buying. Tesla runs to 1100 okay game time. What the fuck lol. Why did I wait.
I‚Äôm a gay ber, but never a short Tesla gay ber
Tesla should just buy all the auto makers. Itd be like 20 percent of the market cap for everything
Tesla is an absolute fucking monster wtf lol
Tesla stock for president
Watch they raise interest rates and Tesla goes to 500 or sum shit
Tesla will only go up
Fucking hell guys I shorted Tesla at 775 like 2 months ago and I‚Äôm still fucking waiting to cover it, I thought last week was painful
Pelosi might be the richest woman on Earth if she holds onto her Tesla leaps lmao
I really can‚Äôt see how there is any other play tomm than Tesla calls.  Yeah this won‚Äôt last forever but it is here now.  Take it.
I‚Äôm fucking broke‚Ä¶ thanks tesla puts
need tesla to stock split so i can go balls deep and then sell calls when it skyrockets again
So what your saying is that my 1475 tesla calls printing by 11/5 lmfaooooooo
I might have to go all in on Tesla tomorrow. It feels like too good of an opportunity.
If you down vote someone just because they mention Tesla in a good way, go fuck your self, bagholding bitch ass bear.
Hahahah Tesla at 1.1trn a safe bet? I hope you are joking lol
Tesla options expire on Friday, I‚Äôm looking forward to OP posting his Friday activity.
Just call your broker. They can get you out of the position if you want. You're not trapped at all. Yes, you'll lose some of the gain due to premium being higher, but, it's better than waiting multiple years. You will get more money closing the position now than you would get if it pulled back. The only way you make more money than you have right now is if tesla stays flat for the few years (in which case you're really only making time-value-of-money options premium which isn't really worth it) or if tesla continues to rocket up (which would push the premium down and make the calls trade closer to intrinsic value). &amp#x200BTBH i'd just get out of the position now.
Tesla just gained P/E of 30 today lmao.
Tesla back where it belongs. #1 stock of all time. GOAT.
$7500 off Tesla today.  Should‚Äôve been $50k but I‚Äôm a pussy.
Tesla is the next Tesla
Well Tesla put was not a good idea. Rip
Watching the Tesla train go. Not on it. I‚Äôm just at the station. Haven‚Äôt even bought any ticket üé´
Aight dude. CC seller here. Definitely not that size of account value. But basically you just need the Capitol to close your position. I'd wait till Tesla settles down and the IV drops back significantly before you do. But basically at max level options trading you can sell your shares and then close your positions with the money from the shares. If you don't have this level of trading/margin available call your broker and they will do this for you. You get the net. Invest 90% in an ETF and never touch it again since you have a gambling addiction. But definitely wait till Tesla settles down. Even if it ramps up another 200 bucks over the month. Wait till it does it's thing where it kinda trades down/sideways for 3 months. The IV drop will probably save you 50-100k when closing that position. And finally, you're not retarded for selling CC. You just have yourself a guaranteed win in exchange for money up front.
you must be stupid to not buy tesla calls daily. I'm fucking stupid.
i mean literally tesla is like you don‚Äôt wanna get in because it‚Äôs been running so fucking much, then you finally say fuck it and get in and your options immediately tank 70% and you say never again, only to repeat e process 4 months later
Tesla doing what the apes wish their stock would do üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Tesla is coming for Google lmao
What a fucking day! GME &amp Tesla both ripped, same time tomorrow
Can Tesla stock be the reserve currency?
Bro you keep asking this question on every Tesla post. Do your own DD and invest if you like the company. he made 5k but started with 71k, still good job OP üëç
Tesla adding a cool $400B to their market cap in less than a week.Very cool very real.No bubble here folks, move along.
I'm speechless with tesla
Tesla is a fucking monster
Yeah I‚Äôm not missing out on this Tesla run to 1500$
Tesla please god don‚Äôt stop it feels too good.
Tesla is literally carrying the indices
People with Puts on Tesla praying one of their owners drives a Tesla into a wall
Should I buy Tesla calls today?
You spent 100k on Tesla calls betting it will be the highest it ever will be?? You animal‚Ä¶ congrats
We holding tesla fds overnight boys? I'm up 150% and don't wanna get too greedy.
Tesla 1400 tomorrow?
10k to 40k in 5 trading days on Tesla, LCD, and GME
Tesla gonna do the straight up Dick rocket launch chart tomorrow morning.
I dont know what's more retarded, capping your Tesla gains at $1100/share until 2024, or that I'm mad at a millionaire
Using GME call profits to buy more shares Using Tesla and LCID call profits to buy more GME shares. There's nothing they can do, we're taking every winning play to GME sharesSpy calls? Moar GME shares. Fuck you Shitadel
Tesla is minting new millionaires everyday lol congrats ya fucks
Lol, Tesla doesn't run on steam.  They're electric.
Hertz buy tesla
So the usa economy is just based on tesla now right
If you‚Äôre not in Tesla calls wtf are you doing on WSBs? Lmfao
Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Google to name a few safe bets..
My mom talked me out of the Tesla yolo
&gt Tesla could buy Hertz with all the 400 billion of moneys their market cap just gained.
When I started buying Tesla i spent 25% of my net worth on my first 6 shares. I grew up poor and had to figure this all out myself. You can too, it‚Äôs not too late to find the next big winner. Start depositing consistently, get in a habit of investing regularly and be patient while investing what you truly believe
Tesla repeat from last year?
Tesla has made me 34k in the last 2 hours....and I'm still down thanks to apple
The World Food Organization should just buy Tesla Calls to solve world hunger.
Good day to both have GME and TESLA in my portfolio
One day my kid is gonna ask "daddy, why aren't we rich". And I'm gonna say "cause I was too much of a  pussy to go balls deep into Tesla"
The Tesla calls I got rid of on the 22nd are worth a quarter million right now. I took an $800 profit ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886)
I wanna throw up knowing i sold tesla at 970
Tesla get volatile. Take your 1.2 million when the call is exercised and just wait to buy back on a dip.
Yolo calls on tesla üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ
#LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHTHertz, the **bankrupt rental car company**, claims that they are going to spend 4 billion on Tesla cars.   In the middle of a global pandemic, when Tesla can't even obtain the computer chips they need to make their cars.The Tesla stock price shoots from 800 to 1200 in no time flat, adding like 400 billion dollars in market capitalization.Did I miss something?
He was worth billions decades before he invested in Tesla.. the guy had a business school named after him back in 2008 and he ran an international multi billion dollar IT company. Nice yolo but misleading headline
Tesla needs to split, they will easily become first 1 quadrillion dollar company at this rate.
Someone check on that dude who said he was gonna buy 1 million worth of tesla puts ü§°ü§°ü§°
Someone go check on Burry. Holy shit Tesla
Tesla now accepting $TSLA as payment. üìàüìàüìà
Tesla to **~~Moon ,~~**  Tesla to **~~Mars~~** .....Tesla to **Alpha Cenaturi** ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
Elon Musk offers to sell Tesla stock 'right now' if UN can show how $6 billion would solve world hungerYou know he could actually do this lol
You‚Äôre a fucking legend. Being a huge Bag holding $TSLA Lord is my dream job one day. Good on you for not giving up on Tesla!
Tesla is making me multimillionaire ü§ëü§ëü§ë
Profit taking from Tesla will rotate into AMZN and AAPL by big money
I‚Äôm not big on making money on people losing, unless they‚Äôre Tesla short sellers
who is buying tesla at this price? holy fuck.
Tesla at any price is free money
Tesla about to add spy to its own tesla index
Incoming tesla food cannon!
TESLA PE ratio too low. Only 373? Needs to be at least 1k
Twitter doing Twitter things. Nobody said 6bn would solve world hunger, they took the quote and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù removed the word help. 6bn in taxes that Tesla dodges would help solve world hunger was the gist of it.
They'll will probably buy Tesla and make it $12 B in a year.
Tesla is a hooker that steals money out my wallet when I‚Äôm not looking
Tesla making me nervous
Is Tesla $1300C 11/5 a good buy
Incoming tesla semi truck!
Sounds like it's time for Tesla to announce that 1,000,000 mile battery...
Right now someone is typing how the next crash is inevitable after blowing their account on tesla puts.
Tesla 1200 11/5 call sounds good ?
I thought about buying 1 Tesla put a few days ago but then decided that I wasn‚Äôt retarded
One critical flaw of this model is the assumption that Tesla will crash after the big run-up. It could very will be consolidating and trading sideway at a new high, while you're bleeding money, and shoot up even higher, forcing you to close out. One critical flaw of this model is the assumption that Tesla will crash after the big run-up. It could very well be consolidating and trading sideway at a new high, while you're bleeding money, and shoot up even higher, forcing you to close out.
I‚Äôd be up like $30k right now if I didn‚Äôt sell my got damn Tesla calls!
They‚Äôre making electric cars that people who wouldn‚Äôt get Tesla‚Äôs would want to buy (new electric mustang, new f150). they have a functional manufacturing operation unlike Tesla, they produce like 100x as many cars but have 1/10th the market cap.
Tesla singlehandedly carrying SPY . Elon should be spy ceo
Tesla right now: ‚Äúlisten.. listen.. I am the market now‚Äù
This is absolutely going to make its way to the Tesla investors club subreddit.Interesting fact, the name of that war machine is Grond, the same name of Melkors Hammer. Melkor being the original ultimate evil and Sauron's boss.
God, Tesla has been an insane transfer of wealth for some people.In both directions
Shld I buy lcid or Tesla
Tesla is +62% in 6 months‚Ä¶ on what?
Imaging not being  balls deep into Tesla calls and only having a single call ü§°
*tesla looks at wall street* I am the market now
Same thing people asked with Tesla when their original car was $100k+ ... it's a dumb question. People pay 2-3k for shoes and 50k for watches. Regular old walking around people drop a grand, or more, on a phone every year.No one looks at a Porsche or Ferrari and asked "Oh yeah, nice car, but who can afford it?"
Why did I ever bother diversifying?Should've just park everything on Tesla from day 1.
"The UN says $6B from the world's billionaires could solve a hunger crisis. Elon Musk says he will sell Tesla stock and donate proceeds if the UN can prove that."    Musk calling the UN on their bluff. Interested to see what comes of this, if anything.
Ghost of Bill wang dude stopped posting a lot after buying Tesla puts last week lol
I see and LOTR/Tesla meme. I upvote
tesla bears soooooo fuk lmao
TSLA is literally a money printer. If you‚Äôre not buying Tesla you‚Äôre missing out.
Sold some Tesla 1050s last week for 1000 bucks that are about to be worth 12k. Awesome
This isn‚Äôt an investing sub so be careful. But stock prices are based on sentiment.  Essentially what people are willing to pay. People believe that Elon and Tesla are market leaders.  They believe that Tesla will continue to grow, innovate in other areas e.g.  auto driving software, space, other tech.    So they want to get in early.
At this point tesla going 1500 inevitabily
Tesla 1200 imminent. Looking like another one of its epic runs.
I'm buying Tesla
Do you want to own 100 shares for a total cost of $96,200 or do you want $48,000 cash monies to "invest" with?If you own the shares you'll be able to sell a covered call for premium aka cash monies to "invest" with.A reason to not exercise is since Tesla is near new all time highs it could dip and your shares suddenly are worth less than you paid for them.
This man put 141K into TSLA. Like congrats, but that‚Äôs like 1.5 years of my salary. That‚Äôs just crazy to think I‚Äôm gonna put a year  and a half (and let‚Äôs be honest 3 years for most Americans) into Tesla stock and let it ride. Bro that‚Äôs just nuts what people can do with time and money
Hind sight is always easy. Fore sight on the other hand is hard. Tesla was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I missed apple. Amazon. Netflix. Google. Facebook.. LinkedIn. And I said never again. Palantir and Opendoor are my next frontiers of foresight. I might fail, but I will hold for a decade
Amazing how many people don‚Äôt realize the courage it takes to do this. When OP was buying Tesla wasn‚Äôt much of anything really and had previously near bankruptcies. Now it looks like a no brainer but when it was the best time to buy it looked very risky.
I wish I could go back to summer 2019 and just put everything in Tesla leaps
For as long as people are attributing a value to your product and willing to pay for it. Then that's the value of it. A Peloton is just a bicycle but hey, shit costs Hella money. I'm done buying dips on Tesla to be honest. I do think the valuation is high, but again, high relative to what? To whom? For as long as there is a 1-2M production capacity for each factory and they have 3  right now with potentially 3 more between now and 2030. The safe bet is no other BEV manufacturer has a 20M PRODUCTION PLAN with growth plans of 40% YOY TILL 2030. For as long as that remains the case. I plan to hold
It's incredible hard to explain in simple words what Palantir does but what is incredibly easy to figure out is that nobody else is doing it. When you say that Amazon or Google could eat their lunch if they wanted, it's the same thing people said (and still say) about legacy auto vs Tesla.Palantir offers a suite of digital products that solve the problem of organizing massive data in a meaningful way. A lot of companies pretend to do the same thing but they feel incredibly short. Palantir hires incredibly well and makes some of the best software out there. It's an incredible feat in an era of junky code (of which Google and Amazon and Microsoft are often guilty).
All to LUCID (LCID) new Tesla
lol as of Tesla hasn‚Äôt broken out
Don't laugh. I've never driven a tesla. I belong to a large club of TSLA holders that have never driven one. It'll be a cybertruck when the time comes though
Wasn't easy. Tesla had some bad years in 2015-2019 and will still have some bad years ahead of it. But I believe now. No concerns except an early pre-2030 death of EM.
Nah fam. Wasn't rich when I started buying Tesla, first purchase was for $34 pre-split.  One simply needs to have conviction. Been buying Tesla since 2013. Went all in 2018 ( via a traditional IRA)
Tesla gonna meme to 1.5k by Wednesday
Here is the main thing: most of these stock rallies are driven by hype/excitement mainly coming from retail investors. PLTR does not have that, it does not have the relatability or other tech names and will always be valued at a lower PE ratio.What does PLTR do? Ask 10 people around you and may be 1 person can explain it.How many people here can name one PLTR product? I am not saying company isn‚Äôt good, it‚Äôs a great company with a great business. But it will not be a hype stock or a retail darling stock like tesla or apple. It‚Äôs not relatable for retail.
So you are telling me the 30 shares of tesla I bought for $5000 in 2019 and sold for $15,000 would be 150 shares right now and be worth $160,000?  Dang.
Tesla will make everything before apple even says
tesla will make a phone before apple makes a car
SPY gonna be 470 before Tesla 2000 you heard it here
Tesla could end up at $2000 or $600 by Friday and I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised
Tesla and Ford.
Buy more tesla
Still tesla
&gt The loan shark is a bot. He keeps trying to call you because he has no other purpose in life. If Tesla stock does not open at $1200, it will be the end of humanity as we know it and there will be blood everywhere
For Tesla watch what happens if the stock stops appreciating.  Boom lots of folks will walk.
Exactly. If he only cared about money, he wouldn‚Äôt risk his $200M from PayPal in 2 startups that would likely fail (he sure thought either SpaceX or Tesla would fail, likely even both).
He also had the Tesla patents be open source so others can use it for good. What an evil man. :D
Thinking about buying 1200 Tesla calls, but at the same time I don‚Äôt wanna get fucked. Decisions decisions
It's pretty concerning that the WSB mods are still allowing TSLAQ clowns to post here. This isn't DD, this isn't even a meme, OP is just literally slandering both Elon &amp Tesla and copy-pasting smear phrases from the tweets &amp subreddit of the TSLAQ cult.OP, calling someone corrupt without evidence can get you a lawsuit up your ass and hiding like a coward behind an anonymous reddit account won't help you. I'm sure, like a coward you are, you are still immensely thankful that Elon doesn't even care about your insignificant &amp pathetic life. Elon is content with simply watching your puts get raped every Friday.
Just did a dd post about why I think tesla is going to crash, worth a read, 5x leveraged at ATH this is a new type of retard xD good luck my friend
The ones going to suffer the most are the ones known for being insufferable to work for. I expect Uber would suffer, but from what I understand they spend more on lawyers than engineers at this point.Facebook is *already* suffering from this. Wouldn't be surprised to see Tesla start to have troubles soon. Already most of the engineers I know who would even consider Tesla regard it as "I'll go for two years to get it in my resume and then quit", which clearly isn't sustainable for Tesla.I've heard similar things for Google, but the one guy I know who actually works for Google says it's not bad if you aren't at the central campus, so maybe they can get by.
Tesla literally doesn‚Äôt have PR
I once knew a guy who did Tesla puts ‚Ä¶. Wonder where he is now
WSB says to buy Tesla puts=Tesla to mars
No, no, you don't understand, Tesla is not a car or Tech company, its a cryptocurrency.
Updating my price target on TSLA. By 2030 Tesla will be the sole provider of all goods and services on earth. New PT is $69,420,000 per share. This is only my forecast based on fundamentals.
Because it‚Äôs an idiotic idea that will cause significant damage to the markets and overall economy and will ultimately make it more difficult for him to continue growing Tesla and spacex. You should be against the wealth tax as well if you care about your future at all
Not just the first successful electric car company but **the** company that spurred every other car manufacturer towards electric. No amount of corruption or lobbying can overpower consumer demand. The years of ICE dominance was broken by Tesla and now you have major brands like Volvo announcing their last ICE vehicle will be made in 2025.
OP is probably a car guy. Like one of those dudes who wraps his entire personality around the ability to know how a car works mechanically. I‚Äôve seen people like that act like Musk is personally emasculating them on a daily basis. They see a Tesla as a massive finger to their entire world of ICE cars and just break down like little babies about it.
I am confused why it is still called 'stock market' and not 'tesla market'. I guess they'll change it soon. ü§∑üèª
Well he‚Äôs made a lot of people on here a shit load of money. Some of them life-changing money. I imagine that‚Äôs why they love him. I‚Äôd love him and worship him too if I didn‚Äôt sell my Tesla stock for a loss years ago and never tried again but at this point I‚Äôm just indifferent.
&gt	he doesn‚Äôt build the cars with his own handsDuring the early Model 3 push for Tesla, he actually did join the assembly lines.
&gtHes just another billionaire who only cares about money and fameSeems like you have some kind of preconception of the type of person he is without ever watching or listening to the countless interviews and talks he does.He risked total bankruptcy when both Tesla and SpaceX were in financial trouble and could have bowed out at the time with a massive fortune. Instead he risked it all to keep both companies going because he believes in their missions, green energy future on earth and expanding our species to other worlds.I dont worship the guy, but I like his visions.
I have an active banbet tesla to 750 by next friday. Wanna take the ban now
He pretty much CREATED today‚Äôs Tesla. Saying otherwise is retarded even by WSB standards
LCID is the next Tesla play. Luxury EV, Energy Storage, and they have their own Software. Next stop $100/share
If he‚Äôs in it for the money then why did he take his entire PayPal payment and invest it in the two hardest industries to succeed in? No one had created a successful private rocket company until he did. Also Tesla is the first successful car company in about 70 years and the first successful electric car company. He didn‚Äôt take the easy route.
I think it‚Äôs pretty hard to make that argument, dude‚Ä¶ Jeff Bezos just bought a $500M super yacht‚Ä¶ meanwhile, Elon has sold almost all of his worldly possessions (including houses) and now lives in a 400 sqft manufactured house in Boca Chica so he can spend most of his time working on SpaceX. If you‚Äôre worth $200B, you‚Äôre not worried about making MORE money. There‚Äôs essentially nothing you cannot buy at that point. If Elon ‚Äúonly cares about money‚Äù, why work his ass off 7 days a week and live relatively modestly instead of spending your days living ultra lavish like Bezos and many others? Not to mention, multiple times since becoming extraordinarily wealthy, Elon has put everything he has on the line and risked going into bankruptcy in order to build SpaceX and Tesla. Most of us would never have the balls to do that. People love him because he‚Äôs an innovator and a visionary and he works his ass off. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs Mother Theresa, but he definitely cares about more than money.
What does it take to earn someone‚Äôs ‚Äúrespect‚Äù? Clearly founding multiple billion dollar companies (Tesla, SpaceX, PayPal), creating products people actually want to buy (no one is forced to buy Teslas or use Starlink as far as I know), and persevering to create a company that beat Boeing and Russians in a highly regulated and technical industry isn‚Äôt enough.
He bought Tesla for less than $50 million, it is now worth over $1 trillion.
He is the CEO of a company that made me enough money to pay off my mortgage, school loans and two cars. The competition of Tesla single handedly pushed the automotive industry towards electric. Are you mad he isn‚Äôt going to write you a check? I‚Äôm not even upset about most of his money being in stock and not being taxed.
u/zjz should be working for Tesla, what he's been able to create with VisualMod is quite impressive.That bitch gives more human like responses then half the people here.
My grandma got rekt shorting Nikola Tesla
I hope Lucid, Rivian and whatever other EV manufacturer will have better quality than Tesla.
Tesla is probably the best EV in terms of range and technology but absolutely not the best in terms of quality. In fact they are one of the lowest quality can manufacturers on the market.
Immediate/short term, probably nothing. I think a lot of the dissatisfied Tesla owners have moved on (including us soon) to other manufacturers. As someone who likes competition in the EV space, I hope they have a better service experience than Tesla (which is kind of why we aren't buying another one).I have no direct financial stake in Lucid or Tesla.
According to the article, his wealth comes from a business he built with his wife starting in the 1980's (SHI, https://www.shi.com/ basiclly a CDW competitor)  There is nothing in the story to indicate his parents were wealthy.  In fact is says his family immigrated to the US and and one point he was living in a cockroach infested apartment in New York.The money he is investing in Tesla comes from the successful business he built.
I sold my Tesla stocks for quarterly ETF s because the bank cashier told me they were a safe investment
Do your own DD. Crazy fucks tried making a quantum powered battery didn‚Äôt work. It is like MIT in a battery company. Doesn‚Äôt have to worry about all the shit that Tesla does. Just making a battery that works. Over a million tries before they found one that worked. Like you trying to pick up a prostitute at the bar.
Without looking at historicals, I'd bet that this was in first few months of either 2013 or 2014. I was in a  high-school finance class and we were playing a stock game, I put the 10k I had in tesla and it spiked up to the 120s I believe which made me win the little simulation. Literally adds nothing to this conversation, just reminiscing.
Yes this is wallstreetbets, but it‚Äôs also turned into pump and dump by guys holding heavy bags. If you can find me another play like GameStop and Tesla I‚Äôm 100% invested but from what I‚Äôve seen on here lately is just guys trying to pump and dump or offload their bags.
Tesla needs to gap tf up to 1.5k by Wednesday
Dudes 18 which means he can retire at 50 years old if he where to invest 50k right now into an index fund that tracks the S&ampP 500. That‚Äôs an annual compound of 10% and no additional contributions he will net 1.7 million at the age of 50. If he continues to add to his position let‚Äôs say 500 a month after that, it will equal to about 3.7 million at the age of 50. Now if he waits until the age of 65 he will net around 10 million if the s&ampp average break down is 10%. Or maybe if he finds another good play like Tesla (which are hard to find) he can become a millionaire by his 20‚Äôs but let‚Äôs be honest we don‚Äôt get lucky everyday üòÇ
Facebook - Amazon - Tesla - Microsoft - Apple - Netflix - GoogleFATMANG
Keep going. Don‚Äôt stop. Tesla doesn‚Äôt stop.
Meanwhile Tesla puts catching headshots in the field.
When very popular stocks like Apple, Google, or Tesla have been outperforming for the last decade, it's actually extremely common from some random retail investor to outperform in the index. If you had more than 10% of your portfolio in Apple for any significant period of time you probably crushed the index. However, in times where the popular mainstream stocks lag, the vast majority of retail investors will perform below the index.It is actually very very difficult to evaluate the intelligence vs luck aspect of investing. A lot of people who sound extremely intelligent simply get all of their outperformance from a single bet (ex: being overweight tech in the recent decade). And often they don't even know that is what they are actually betting on. Some people are unknowingly betting on interest rates going down, because they tend to pick leveraged companies, and they have had great tailwinds for the last 40 years. Did they actually pick a ton of winners independently, or have they been blindly betting on yields going down all the time (and they never explicitly stated they believed that)?The only types of funds that you can get a good gauge on are the quant funds that hold \~300 holdings and they are programmed to be neutral across all the major risk factors and correlations (ex: they would be sector and industry neutral, etc). But it's not interesting to analyze them because people like the idea of a superstar investor and they want to pick individual stocks.
Ah so the secret to making 7 billion from Tesla stock is to already be a billionaire.So inspirational!
Ahh the only put money in Tesla and never touch it play.So good.Like a fresh kick to the balls every day.I‚Äôd have more money if I simply never woke up.I know as soon as I invest in Tesla it is going to crash. I don‚Äôt want to hurt all of you.

Tesla is worth something like the next 9 biggest car manufacturers combined.Yet apparently ‚ÄùtSLa isNt ovErvalUeD!!1!‚Äù
Just like Tesla supercedes all automakers, OP supercedes all wife's boyfriends
I sure would love to own 6000 Tesla shares Gadamn. What was your entry?
&gt Tesla is a company that has been around for over 100 years. It was founded in 2003, which means it‚Äôs less than 10% of its lifespan. I highly doubt you will be able to make more money investing in Tesla if you only invest once and forget about it for ten years because there are many other factors at play here such as competition, economic conditions etc‚Ä¶
No, this guy held leaps over the past two years or something. This guy is literally Tesla leap Jesus. To a man, there is nobody here who has played a long call position better than him/u/Anono-mon
He doesn't have 300 billion cash. It's all tied up in Tesla. I wish people understood that, because Teslas valuation is as retarded as this sub
I agree with you, that many companies are playing with their balance sheet to make them look better. But you have give us an example for this. If you mean the regulatory credits for example, Tesla made 2 rows in their balance sheet, including and excluding regulatory credit, for example on page 23 of their Q3 earnings for 2021: Automotive gross margin (GAAP) 28.4%  Automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits (non-GAAP) 25.8%
Tesla would hit $20 if it was ever revealed they played with their balance sheet and had to reinstate their earnings.  It happened with MicroStrategy in 2000 and is likely what started the dotcom crash.
Thoughts on Tesla this week?
Don't forget, this is after they said Tesla wasn't worth a buy.
Why is Tesla moving up today?There's no apparent reason or news. But since you're here, check out these 5 hand-picked stocks by the magnificent motley Fool.
Wealth is just a balance sheet measure on paper. It doesn't mean he actually has $300 billion in his personal checking account. While I'm sure he has access to whatever cash he pleases and then some, I would bet a massive majority of it is in the ownership of his companies.So if Tesla valuation goes through the roof because the market is retarded he's required to cede some of the ownership of the company he started? That hardly seems fair. If the marker tanks does he get it back? Who's ownership do we take to give back to him? I'd argue there's no better reinvestment into the economy than letting Papa Musk own Tesla and watching him change the world.
"buy a total market index." This has worked for me its not sexy and I don't have a Tesla but I am making $'s.
My parents found out how successful I've been trading Tesla and then my dad found out about Lucid and told my mom it's trading at "only" $36.99 - very very "cheap" compare to Tesla and I told them that's not how you value a stock.They're taking out a loan to buy bunch of Lucid shares expecting it to go up 1k/share in a year and I keep telling them that's not how any of these work but they won't listen to me.Help??
If that makes you sleep at night, sure.  SpaceX is doing better and making space cheaper for NASA than anything NASA ever did.  Tesla also jump-started the EV race when everyone else sat on their backsides.Meanwhile, the U.S. government continues to spend trillions of dollars - every year - with zero accountability and trying to distract us from that uncontrolled spending by having us focus on people like Musk that contributed more to the economy, including creating countless high-paying jobs than anything our elected officials ever did.Any perceived money we get from people like Musk will be a drop in the bucket.So yeah, let‚Äôs focus on contracts given to SpaceX to put satellites in space cheaper for your cell phones, because the government can do it so much cheaper.
This is what many villagers with pitchforks just don‚Äôt get.  Nearly all of Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúwealth‚Äù is in equity of Tesla and SpaceX.  Because of that value, banks will give him loans with his stock as collateral.  He could live his entire life living off those loans - not taxable - and either pay off those loans with new loans, or have his estate settle those loans after he passes away.He‚Äôs not evading anything.   People are just jealous.Point your anger at the government for finding any excuse to continue out-of-control spending.  The government does not have a revenue problem.
&gt You're never going to own a Tesla.
A Tesla is sent back from the future to protect Elon Musk. Its CPU is a neural-net processor a learning computer.

At more than $1,000 as of Wednesday, Baron's namesake investment firm holds almost 6 million Tesla shares, on a cost of ownership basis of $42.88 each.
Foool. He doesn‚Äôt need to sell a single share to get cash. Banks line up around his house to give him low interest loans with his Tesla stock as collateral.
Always. I've done a few dozen trades of tesla alone this week and my personal rule is to always move out 25% of profit in cash to the ol bank account.*my main brokerage is with fidelity and i just tossed 1k into RH a week ago to see what i could do and it just kinda exploded...in a good way
What is bad news in the Tesla realm? Ford doubles their pre-orders of a car they already can't produce in anything approaching quantity?  Their dealers start rep'ing their products like they actually believe that Ford supports them for the long-haul? Elon Musk dies of a heart attack or gets called back to the planet he came from? Don't give anybody crazy ideas. After watching all of those videos from Russia with people jumping in front of vehicles for insurance, I can imagine it will eventually happen...all on video too.
At this rate tesla will reach 2trillion market cap by EOM. What a ü§° market.
So Tesla 1500 isn't a meme apparently.
Guys, my portfolio is up 250% this week from switching from a ghey bear to a long dick money bull. It‚Äôs easy, just buy calls on retarded shit that doesn‚Äôt make any sense like Tesla or spy at 460 and BAM! You‚Äôre a fucking genius
Tesla FSD guide:1. Buy 100 TSLA shares2. Wait a year3. Hire a chauffeur
Hes a huge investor in Tesla, he was keeping the price down so he could keep buying.
I hate the "Tesla is different you have to think of it like a tech company" narrative.  Its ridiculous.  Apple, FB, MSFT are all actual tech companies and on average make 10x+ the net income but have similar market caps.  No Tesla is not like a similar Tech company, Big tech prints money.  Tesla on the other hand....
I keep looking at the Tesla chart in disbelief. This run is just absolutely insane, even crazier after how bad things looked in February. I can‚Äôt believe I could have snagged some leaps with it at like 500 lol
Told my boss to fuck off, I‚Äôm a Tesla investor and don‚Äôt need him now. üòé also let my mom know I will be moving out the house and to let me know when supper is ready. Being an investor sure works up an appetite üòã
It‚Äôs simple. Hertz buys Tesla stock, buys cars with Tesla earnings
üëª this is the ghost of my account because I‚Äôm holding Tesla puts for Monday
He bought 2 monopolies and Tesla‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and claims to have unlocked a secret‚Ä¶
So your argument is that other stocks have gone up?If you actually look at Teslas Price to earning ratio it's currently at ~360.  That means that at its current income, it would take Tesla 360 _years_ to earn as much money as it is apparently "worth".Compare that to Amazon which is currently at 58, or Apple which is at 29.In order for Tesla to actually be worth as much as its valuation, it would probably need to displace every other car company combined.  There is no way it isn't overvalued.
Yes, but at $2300 a share Tesla would be the biggest company (in terms of market share) on earth. Could it go higher? Sure. Would it lose what little logical reason it has left? Absolutely.I don‚Äôt care how much of a Tesla bull you are, there is absolutely no way someone can argue a bull case on Tesla being bigger than Microsoft/Apple imo.
If I was paid in Tesla stocks I'd be selling them immediately.  The stock value is high because it's overvalued, it's unlikely to go up much and at some point in the next five years is likely to go down a lot.
Because tesla stock is beyond over-valued.
Tesla bears = ü§°
Exp? Seeing this post makes me want to throw my 24k into a Tesla weekly but with my luck it‚Äôd go down
Tesla autism
No joke lol. I scrolled 3 articles down and saw an article about the Chip shortage affecting auto manufactures. Will Tesla even be able to deliver this and all the others orders?
Anyone buying Tesla calls for $1000 when the shares were around $800 not so many weeks back has made good money.I laughed at $1000... well, fck me I'm wrong, and fck you all for doing so well. Ps: Fck you again...
Retail isn‚Äôt moving Tesla at all, 1 trillion market cap with tens of billions of dollars in shares exchanging hands every day.Retail has actually made a shit ton of money on this one
"More than you can afford, pal.  Tesla"  (...silence...)
Tesla is hands down the hottest company on this planet. This is only the beginning.
I can‚Äôt read. All I seen is Tesla and a rocket in the title. I‚Äôm in!
Imagine being a low level tesla exec hired in 2015 and getting the standard $40,000 worth of stock vesting over 3 years.  Then in 2017 you had good performance and they gave you an equity bonus of another $20,000. Thinking ‚Äúoh this is nice‚Äù and just sitting on it. It‚Äôd be about 1,000 shares, right around $1.1 mill today.  This isn‚Äôt like a ‚Äúoh if I bought Microsoft stock 40 years ago‚Äù scenario, we‚Äôre talking about 6 years.
Tesla call seller huh
Lol so will a lot of people. Tesla definitely going up long term it‚Äôs just too high right now imo
Brah a 4 billion dollar order kicked off a 20% run and added 200 billion to the market cap. For tesla to keep up the growth and to meet expectations over time they are going to need to sell cars to every person on the planet or start making revue from other channels. It‚Äôs way over bought right now. Long term yes it‚Äôs going to run short term I don‚Äôt see how it doesn‚Äôt pull back
Huh. Shorting Tesla is usually such a good bet.
Why do all you people forget the mother fucker literally ‚Äúannounced‚Äù he started shorting Tesla right around the time Tesla was added to the S&ampP? He announces it on Twitter but because Casandra gets his feelings hurt he deletes his comments A LOT!

OP now realizing his math was off and trying to comprehend just how dumb this trade was as tesla closes at a new all time high.
Tesla 1200 EOW
I shorted Tesla at $765 and am being absolutely killed rn
Not to mention how everyone will tear that shit up in a Tesla. Before Teslas you used to have to rent a high performance vehicle for several hundred bucks if you even wanted to have any fun doing burnouts or launches, now simply an entry level electric sedan rental will allow anyone to have this fun. Calls on tire manufacturers.
Isn‚Äôt Burry short at 750 or something though? 1200 seems a lot more reasonable to me. Tesla is way too high and needs to cool off. Some bad news and a tesla crashing into a mom holding a baby while walking in LA and we are back at 850
Have you never been here before? The entire Tesla retail market is retarded. Betting on it to behave logically is therefore retarded. How retarded do you have to be to not see this?
Tesla, not to be outdone by Enterprise, orders 500k Tesla‚Äôs for robo-taxi.  Market cap increases by $100m per car ordered
He‚Äôll be a minnow in no time if he keeps shorting Tesla
Back when people thought Walmart was about to start competing with Amazon I made a list with Facebook, Apple, Tesla, Walmart, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. FATWANG
Have you seen the market before?Feb: Tesla $800 May: Tesla $520
Facebook AppleTeslaMicrosoftAmazon Netflix. No google? Or alphabet as google and double up an A?
Tesla is so good even hertz can‚Äôt afford them.
That moment you realize those Tesla shares you sold March last year would be worth $2.3m today
Not if, but when tesla doubles again, it doesn't seem unreasonable that Apple and Microsoft would also double over that time.  Odds are 5 years from now tesla will trade closer to 3,000 than it would at 600.  Meanwhile you'll lose 500k in cash and also lose out on a couple mill in opportunity cost b/c you bet the wrong way.
Hertz buys call options on Tesla. Hertz puts in orders for 100 thousand cars. Tesla rockets. Hertz sells their options. Hertz has 4.8 billion to buy 100 thousand Tesla‚Äôs.
Fuck it. Let‚Äôs just meme tesla to #1 marketcap company
Tesla uses a ton of stock based compensation. Their cashflow would be heavily in the negative if they didn't.
Tesla pays its employees? I thought they were all working for free to be entered into a lottery for a 40 acre homestead on Mars.
Well considering they no doubt agreed on the current price by the time they can deliver the cost will have gone up significantly meaning if hertz does back out Tesla can sell those cars to waiting customers at what will be the current and higher sell price‚Ä¶ seriously I see no way Tesla doesn‚Äôt end up on the moon. Shit this deal could propel the stock all the way to starman.
Once Hertz figured out a plan with Tesla, they YOLO-ed. It was a very good risk to take, kudos to mgmt. Anything Elon Musk is a momentum play. He's the zeitgeist of the current times, like Jobs, Lucas, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Tesla (himself) going all the back to DaVinci. Smart+right time, right place. Doubt this deal will execute completely. I see only 30K cars delivered out of this deal.
replace Facebook with Tesla and call it TAANG
Bro I fucked shorted Tesla at $765 and am still waiting to cover it
&gtcheapest thing to keep on the roadI can see that.&gt even up to 200,000 milesUhh... We still talking about a Tesla? These come from the factory with some of the worst initial quality in the market?&gtThey also hold their resale value like crazyI have a strong feeling this might be the only reason the first statement is remotely true - if you do not factor in the battery replacement around 150k miles. If you sell it with a new battery then yeah, $15 - 20k has been put into it, so the resale value price looks great but the actual resale value as a % of total purchase + maintenance is trashed.
Hertz uses gains from Tesla FDs to buy 100,000 Teslas
actually tesla would just go up another 10% because they'd have more cars to sell
Correct, they‚Äôll never see a downside from battery degradation even if the batteries degrade more than Tesla predicts. Carmax, Carvana and the like will buy them from Hertz en masse
&gteets of Teslas show that they are the cheapescant wait to see how rental fleet of tesla turn out. customers running out of electricity in the middle of nowhere, etc
Tesla would moon because now they won't have to deliver.
For only 200 dollars a day you too can rent a tesla from a shitty rental company.
They are (presumably) going to have Hertz chargers which are likely Tesla chargers with a hertz sticker on the front
they bought tesla calls before the announcement
Hertz paid everyone in full because it turned out they weren't really bankrupt at all, so it wasnt really a restructuring of debt.   They filed because the market for used cars crashed at the beginning of Covid, so they got margin called on their credit lines (secured by their rental cars).  However, the used car market then spiked to all time highs, so the margin calls went away and they were able to go back to business as usual.  Hertz usually buys around 500,000 cars a year.  They just are moving their purchases from other brands to Tesla.
Tesla in a nutshell.
*throws pocket coins at the Tesla salesman*"Hertz, don't it?!"
So you discovered tesla
Apes use Tesla profits to buy themselves a  Tesla. Tesla quarterly report reflects more sales and deliveries. $TSLA continues to moon. Smart Apes who bought more calls make more money. Smart Apes buy 2nd Tesla . Cycle continues until all cars are Tesla and all apes are rich.
I don't have any Tesla, but for those of you that do, thank you for putting the entire market on your back and carrying us this day.
Time to buy those Tesla 1100‚Äôs!!!
Just got back from my ban bet (Tesla $750) lol
My ban bet expires in a few hours. Tesla to 1200 eow was juat a dream. See y‚Äôall fuckers later
On Tuesday me and my friend talking bout lucid will be future tesla. That njght i was listening to lucid dream song. Wednesday morning i saw the news about first delivery and saudi deals. Option chains otm was cheap 0.04-0.05 for 35c. Its like all the sign to tell me to go for it. But i paperhanded and sold all my x100 35c for 5500, which now is at 38k. Now i am crying like a baby
Only thing more retarded than buying Tesla is Tesla putsYou deserve it dumbass
gg lost all my money to tesla puts this shit is just so retarded its unbelievable
Fuck I'm getting banned in a few hours.Put a banbet for Tesla to reach 999 today when it was at 1087. It hit 1001 which means I was 0.10% away from fucking winning.Granted I secured 200% profits from my puts but it looks like my account is going on a vacation for a week or two. See you then boys.Edit: If I delete my banbet comment, do I still get banned? :D
Tesla needs to grant my wishes once in a lifetime make me a 10 bagger
They‚Äôre going to use a trillion of it to buy Tesla calls.
Tesla is running straight to $1.5T cap before years end. Cry about it
i cant wait to baghold tesla at 1080 for another 5 months when it drops below 700.

&gt	Traders are swarming the market for Tesla Inc. options to bet on a continued stock rally.&gt	Almost one out of every two dollars spent in the U.S.-listed options market through Wednesday went to Tesla options, according to Cboe Global Markets data. On Monday, traders spent more money on Tesla bets, in what's known as options premium, than they did on every single other option in the market combined. There are more than 5,000 stocks and exchange-traded funds to trade.Are you ready?
‚ÄúAlmost one out of every two dollars spent in the U.S.-listed options market through Wednesday went to Tesla options‚ÄùI believe its mostly, if not all, you guys.

Can someone pls explain to my dumb brain why op lost money on tesla calls?
People can no longer afford iPhones or cheap shit from amazon, but everyone can afford a 50k tesla ü§°
cant confirm but I believe OP believes rules change in November in regards to how collateral is calculated for a lot of hedge funds and tesla bonds are rated as BB or something meaning they no longer qualify as collateral so hedge funds need to drop tsla and buy things like Berkshire hathaway to stave off margin calls.
I‚Äôm a licensed advisor and have been doing this six years.  Today I saw Tesla 500p 11/5 coming through for practically nothing and said fuck it and bought some. Despite Tesla rising nearly 4 percent today my puts are up over fifty percent. I have no idea why this is happening.
PTRA has busses on the roads across the US and Canada. The key is not to compete with  giants like Tesla/Ford/GM but to find areas where they dont operate
Lucid isn't just about cars. One of the biggest things they are going to be doing is building energy storage systems. They purposefully built their car batteries to be replaced at 70% battery life and put into energy storage where it will have a longer life. This company is only going sky high. They have already started building out their facility for the next phase. And, the product is better than tesla.
This position does more accurately value Tesla but you're still going to get fucked because Tesla valuation is randomly generated on any given day
It doesn't need to go to $750. It just needs to go down enough at a certain point before their expiry date that someone else will buy the put for a higher value than they did. That or IV goes up significantly for any reason.That is all countered by Theta decay but seeing as tesla is at an insanely high value it's not necessarily a bad play.
LCID will hit 60 before it ever hits 33 again, now is your last chance to hop onTesla runs 70% of the time on back to back days, lcid will be the same
I hope they were covered or things might get worse. This is a real move.  Cars are coming off the factory line and Tesla just popped over a trillion dollar valuation. People are seeing this as the closest competitor to and next Tesla at this point.
Fixing a bumper+headlight is 10K at a certified tesla shop.
How much was Tesla worth before it had delivered 100 cars?
Except when Tesla was created, there was no other Tesla. Now with Lucid and all other EV start ups there is a huge $1T gorilla in the room. And congrats to them for actually bringing a product to market. So they'll soon be 'revenue' and stop being 'pre-revenue'.Look, Lucid, Rivian, and Bollinger are all going to sell every car they make. And Ford will sell all their MachE's and Lightnings. But how many is that? What are their bottlenecks and how large are they? Lucid wants to ramp past a low-volume car into the mass market? OK. Do they have 30GWh of cells to do it with? And very VERY importantly, is what is the plan on becoming profitable? How long and how much cash? What's the roadmap?TSLA is what it is not because of the 367k deliveries of 2019 or the 500k of 2020 or the \~850-900k of 2021. They're this way because they have the clearest path to millions and 10's of millions, dominating the global market for the decade.
Betting against Elon? What could go wrong lol, imagine Enterprise announces they are also buying Tesla for their rental fleet lmao.
You should definitely sell the Tesla, payoff the $10k negative equity and buy a $10k used car. Then the remaining $5k goes into a savings account for emergencies
According to the elon musk book circa 2015, tesla makes very little on repairs compared to all the other manufacturers.
we like lucid!!! EV competition is good!! GO LUCID AND TESLA!!!
I would suggest owning all of them Nio, Tesla and Lucid and just let it grow. I see the biggest benefit of the swapping is not the ‚Äûfast charging‚Äú it‚Äôs that in 2-3 Years you just get a better developed battery in it by still owning the same car. If you want this with any other brand you need to buy a new model. And as we now the batteries right now are progressing fast.
IMO, they appear to make a better product than Tesla. I‚Äôve seen way to many videos of shaky plastics in Tesla‚Äôs.
Tesla hasnt dipped since may and im still out here buying puts like a fucking idiot i hope a car rides over my bitch ass
Huh, I didn't know OP likes to have has ass gaped by a Tesla.
I don‚Äôt know. I like the stock. I drive my Tesla by it everyday so I bought a few ü¶ç
Dude in my management class: ‚ÄúThere are some really great electric companies bursting through right now, like Tesla and Nikola.‚Äù
Tesla doesn't do battery swaps because it's more efficient structure and cost wise to have an integral structural battery. Skateboard pack swaps are obsolete
and I'm to fucking retarded to buy Tesla calls
LCID is a long term hold. It is not Tesla however it is an alternative to Tesla for those that prefer healthy competition.
So Tesla go up. Hertz execs got calls that need printing
#Lcid is just starting baby. If you missed out on tesla,  get in now.This is the future of ev cars
People need do stop saying every other ev makers will be the next Tesla. There‚Äôs no next Tesla, Tesla is the next Tesla. Why would the stock be in triple digits as soon as next quarter? They are only just deliver their first batch of cars. Also don‚Äôt forget these cars are ~$150k each. How many people can afford it? How much sales do you expect LCID to make to warrant a triple digit stock price as soon as next Q?? Maybe you should google global luxury car sales numbers. They are incredibly small, and LCID has to compete with legacy luxury auto manufacturers. Brand loyalty is definitely a thing. Do you expect LCID to magically take all the sales away from Audi, Benz, BMW, Porsche? Pushing EV adoption is all about making EVs cheaper and more affordable, not the other way around. The $150k+ market is so incredibly small, even if you lower the price to $100k, the market is still incredibly small. LCID is just starting to deliver their first batch of cars due to delays after delays. The CEO promised they‚Äôd deliver their first car by summer when they announced their merger, it got delayed because they wanted to get it right, and that‚Äôs good but this brings the next question. How are they going to scale? Tesla has already been through that pain, not LCID, in fact  they are even having trouble delivering their minuscule orders. Not to mention various other problems they will run into once they start scaling. I‚Äôm neutral on LCID, and certainly don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll hit triple digit stock price anytime soon, but good luck to all you LCID Bulls.
I disagree with this because at that level Tesla will start bumping into nationalism, at which point China and other governments will just start stealing assets and blocking Tesla with non-tariff barriers.To get to $3tn at a long term PE of 20, Tesla needs to generate earnings of $150bn per year.If Tesla is making $10k per car in pure profit in an ideal mass production situation it needs to sell 15m cars per year.The 2019 global sales of Mercedes+Audi+BMW 'luxury cars' were 6m.So Tesla would need to completely replace those sales in every nation and then double it. It's not impossible (I still believe that Tesla iPhoned the car market and is awesome) but unlikely to happen without nationalist pushback.I think Tesla was a steal at $600 earlier this year, but it's long term cap is below $3tn.
&gt BMW has cars on lots sitting there for awhile and tesla is on backorderThat sounds like BMW has their production &amp supply chain running very efficiently.BMW CEO never had to sleep at the factory to get production sorted out.I'm balls deep in TSLA. But I'm not tarded enough think that TSLA will replace every car maker.Every single day the Tesla shills come out and compare Teslas growth to GM, Ford, Chrysler, BMW, Benz, VW etc.We all know that Tesla will be the downfall of SOME car makers. But not ALL car makers.Also comparing TSLA market cap with other OEMs is worthless because it doesn't consider debt obligations.Tesla is funny funded and has no long term debt. Their market cap is exactly that.VW for example has ~$190B in very low interest corporate debt. There is a reason that TSLA was funded by venture capital, because of the risks involved.While VW group is massive, with a fantastic credit rating and &gt$300 billion in assets. So when VW needs to build a new plant, they don't turn to venture capital, or dilute shares, or peddle on twitter for $100 pre-orders. They simply sell senior notes at low yield 10+ years out.
I‚Äôm in on Lucid and Nio. No one can compare to them right now. Lucid‚Äôs future will be unfolded once those cars start hitting the ground. Tesla tried to do similar batteries like NIO and failed. NIO has made it work. Both have a longer run than Tesla before needing another charge.
Ford is the poor man's Tesla
The 4680 format was in house by tesla.  Panasonic also has a test line using the format, which is what they are announcing.
Actually, it has five times the capacity, not five times the duration, the car won't go five times it's current range, the battery will simply be capable of hold a larger charge, Tesla will decrease the amount of weight of the batteries in the car.
I will not fomo into Tesla. I will not fomo into tesla
I guess Tesla new floor is 1064
Brah how is Hertz gonna afford all those vehicles. At this point I‚Äôm convinced they are just trying to pump Tesla
LCID and tesla looking strong
Morning brief says Tesla 3000
So Tesla isnt a car company except when it‚Äôs time to make financial comparisons huh?
Cathy sold a bunch of tesla last night and got in on hoodThey upgraded the price target to 1300
because if tesla gonna pump. Elon gonna pay more of unrealized gain tax. So Jpow connect printer to tesla stock and pumping it so Us could get money back wit interest from Elon tax.
‚ÄúTesla more profitable than GM or Ford!‚Äù‚Ä¶if you don‚Äôt look at profit but this completely different thing instead.
Tesla not giving up this week
Tesla is the market apparently
While they're at it, why don't they go full ape and just say "10 million is our floor"Tesla can't even satisfy the current high demand. How are they going to provide 200k cars?
Tesla ripping higher already. Infinite money glitch unlocked
My Tesla calls are going to go from  down $1100 to up $1300
Calling it, everything red except Tesla, then super green dildo at power hour
Someone is heavily invested in Tesla.....
Tesla is driving me crazy HOW CAN IT GO UP SO MUCH
55% of all options are in tesla. FIFTY FIVE
That's not reality though,  is it? Thier profit margin is like 7%, where tech margins are 35+%. Nearly 90% of the revenue from Tesla is from their cars.  What tech are they selling?
Toyota has been fighting back against EV popularity. They're far behind and scared of tesla. As they should be.
*Taps microphone* Tesla.
Tesla will reach ATH tomorrow or I'll eat a can of waterchestnuts.
Nearly 90% of Tesla's revenue comes from their cars, right? Are there other car makers or start ups that are showing promising tech? Lucid, Rivian, Ford?   What happens when Lucid and Rivian's start ups fail, because frankly manufacturing cars is super hard to stay solvent (see Tesla's journey)?  Their companies and tech become very cheap to buy out right. Do you think that Toyota, the largest automaker in the World, might be interested in heading into the EV game with every nation heading toward carbon neutral?    Tesla is not a moat. It had competitors in it's major revenue class that can and will out perform and out manufacture Tesla.   I don't hate Tesla at all. I think their stock price is extremely over valued because of hype nerds like yourself. Also, you might want to check out how many shares Telsa's issuing. You're being diluted constantly.
People act like Toyota is just going to sit back and let Tesla become the biggest automaker in the World. Sure. When Lucid, Rivian, and whatever other EV tech becomes pennies on the dollar from their failed start ups, they'll snatch it and scale it.  Recall that Toyota bought all the tech for the Prius from GM, who didn't have a need for it at the time. Toyota bought the Prius....
tesla is being priced at an expected 50% growth rate for 5 years. if the price didn't change the PE would be between 14 and 15 in 5 years.
In 2020, Ford sold about 4.2 million cars. Tesla sold just under 500K. I think your percentage is a little off‚Ä¶
!banbet TSLA 1070 1d or i will take a Tesla tequila shot from a shoe üëû
Burry stopped shorting Tesla
Big Tesla fan and big upvote from me. Don't every be afraid to call out absurdity, even if its from the ones you admire.
I‚Äôm not touching Tesla. SpaceX though, I can‚Äôt wait to blow all my money on that when they finally announce its IPO.
Naw bruh, you meant‚Ä¶next Monday. Tesla to $1,250 monday.
lol....comparing luxury cars to regular cars.Look at BMW Q2:  [https://www.bmwgroup.com/content/dam/grpw/websites/bmwgroup\_com/ir/downloads/en/2021/q2/BMW-Group-Halbjahresbericht-2021-EN.pdf](https://www.bmwgroup.com/content/dam/grpw/websites/bmwgroup_com/ir/downloads/en/2021/q2/BMW-Group-Halbjahresbericht-2021-EN.pdf)6800 GAAP profits / carAlso, BMW is only valued at 70 B instead of 1250B on a diluted basis.BMW also sell twice as many cars as Tesla
They make 48% of the amount of vehicles as Ford. Ford's market cap is $68B. Tesla is at $1T.Market Cap / Vehicles produced:Tesla- $1M/carFord - $32k/carNone of it makes sense.
Friend of mine just bought *a ton* of Tesla.He still doesn't understand why I told him he's retarded.
It's the opportunity cost that makes these cults into vampires. Tesla went up the entire value of gamestore multiple times in the last three months.
For real. Stock only 1100 when ONE SINGLE TESLA costs 30x that MINIMUM
I'm not going to laugh when Tesla pops. The unfortunate reality is that when it pops, a lot of other over inflated things will also pop and even if I've avoided them the cascading effect is going to devastate the market. Someone is going to have to pay for all the damage their wild party has done and I guarantee you it isn't going to be the partiers who will all scatter the moment things start to turn.
Can we just all be $TSLA gang. Like just thinking about Tesla makes you happy, come on admit it.
Tesla reaching ATH tomorrow
Tesla FTW
Tesla gonna open at 1100 or what?
Fk everything else. There's only 3 things you need.Shiba inu TeslaGoogle
Well had the opposite, diamond hand my Tesla calls wayyyyy otm and sold for a mega loss at close. Still sad as fuck
Yup, if they are able to do that then they would be extremely profitable. But right now what they make in a quarter is what apple makes in a week so they‚Äôre not really comparable at all. I‚Äôm just saying that there‚Äôs actual justification for apple being valued the way it is while Tesla‚Äôs valuation is based completely on what it could be some day. Right now based on Tesla‚Äôs profits they should not be at a 1 T market cap it‚Äôs all hype.Not saying the hype won‚Äôt come true though, if I ever make good money a Tesla is one of the first things I‚Äôll buy
Until Tesla has a 100,000 PE ratio it won‚Äôt be overvalued
Apple is actually extremely profitable though, Tesla not so much
If Tesla was going to sell off, it would have done so today. Today was all about consolidating and getting ready for another run up. Some people took their profits, some funds shifted shares elsewhere, but nobody is selling Tesla yet. Everyone in the world knows the price is going up, it‚Äôs all about how high it goes before this friday
Ford has battery capacity to build 40k f150 lightnings/yr.  Ford recently dedicated a lot of capital to stretch that to 80k by 2024.Ford is building one battery factory that will let them get to 700k EVs by 2027-2028.Tesla is planning for 20 million units production by 2030.And that pretty much sums up Tesla share price.
Are we really gonna wake up to tesla at 1100?! Jesus elon
Imagine becoming a poor buying Tesla options.
Tesla 1200SPY 460 By OpenParty ain't over yet bois!
Tesla stock is a literal money printer' bought leaps last week and I'm already up 45K Thank you big daddy Elon ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è
Are you sure your math is right? The price in 2013 was $7-$40 depending on the month, counting if you bought at the max in October 2013, for $1000 you get around 25 shares.But Tesla did a 5:1 split last year, making those 125 shares. So around $129k right now.So in case you forgot about the split and you think shares are worth the same, the 38k is actually $190k.Sorry for your loss.
And Tesla profits are just getting started. Tesla has a ton of lagging factory capacity (built or partially built factory space not yet producing cars but will be in the coming months).Tesla is going to be a money printing machine.
Lol this is why I laugh when my finance friend tells me how the market is all about fundamentals all while he buys GME and Tesla.The market is just a popularity contest, and Tesla is the cool kid who gets voted class President.
I'm balls deep in Oct 29 $16 calls. WeeeeeeeFord's the new Tesla
Berk is going to be selling insurance to people with houses on Mars centuries after Tesla goes belly up trying to just get there.
A 470 PE ratio is insane. For it to reach say a 25 PE ratio (technology company level), they need to increase earnings per share by 20x WITHOUT stock price going up. Or price must fall 95% for this current level of earnings.To reach the PE ratio of a car company like Toyota (10x) they will need to raise their earnings per share by 47x  WITHOUT stock price going up. Or stock price fall  98% for this current level of earnings. We won't bring up Ford.At this point to be justified Tesla will need to DOMINATE the entire car and truck industry and sell them at a similar profit level as iPhones while also having hyper profitable things like Apple's App Store where they get a 30% cut out of everything. Right now, the cars are profitable (especially the expensive ones) but not THAT profitable and don't sell enough while also not having anything hyper profitable like App Store.
Now imagine how valuable it will be if Tesla sold 20% of the cars those companies make. The PE ratio will be 42069x!
Tesla could take over every countrys government and force everyone to buy 5 Teslas and they would still be overvalued
Wonder what if Tesla investors are buying Tesla thinking they are getting space exposure. (ironically google owns like 5% of SpaceX and has had amazing performance recently).
&gtTesla has a bright future.That entire future till the heat death of the universe was priced in at 600$.
Tesla to the moon. The future trillionaire meets his future minimum wage high school drop out fast food worker.
lol fundamentals have not applied to Tech stock since the beginning of this century. and people still don't realise this.. and tesla is a tech company as it's forefront of a new industry &amp#x200Bi'm just waiting for papa Elon to buy facebook and close it down for the meme
This is my favorite type of Tesla valuation justification.  Tesla can leverage XYZ that isn't actually part of Tesla and is just some other shit Musk is hyping at the moment.  Legally, SpaceX is a separate company and cannot give Tesla any kind of special IPO/Starlink/Giganonsense deal based on their fiduciary duty to the 52% of non-Musk investors in SpaceX.   Justifying Tesla's value by saying Musk will commit fraud is common.  Newsflash-Musk isn't going to jail to prop up your investment.  He has repeatedly said Tesla is overvalued.
Is tesla splitting again?
I sware, Tesla probably wouldnt still be a company if it wasnt for the rocket ship emoji.
I bought in on Tesla at 370 something pre split.I just ordered My new House.
I'm fairly certain Mr. Tesla died in 1943
EV credits account for basically a rounding error. Youre not up to date on Tesla and their future.
JUST CLIMB OR DIE ALREADY TESLA
HOLY SHIT TESLA THE SLOW BLEED IS EVEN WORSE THEN JUST FALLING DOWN!
The ‚ÄúT‚Äù in Tesla stand for trillion. Wait until the Tesla œÄ phone come out and they will eat Apple lunch
Yea but then Tesla wouldn't b entitled to spacex's profits even though they might have the same ceo
Yeah but Berkshire Hathaway sounds old as fuck, grandpa, tesla is new and trendy. All the cool kids are doing it!
Tell me Tesla is a cult without telling me Tesla is a cult üëÄ glad I‚Äôm apart of it lol
Yep, spacex will have nothing to do with Tesla stock.
Tesla only goes up. You are more likely to get assigned on your covered calls and lose the remaining upward value in your protective put.
Not likely. It's just priced in with the assumption that Elon is going to exclusively sell Tesla's to all the people in his upcoming Mars colony.Seriously though, still not likely. I mean Tesla is volatile as shit, but it's not really priced as a car company. To me it's valued more as a tech company with Starlink and other non-IPO factors that there aren't any good ways to directly invest in. In other words, this is being treated as a valuation of Elon, not Tesla. Should something happen to Papa Musk it would probably tank pretty hard, but as long as he's around people want to be invested deeply in anything he's doing.
Can't pass comment on my valuation until I've seen an Autism Quotient sample from both companies ... then I will invest according to the factor loadings. Tesla has got to be punching at least a 42+ on that. Goldmine.
Tesla/SpaceX is the real life Weyland-Yutani corporation, change my mind.
Tesla has a bright future. Whereas Berkshire sells underwear and car insurance. Two things that the average WSB ape doesn‚Äôt use.
Tesla is Love. Tesla is Life.
Is Tesla the ultimate rug pull to screw small investors?
Tesla is a religion at this point.
Tesla will be the whole market soon. Fuck companies. Tesla is everything
Elon can literally send Tesla up 10% if he just tweets a picture of shorts
And to think that the energy part of Tesla is still lacking.
TESLA TO $1100
If tesla spikes to 1100, spy should be legally required to go to 459 according to article 4 section 14, subsection 16-B, which reads as follows: ‚Äúfuk u bers spy go uppy‚Äù,  and continues in subsection 16-E ‚Äúbers fuk tesla moon‚Äù. I think there is more in the bylaws but the precedent is clear.
Tesla is about to make a run again.
Just bought $18k worth of puts on Tesla. $1000p expiring next Friday and the one after. I‚Äôve literally never done something so dumb in my life.
Now do Tesla
I‚Äôve successfully lost 50% on my Tesla weekly $1170 calls. I‚Äôm trying to lose money on purpose btw. Don‚Äôt follow me down this rabbit hole
Shibu money going off right now. Ban me I don‚Äôt give a duck it‚Äôs doing better than my Tesla calls
Tesla is gonna announce they have moved their suckomatic gawk gawk ultra instinct pp demolisher into production and go to 2200 tomorrow, you heard it here first.
PLEASE don't dump tesla. I'm begging you
Tesla is breaking the market.
TESLA baby make my day
Is there a club for I regret investing in anything other than tesla?
Playing tesla is basically buying thousands of dollars worth of contracts that can go to 0 or double in minutes
Tesla 1200‚Äôs get your Tesla 1200‚Äôs
300 American tesla calls at 720 strike would roughly be worth $9,000,000 just in intrinsic value right now.
Tesla calls?
Tesla ban bets going to be taking out people left and right
$TESLA üöÄ $1150
Tesla you beautiful bitch
Maybe not today, but soon.33B market cap, \~2B annual revenue and \~3B annual expenses, P/S somewhere in Tesla ballpark. Not good for a company that has growth issues.
The amazing thing about the split is that it encourages shorts. They see follow on appreciation as being retail driven, so they short it. Tesla does well, the shorts get vaporized Splits have that added benefit
Stay tuned I made a 100k bet on Tesla calls
If Tesla does a 10:1 stock split, I‚Äôm putting all of my life savings in it
Uber X Hertz X Tesla baby

Tesla gunna run today again lol
Not quite‚Ä¶.his original average is 4x that because Tesla split 4/1 so that‚Äôs his split adjusted price average. Original cost is 46x4 or 184$. Kinda like how Buffett‚Äôs Apple position is a split adjusted price of like $32 and his KO position is like $3.50 split adjusted.
Tesla $1,150 EOD
I‚Äôm now bullish on Tesla. Im changing my price target from $750 to $1,400 in 2 weeks. My analysis concludes Tesla going up 5-10% everyday
Who‚Äôs the glue eating retard buying Tesla at $1000+
Imagine owning a Tesla and being like holy shit, a fucking hurricane‚Ä¶. I had no ideaPeople that get swept in hurricanes are poor as shit with no where to go.OP might be a fucking retard
Yolo on TSLA like a degenerate. Chart looks sketch but it‚Äôs gonna get spicy. Goldman Sachs upgrades usually hit different. Ron Baron on CNBC PM these were his comments in his Q3 parter letter: Tesla delivered 241,000 units in the period, a 73% increase over last year. And this growth is before new facilities open in Berlin and Texas and capacity upgrades are implemented in China and California. Consolidation of chemistry materials should enable battery production to outpace vehicle growth. This higher production should lead to the energy storage business becoming more impactful for the company over the coming years and provide even more upside for current shareholders. Tesla continues to present strong deliveries growth and a meaningful improvement in profitability despite a complex supply-chain environment.
Holy shit you guys we are fucked. My friend Phil just sent in the group text *"What do you guys think about Tesla?"* The last time he asked this question it dropped 20% in a week and the stock market crashed. Everything he touches turns to absolute dogshit instantly. I have seen this man make Gold tank before. Ye have been warned!
I almost turned 5k into 130k on Tesla call options but I got greedy with the limit price and my order never filled last week. Fuck man

Tesla tomorrow: $900 or $1100?
I am a little retard for holding Tesla 1200 but I still got 3 days
Anyone else got Tesla 10/29 1130c they holding still
So that 18 year old kid who bought the Tesla calls posted an screenshot where he was up 47k, over $50 dollar per contract. That shit closed at $12.10, since is so close to expiration date it would be lower tomorrow, and his average cost ~$16  each.  I guess the saying of if it is good to post is good to sell is not being repeated enough here üíÄ
Tesla‚Ä¶ please ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Realizing half this sub is people buying 1600c 10/29 Tesla.
I might actually buy my first share of Tesla if they announce a split
Probably some ape on here thought I'll take the mill I just made off my tesla and dwac yolo and put it in a safe stock like BRK.  He'll wake up tomorrow with 3 shares and 984,512 on margin.
they're not carrying equal weight though. The nerd sits alone in his Tesla while the Lambo has girls in it
&gt Google is a search engine, and Tesla is an electric car company.
I tripled my account today day trading Tesla. Yolod into Hood. Gonna probably die tomorrow. Is what it is.
Lost 25k holding tesla for 15 minutes too long lol
Tesla is leading the charge to drag the global car industry kicking and screaming into the future. Do you think the big auto makers would be where they are now in EV development without Tesla‚Äôs push?
First SPY call this month!It was never once in the green![crashed the market](https://ibb.co/z6vk0D2)I also bought some Tesla at $1080Bears, I am your new leader. Come, let us discuss real estate ETFs
Remember when Micheal burry shorted 1.1 million Tesla shares ü§°
It is true, but when does Tesla stop being such a sub par car on the inside? I‚Äôm usually unimpressed every time I get in one.
They didn't realize Tesla was about to have access to unlimited capital.
TESLA SHOOT UP TO $1,100 TOMORROW YOU WHORE
Sick I just bought $2 worth of Tesla stock on Robinhood see you on the other side brotha
Tesla will easily be a $2500 stock in 5 years.  Don't worry about short term fluctuation.
I can't believe Tesla got memed into a trillion dollar company. Absolutely insane.
Haaaaaalp I sold my wife and kids and went all in Tesla @ 1094. What should I do
If tesla breaks 1100 today i will suck my own dick
Tesla power hour come on!!!
Fuck the tesla, vanlife or my new favorite, Box truck stealth homes!  Have a problem fix it without shipping it to California and save 100% on property tax by living at cosco.

Fed believes tapering stimulus is needed. SPY hits 50 quadrillion, Tesla hits 98 Quadrillion dollars for first time.
That's because the market knows exactly how much Lockheed Martin is worth: $65 billion in revenue per year.Conversely, the market is still trying to understand what Tesla is worth. If you went back 10 years ago and said Tesla should be worth $50 billion, that was crazy too (they were valued just south of $2 billion). I read so many articles saying "You'd be stupid to buy Tesla, the auto industry is impossible to break into, they will most likely be bankrupt in 5 years."And here they are still, 10+ years later.Investing in Tesla is basically refuting fossil fuel. You think that the entire industry will eventually be replaced, and that Tesla is the company best-positioned to take advantage of that.
Fuck me not buying Tesla after his Joe Rogan debacle‚Ä¶I figured he was unhinged and it was going to implode.  Man, I was so wrong.But I didn‚Äôt have the cash to lose at that point in time.So what‚Äôs the next Tesla!?!?
Holy shit. Sold dwac at open Monday all ind TeslaSold today and all ind gme calls, 5k to 30k in 2 days. GME calls fkn rippin rn!
BrehShut up, buy Tesla FD's, and lose everything That is what we do
The PE ratio is very high. There is a *lot* of optimism baked in to the market price of this stock. I like Tesla but will not be buying any shares at the current price.
A Tesla split is happening alright. Bulls are getting split wide open
Tesla usually does about 2x its prior high so that would mean the pump will end at about $1800
Tesla got a $4 billion order and their market cap went up over $100 billion. Funny.
Michael is it you? Dont be sad my friend we all been through Tesla Puts. &lt3
Somebody sold Tesla yesterday
Anyone else feel the tesla / hertz news was bull shit ? Either it was a handshake deal or it‚Äôs going to be 10k cars a year over 10 years  if they stay in business. The pump was way too high for that
If Tesla could get to like $1200 by end of day, that would be pretty neat
Lol that‚Äôs okay, no need to give me a cut. I find bounce/reject levels during premarket based off volume walls and fib levels. Wait for Tesla to move to the general range of the bounce/reject region &amp buy calls or puts based off that. Sell a few minutes later. Max hold time is like 20 minutes
Who bought Tesla at the top? Show yourself.
Tesla creating a lot of long term investors
I can't believe all the people who made money on Tesla are opting for a lambo. The least you could do is become loyal to the brand.
Even if tesla would have 100% market share, it's still too much marketcap.It's that simple ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The Tesla bears are getting in at $1050 and up‚Ä¶
Lol at the guy on the front page who boasted his Tesla calls and said he wasn‚Äôt selling until Tesla hit $1100 ü§°
I agree. I‚Äôm reading through these comments and I see how $TSLA is bashed. And through it all, I‚Äôm over here banking on my 4000 shares I purchased at $25 per share back in 2010. I‚Äôm loving my gains. And once they split, I‚Äôll buy more. Just yesterday alone I made a cool million. I‚Äôm riding this out till 2030 or Mars. And all the haters can stay on Reddit bitching and whining about Elon, Tesla &amp SpaceX, or Starlink or Boring, or Nuerolink, etc etc.
I mean... in 2019 Tesla wasn't in great shape so the quote would be accurate
You think Tesla is showing their cards? Really? You think they don‚Äôt have calculators to do things you do with calculators like calculating things?
Ah $1,040 Tesla. My mortal enemy
Ok if Tesla holds this support and once the mcD converges it should do a cool run. Let‚Äôs hope he holds. SOMEONE HOLD ME PLS üò≥üò±üò≥
I've always been baffled by the mega-bears.It's the hottest company in the world, with hugely desireable iconic products that are years ahead of the competition, massive patent and IP assets, each car sold at a profit... frankly I can't really see any avenue for Tesla to go out of business even if they tried... and professionals look at that and think "zero"? Seriously? I can understand a spectrum of opinions, I can understand some people think it's somewhat overvalued. But *zero*?! How any supposed "professional" could arrive at a zero valuation is beyond me.
Watch Tesla trade sideways the rest of the day
Shit I thought Tesla was making a comeback but it‚Äôs only cum on my back.
It‚Äôs people like you I love so I can keep affording to buy Tesla and in 7-10 years retire early. The people who think Tesla is a car company lol. Rather the car is a no pun ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù for Musk to test and develop advanced AI and machine learning, test battery technologies etc. Tesla is an energy harvesting and distribution company. Who will also lead the way with Self aware AI. And when Musk ties it all together‚Ä¶ underground Boring Co. on land Tesla and sky Space X , Tesla will be the nucleus for powering it all.
I think Tesla will go red, which usually means I‚Äôm wrong and it will go green, unless the market knows I‚Äôm doing reverse psychology in which case it will be red
I like how every few comments someone is trying to pump Tesla in here as if wendy‚Äôs employees have the buying power to move the price üòÇ
My Tesla CC went from 13k loss on paper to only a 7k loss on my paper right now, diamond handing this to expiration
Tesla going to consolidate and rocket up again?
I made every right play this week for once. Sold Mango at open yesterday for a nice profitWent all in Tesla 960 and 1000cTook gainz and rolled into GME 175 and 180cand bought 100 shares. Transferred 5k to the bank Feels good to win finally
I DONT TOUCH TESLA THIS ENTIRE RUN I GET CALLS IT FALLS 6% IN 20 MINUTES HOW
I bought Tesla at $1,090 with margin. I‚Äôm a fucking dumbass
Lol I posted this elsewhere but [at the current valuation Tesla is worth more than the next 15 largest car companies *combined*](https://companiesmarketcap.com/automakers/largest-automakers-by-market-cap/). Unless you litterally believe Tesla will be the only automaker in the world in 20 years these kinds of valuations are insane on any kind of logical basis. Even as a "tech" company it's not like they're that far ahead of everybody else, just look at all the hands free "autopilot" competitors everybody is coming out with.
Buy tesla dip rn
I bought a Tesla call and lost 200$ instantly wtf
Well you win Elon. Last Tesla put I ever buy‚Ä¶.
The demand for oil in 2026 will be greater then it is today. I guarantee it. I also guarantee tesla will not earn half of all money in the motor vehicle market like their stock is priced to.
5k to 20k on Tesla this week.. if I had just held overnight it woulda been 45k.. i 400% in a day and still can't stop thinking about missed gainz f
Yes the revolutionary Tesla, a car company with four models and no confirmed dates for future releases.
Who the fuks buying TESLA at $1,100Fuk that
Betting against Tesla is like blowing up a unicorn with a bomb-Saul
Man oh man, Tesla gonna split and it‚Äôll 10x again
Sold my 10/29 1050 Tesla call for 3.5 monday after buying it at 1.48 last week. Worth 5k now. What was I thinking
Resistance to Tesla is futile
Well at least you only lost $22 on those two Tesla callsmThats not much money
Just here to watch tesla cultists call GME cultists cultists

If Tesla hits 1100 I‚Äôm definitely getting a Elon tattoo

Tesla is the most ridiculous stock ever. How it can just keep going up and up and up thousands of percent with hardly any pull backs I'll never understand.
Ok I'm not a Tesla hater but...  What?? Lol
That should be a Tesla.
After I sold my Tesla calls yesterday, they went up another 400%. Should I buy TSLA calls again...
Going to buy Model $ tesla w my profits
Watch Tesla gap up another 80 today. Shit quit making sense awhile back
A) Tesla isn't a stock. It is a religion.B) People are investing in Tesla for 2025, 2028...years down the road. Every time the P/E ratio even gets close to being as low as a 100, people will scoop up Tesla again expecting more growth.
I just need Tesla to hit 1045 again and I‚Äôll just take those profits, don‚Äôt tease me today bby I called off work
People that say Tesla is over valued, haven‚Äôt priced into their models that Tesla‚Äôs sales team‚Äôs balls drag in the floor when they walk.Checkmate Burry

these fucking robhinhooders with their fractional shares of Tesla üòÇüòÇ
Barely anyone is short Tesla anymore. Short interest was like 3% as of the end of September. It‚Äôs a mix of FOMO, meme trading, and options gamma squeezing.

Tesla bears trying as hard as they can to ruin Christmas
Severely regretting listening to the people who told me 6 months ago that Tesla stock was so overvalued at $600 and would not be worth buying into.
Tesla $1100 today
Just short Tesla if you don't believe in America
Honestly wtf is going on with the marketsHertz and Tesla partnering up for profits?Are the board literally a bunch of WSB enthusiasts?
It's so nice watching Tesla bears get Hertz
I shorted it when it exponentially jumped to 800 for the first time  sold at 600 but only with a 4x leveraged 100$ not gonne bet against Tesla longterm
Pelosi was right on Nvidia and Tesla üíÄ
Imagine if Tesla goes up another 12% tomorrow. I‚Äôd be kinda surprised if it doesn‚Äôt frankly
I still can't believe there are people who short Tesla...
And all the Tesla haters crawl back into their hidey holes until the next downswing
&gt Tesla is currently producing 2500 Model 3 per week. They are aiming to produce 5000 by the end of June and 10,000 in September.
Let's assume what your saying is true. Can Tesla build Nd deliver 100k new model 3s a day?
/r/investing is famously anti Tesla, so I came here expecting since wrong numbers in main post (check) and actual, real numbers buried somewhere down (check).
Irrational exuberance.&amp#x200BI mean you will have 100k Teslas giving people their first Tesla rides every day. Anyone who has ever driven a Tesla knows it's like having an extramarital affair with your car. Nothing in your old car will ever feel as good again without that instant acceleration. So you go to [tesla.com/model3](https://tesla.com/model3) and take the plunge.Also the guy was the Ford CEO and probably oversaw the Ford EV so this isn't exactly a vote of confidence.
Jesus christ please let me not paperhands Tesla in the morning dip.
Look, it doesn't matter that Tesla is worth more than Volkswagen, Toyota, Daimler, Ford, Honda, BMW, General Motors, Fiat, Hyundai, Nissan, Suzuki and Renault all together while only producing a tiny fraction of all motor vehicles.
Tesla bulls think it‚Äôs a software company. Tesla bears think it‚Äôs a car company. Check back in 5 years to see who was right.
Tesla 1100 is not a dream bois
Or it becomes the one thing that sets them apart from the competition and they become king of the car rentals. They YOLO‚Äôd on Tesla just like the rest of us
There's a lot to speculate on.  The rental market will have tons of people driving a tesla for the first time, it could end up creating a feedback loop that drives further sales.
Oh no no no sir. You retahrds are mistaken. Hertz made out like bandits, because tesla is going to supply free service on tbe whole fleet. Theres speculation hertz is going to integrate tesla service centers into the brick and mortars. Finally giving tesla an actual service department attached to a certified hertz used tesla lot. Fuggin brillant
I know don‚Äôt base anything off the past, but if it‚Äôs anything like last year, Tesla is about to give us a hell of a ride
It‚Äôs not proposed yet but it is supposed to be 1mil or higher I think so you‚Äôre good‚Ä¶until Tesla moons even more lol
Tesla is not a car company, it's an alcoholic beverage company.
Yes they are both shit as well, especially the last few years. I should have noted I wasn't comparing the 3. I've been enamored with Tesla since they started but im not a fanboy and I'm not impressed at all with their quality especially with the luxury pricing.
Who would have thought that back in 2017 Tesla would be booming
They absolutely tried.Zaddy musk just said feel free to look elsewhere, and there is no substitute for Tesla.
Okay so who's actually buying Tesla at these prices.
I kind of feel bad for Burry. He's actually getting BS because this price action for Tesla makes zero sense
I remember last night everyone slobbering on a mango and now they're all silent. Same thing happens to tesla tomorrow.
&gtThe quality is the biggest fault i find with tesla.LOL are you familiar with GM or Ford?
If he gets assigned then he has to sell the 300.  If he bought them years ago then it is probably 90% profit, so if he thinks Tesla will be at $2000/share in a year he can only buy back 200 of those 300 shares after he pay taxes (i.e. "pay $10k, keep 300 shares, postpone taxes" vs. "pay much much more than 10k in capital gains taxes, rebuy 200 shares"... different people have different comfort levels)
If Tesla closes above 1044 tomorrow it‚Äôs going to 1200
Can‚Äôt wait for HRTZ to declare bankruptcy again and cancel their Tesla order
$1.21 in gross margin for each Tesla share assuming they are base Model 3 and Tesla makes 30%.
I just want to know, if you rent a Tesla, do you have to bring it back with a full battery?
Tesla gonna hit $1450 eoy then stock split in January/February
It's kind of crazy, nobody at the Fed or Treasury is acknowledging there is a bubble when Tesla adds the market cap of Ford 2x in a day because of some rental car sales. Not saying this is over or it's going to crash, but it's absurd bubbly behavior.
It‚Äôs Tesla when it‚Äôs runs it RUNS. Nobody is willing to sell their shares so it goes to crazy prices
I don‚Äôt know what would possess you to ever bet against Tesla
Tesla has set pricing so there is no negotiation.
Holding my Tesla 7 shares bought at 400 for the foreseeable future üòé
Good thing I took profits at $750 and got out of Tesla before it crashed down to $600.
I mean, just a couple of obvious points would be - 1. The current CEO of Hertz is a former Ford ceo. They still choose to go with Tesla even though the mach-e is an arguable pretty decent EV2. This represents Tesla starting to take market share in the fleet operator market, a market that represents large portions of sales for companies like Ford and GM.3. Normally fleet operators buy vehicles at discounts due to the volume, greatly reducing the already slim margins that legacy OEM's have. Meanwhile Tesla are selling these vehicles at full price, thus not impacting margins, and shows how strong Tesla's position is currently in the EV space2. An order for 100k EV vehicles (from a single company) for a fleet operator whose entire current fleet is only a bit more than 400k, is a very aggressive number, and strongly signals that the EV transition is gonna happen quicker than many probably expected (coincidentally Adam Jones just raised his price target and raised his 2030 forecast for Tesla by several million cars sold per year)5. This in essence is Tesla getting paid by Hertz, to allow Hertz to advertise Tesla products. Hertz is literally running ads full of Tesla's. A 100k Tesla rentals also means that A LOT of people are gonna get hands on with a Tesla vehicles, which will only further strengthen Tesla's demandYou can also get into some more nitty gritty stuff about how this is gonna give Tesla a ton of new data that they probably wouldn't normally get since the way fleet vehicles are driven and operated differs from individually owned ones.
Honestly, this is not a shitpost. Tesla really should split again. It's literally infinite money for them
Smh you clearly don‚Äôt understand that Tesla is not just a car company ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it also a tequila and booty short company
What if I‚Äôm an executive and I bought Tesla calls months ago, and then I‚Äôm pushing for my own company‚Äôs collaboration with Tesla?There are so many loopholes the rich and powerful can play with.
If Hertz bought $20M worth of calls and then sold today for a $200M gain, would it be insider trading? Free tesla hack
Already happened on Friday night. Suspect the deal was fine on Friday and Tesla was like "crap, we don't have capacity". Let's raise prices.
Made so much money on tesla I can now buy a Benz ü§£
The quality is the biggest fault i find with tesla.
Yea haha, I lost $2,000 a couple months ago and felt gross so I didn't touch Robinhood for a while. I looked at BestBuy $120 calls because of the total tech membership and I missed out so I YOLOED Tesla and got lucky.
Cathie barely sold any Tesla. Bullish as fuck.
It is hilarious that year after year after year Tesla has proven the naysayers wrong. I myself remember laughing at Tesla bulls when Tesla hit a valuation $50B in 2014. Have been eating my hat ever since :)
Older car companies have been getting too complacent in an industry where it seemed like the only innovations left were marginal gains from engineering tweaks and how you marketed the product. Then came along Tesla with an almost insane level of focus on technological advancement and now all these older companies are finally waking up to the paradigm shift that's happening to the market.
Rolled 600k I made in gamestop into Tesla at $610. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)
Tesla, bitcoin, and Palantir. The 3 positions i am never selling.
Hertz is aiming this Tesla purchase at people not wanting to do road trips. I think it's meant for people who get it on work trips etc. who have pretty well-defined route needs, and likely won't have to charge it at all.Hertz has loads of data such as "90% of all customers drive the car for 100 miles or less" before they return it. They're just doing the math, and assuming they can point those customers to Teslas vs. ICE cars. It's easier for the customer (don't need to gas up before you come back), and good for Hertz (brand halo around renting out Teslas, plus the cost savings of maintaining EVs vs. ICEs).It's actually a really smart move on Hertz' part...though I certainly don't think it warrants the bump in TSLA validation today.
Tesla now has a valuation of more than the next 9 largest automakers combined, and that valuation surged 100B on news of a sales deal worth a few B in revenue.  People have continuously underestimated the peak but we are in crazy territory now.
1000$ is cheap for Tesla stock
Just last quarter (Q3 2021), Tesla produced 237,823 cars while delivering 241,391.They have no issue delivering 100,000 for just one customer, especially if they are paying full price.
The cult never stops trying, even after convincing people to sell Tesla for their scam.
So does anyone know how exactly hertz is spending $4 billion on Tesla cars? Aren‚Äôt they bankrupt?
i missed out on tesla so i bought revenge puts. literally cant go tits up
&gt Remove GM and Ford's debt and give them a 50% CAGR for the foreseeable future, their valuation would be sky high too.That would help, but they don't have Tesla's gross margins.If their debt went away tomorrow, they'd have to go heavily back into debt to try to catch up to Tesla on tech/features in 5-10 years.  This is like Border's Books trying to catch up to Amazon (hint: they died in 2011).
Some dumbass still buying Tesla puts.
The general opinion on Tesla in /r/investing has always had a negative bent. When the stock price was lower a few years back, people were all, "I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole. They could go bankrupt any day now". Now that it's flying high alongside Amazon &amp Apple, "Well, it could come back down to Earth tomorrow."They're like the permabears who post about the next market crash that's just around the corner every year. Maybe it's time for those people reevaluate their outlooks.
Tesla was one of those stocks I always looked at but never fucked with. Today I finally bought calls at 1pm and Elon musk have seen my order and smiled upon.
No, they went bankrupt after Nio took over Tesla as the largest car company in the world
Remember to [sell Tesla at the top](https://twitter.com/squawksquare/status/1450107483889053702?s=21)
Somebody explain to me how they got this money? Did they buy tesla calls prior?
Rental cars don't get treated well, and Tesla has never been quick with replacement parts.  I sure hope Hertz' deal has guarantees for parts availability.  Otherwise I foresee a lot of downtime for those vehicles.
You think everyone who thinks Tesla is overpriced is a Tesla hater?
Tesla just recalled almost 300k cars in China...
Most of the longs are actual longs. Many of us have held for years and years. I remember Tesla did nothing for almost 5 years.
Tesla bears are gay losers.
It would be insane if we woke up with spy at 460 and tesla at 1150.
Worth much more than that. These cars will be replaced. They will order more. And it's free advertising and acquisition for Tesla.
Their 25% stake today would be worth almost as much as Toyota itself.Mercedes sold their 9% stake of Tesla too, which at today‚Äôs value would worth 20% *more* than what Mercedes is worth itself.Truly wild.
&gt I think Tesla will be at $325.00 by the end of the week.
Wonder if the owners of new *Hertz* have any Tesla positions. I mean not really.
Here I am once again watching Tesla soar to newer highs and missing the gains üôÇ
Have you done the math on all of their competitors? They will sell millions too. Tesla has... 13% EV market share I think? It's expected to be flat or decline. You think it's a 10 trillion dollar industry?
You had the balls I never had on Tesla. Congrats.
I‚Äôll use your bets against Tesla to buy my next lambo üêí
It works until it doesn't. I'm not naysaying, I like Tesla. It just literally is outside of any fundamentals. You can't blame people for not understanding. If it ever does crater don't be mad at the same people that are just saying "I don't understand the valuation".
it‚Äôs still a lil undervalued. Tesla 1500 eoy
Look I'm the biggest bear here but I think Tesla is 1500 by eow.
Because their debt is so fucking high. GM has $89B in net debt while Ford is $123B. Almost all of their operating cash flow goes to paying debt.Tesla could pay off their debt tomorrow and this year, the operation cash flow is only a few billion less than GM/Ford.Remove GM and Ford's debt and give them a 50% CAGR for the foreseeable future, their valuation would be sky high too.
BEARS ARE FUCKED. TESLA 1300 EOD TOMORROW üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Tesla, not Ford
I bought puts on Friday right before close. I thought there would be a mini drop that I could cash in on‚Ä¶ and then I woke up to Tesla opening at 960 lol. Rekt me

&gt Hertz did their deligience that not only Tesla is a huge draw, but the total cost of ownership is lower than all the legacy EV.Yeah you're gonna have to explain that one bud. Rental car companies routinely sell their cars after  2-3 years, so even  with gas, the biggest maintenance cost is literally oil changes. You can try and point at the supercharger network or whatever, but  seeing that the rest of the car industry and government is investing in a standardized plug, it's a losing game long term, at least I think so.
First the elongated muskrat will split the stock 5 ways again and it'll race up to $1000.  Tesla will have a $5 trillion dollar market valuation and Elon is the first trillionaire with his 23% stake.
I‚Äôve made so much money from Tesla stock. It‚Äôs hilarious seeing all the naysayers in this sub who think they‚Äôre so smart for not owning Tesla. Well have fun missing out on the easiest gains of your lives!
Have you done the math on how many cars tesla needs to sell to justify its valuation ?
8 examples of the largest market cap tech companies, like tesla
The total order is worth north of $5B, but yeah, even Elon himself agrees with you:&gtEven Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. "Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem," Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.
It‚Äôs up to 1000 nowWait that‚Äôs Tesla, ur fucked

Now I can jack off in a Tesla and not have to clean it. Thank you Hertz. Always looking out for degenerates like me
It's amusing that this is about the first time I've seen Tesla stock rise in a rational fashion based on the news. They've commited to selling ~10% of their total car making capacity for a 12% stock bump.lol trillion dollar company's up to making about a million cars a year now.
can‚Äôt laugh at burry, he‚Äôs a rich retard with money to burn. I‚Äôm laughing at all the poor retards who thought they were geniuses shorting Tesla LOL.
&gtVery few people who drive a Model 3 will think about buying Camry as their next car.Absolutely. A test drive in one of the good EVs is definitely one of those "oh the future is actually already here" moment.&gt Competition is not coming, unless you think you know more about car business than Mark Fields.Tbf it's more like competition isn't coming for mass rental fleet EVs. For private ownership a lot of the competitors are doing quite well actually. But as the overall EV market is growing quickly, competitors doing well doesn't mean Tesla will lose sales. They are all just eating into the large existing ICE vehicle market.
gme needs to announce tesla superchargers in the store. I should be the ceo
Killing myself cause the 100 dollars I put into Tesla 1000 calls last week would now have been 8k, instead I sold for 300 and am still broke as shit
Holly fuck that‚Äôs a huge lose.  How does one who bet against Tesla have that kinda of money ?
The fact that Hertz CEO, Mark Fields (former Ford CEO), chose to pay full price and willing to wait 14 months for Tesla speak volumes.Hertz could easily split the order to like 50k Tesla, 25K Mach E and 25k ID4. They could get huge discounts but chose not to buy from Ford, VW or GM. Hertz did their deligience that not only Tesla is a huge draw, but the total cost of ownership is lower than all the legacy EV.But at the same time, if any customer renting a Mach E is stuck in the middle of nowhere because Electrify America chargers broke down, they would not rent from Hertz again. Tesla's supercharger network is a huge moat and any other rental companies buying non-Tesla EV will have to face.While Tesla is supply constrained for years to come, putting many more drivers who get to drive Tesla for the first time will just light the fire on more demands for Model 3, Y and Cybertruck. Very few people who drive a Model 3 will think about buying Camry as their next car.TLDR. Competition is not coming, unless you think you know more about car business than Mark Fields.
Did Rivian not help Ford with its electric trucks, they are ugly but not nearly as ugly as the Tesla truck and look semi land rover like. They should sell well
I am hearing Lot of big investors and hedge funds got crushed today trying to short Tesla it is beautiful.
They spent 25% of their market value on a Tesla fleet. Wow, I‚Äôm speechless.
Nothing like losing money while tesla players get 4000% gain

How do you have 900K$ to lose on tesla weekly options?

I actually want to cry right now, sold my Tesla calls for $2700 this morning worth almost $10k now FUCKKKKKKKKK I‚Äôm having trouble digesting this one
Imagine everything that people do in and with a rental car, then imagine them doing it in a Tesla.Rental Car fleets are a nightmare to manage in good times, I can't imagine how bad this will be.  Now add the added dynamic of very limited range, and people who have no idea how to charge them properly, or late for a flight that stop charging at just enough to get them to the airport.I know Hertz will try to keep them in the "Premium Fleet", but in the real world, when that President's Circle member is screaming at the shift Supervisor that he MUST be at XYZ in an hour, and the flight is already late,  he doesn't give a damn that they are out of cars, sees those Tesla's sitting on the back row, I know what happens next. Then all of the people behind him waiting for cars start bitching.Ask me how I know all of this?This may work in places like Laguardia, Bos, or DCA with very short distances but it won't at Chicago, when the guy has to be in Peoria in two hours. And yes, people really do schedule like that, always have... Ask yourself why car rental companies don't have huge fleets of Nissan Leaf's.
So annoyed I suck at Tesla. I love Tesla. I own a Tesla. But I don't really mess with its stock or options. Why was I born this way

I quit my job and today is my first day ‚Äúself employed‚Äù and Tesla made me 3 months worth of income in a day. Zamn
Wish me luck i just shorted TESLA
He's going to allow tesla owners to rent out their cars with uber while they're not using it.
I remember I got Tesla back when it peaked around 190$ and it started dropping so I freaked out and sold... I didn't know how to invest back then. Very sad
Struggling with Tesla fomo right now. Congrats fuckers
Tesla 1050 EOD?
The best part is that once Tesla started breaking out, Burry tried to save himself by saying it was a tiny short play and the media overplayed it‚Ä¶.but he gladly rode the spotlight when Tesla wasn‚Äôt movingü§°
Never bet againt Tesla and Elon. You will lose.
My avg price for Tesla $780.  Ahhahahahah thought it‚Äôd never go up.   G bless!!!!
Tesla gonna be 1600 by friday just watch
Fuck this I always miss Tesla
Tesla had an allergic reaction to 1040 apparently
I‚Äôm holding my Tesla $1200 calls overnight
The people selling Tesla right now are dorks
Tesla is literally pulling the entire nasdaq lmfao
Tesla fomo hitting hard but I know if I buy in I will ruin it for everyone here
in fairness, Tesla was about a month away from going bankrupt just like the rumors suggested and Elon even later admitted it.  he also was being a complete moron at the time (more than normal) because he knew they could very well go under.
Bought Tesla calls for 5.10, sold for 3.85, now at 9.05 ü§°
I said it on Friday when dwac clowns were here and I‚Äôll say it again, Tesla is the original meme stock
What is Tesla doing. Did it forget about the gravity lol
Tesla up 10% in a day is reminiscent of summer 2020. Amazing times and amazing gainsEnjoy it guys
Today alone, Tesla went up three Ford‚Äôs in market cap. Ford has three times the revenue of Tesla. Fucking crazy land.
Some Tesla bear salty asf in here üòπüòπüòπ
who‚Äôs buying a supra with their tesla gains today?
Tesla isn't going to the moon. It is the moon.
imagine missing this whole tesla run
I was going to fomo into Tesla options but figured I‚Äôd do the opposite since I‚Äôm always wrong. Well I was wrong about being wrong.
Congrats to all you new Tesla millionaires. My hat is off to you.
Officially convinced selling my Tesla shares before the split was not the best decision
I am speechless with this tesla run.
WTF HOW IS TESLA STILL SHOWING NO SIGN OF SLOWING DOWN
Let‚Äôs have a moment of silence for anyone who was between playing DWAC or Tesla today and chose DWAC‚Ä¶
Shit, If I knew dingle nuts was gonna "get a media empire going" a couple weeks ago and I had spare tendies to invest...I woulda dumped 10g right into that without thinking.Soon as it went way up of course I'd dump that turd like a bad roast beef sandwich at arby's knowing that the crash of that thing will be worse than a 20 car pile up at Daytona.Grab the cash from the boomer tards who will be thinking it's gonna be "conservative disney" and smoke some avacado cigarettes in your tesla roadster.Or cybertruck, ya know, no judgement.
My biggest regret is not putting myself into crippling debt the day Tesla started trading buying and holding. God damn, just thinking about it makes me hard and sad at the same time.
I‚Äôm still on the fence like how the hell is Tesla worth more than Toyota or Volkswagen.  I get the future upside potential but honestly if any major car company would step up their electric game Tesla would be in trouble.
I remember when Tesla was $50 dollars. What a time to be alive. Congrats.
DUSTING OFF MY TESLA 1000 HAT AGAIN üöÄüöÄ
If I can put money in to a bank account at 5% and zero risk instead of 0%, then there is less demand for buying over priced Tesla stock. Rising interest rates also mean bond rates go up, meaning you can also put money in to bonds rather than stock. The relationship between interest rates and stocks is pretty fundamental to finance.
At this point anything under $750-800 is a steal‚Ä¶ CW GOT THIS ONE RIGHT. I‚Äôve been investing in Tesla for about 2 years now.
Shorts piling into Tesla will only juice the uptrend
Tesla is literally carrying SPY right now.
Tesla priced in for the next 87 years Just in time for when the machines make a uprising
Just bought some really stupid Tesla calls 2 hours ago. Somehow, I'm up 30% already. Wtf
Tesla is priced in for the next 50 years lmfao.
Imagine getting your DickWACked instead of buying tesla calls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)
Tesla going parabolic lmfao Burry is a jackass
Who else is up 300% on Tesla fds and buying more?!
Am I the only one who didn‚Äôt Yolo Tesla today?
Remember guys Tesla stonk only goes up
ouch down 50% on my tesla puts but imma keep adding üòÇ
Im a Tesla bear to the core.  I bought shares last week.  Cant beat them, join them.
Why is there volume on tesla $1800 c. What kind of retard is buying that shit. Definitely from wsb.üíÄ
‚ÄúWow bro Tesla a meme‚Äù ‚ùå‚ÄúWow bro the entire American economy a meme‚Äù ‚úÖ
###AMD IS THE POOR MANS TESLA
Tesla power hour is gonna be wild.
Im so dumb for selling my tesla weeklies at open NEVER TAKE PROFITS even if I was up 500%
ùóïùó•ùóòùóîùóûùóúùó°ùóö: at the $996.50 intraday high, Tesla just crossed the 1 trillion dollars market cap for the first time in its history!
Michael Burry punching the air today, Tesla keeps raw dogging his ass üòÇ
Why are y‚Äôall buying puts in Tesla? Have you learned nothing the past 5 years?
Tesla calls printing. I don‚Äôt own any but I imagine they are printing.
Tesla is what every other meme aspires to be.
Tesla gains 80 billion market cap on news of a sale worth between 5 and 10 billion.Makes sense.
Turned $2100 into 78k off my 10/29 970c TSLA and sold them Thanks Tesla, have a good rest of your day WSB üôèüèº good luck
Took Apple 40 years to breach $1 Trillion market cap.Took Tesla only 16 years. Apple basically a trash company.
Guys think about it. Hertz is buying 100k tesla vehicles. That's already 6 billion in sales. If you're not in tesla now you're fucking your future self over
DUSTING OFF MY TESLA 1000 HAT AGAIN
Just bought into Tesla, hope I picked a good entry point ü§°
Just shorted Tesla at $995.5. God have mercy on my soul
I'm the guy who sold his 11/19 tesla calls Friday for a $20 gain... ü§°
I‚Äôm a Tesla bull but this was hilarious
Two biggest investing mistakes in my life:  selling my Tesla shares in 2017 because I just didn‚Äôt see the value (and thought Elon was a complete moron), and buying CLOV in the first place.
Since Hertz ordered 100K of Tesla model 3, I can see enterprise probably going to put in their order soon.Too much tendies coming from daddy Elon
this dude is so clueless he said lambo and not tesla
When Tesla was around 780 early Oct or late Sept
Innit I decided a long time ago that Tesla is dead to me. I can‚Äôt bring myself to buy it, and I know I can‚Äôt short it, so I‚Äôm just going to stay away and make plays that I feel comfortable with.
The other cults you compared it to have actual products. Apple has phones. AMD has Chips. Tesla has cars. You think it‚Äôs that easy to create an enterprise social media website that can handle that much throughput by just splashing money? Please
20,000 open interest for Tesla 1000c fds.We definitely hitting 1100 by Friday
ya, don't short tesla, come on bro.
Lol. Ok, yes, please go short tesla more with smart statements like &gtThey are selling each car at a loss. They get profits from carbon creditsI get the feeling you didn't even read the last earnings report. The percentage of total profit that comes from carbon credit has been dropping every year and in the most recent year, the profit from the credits has only been ~280M. Tesla had &gt1B in profit from sources such as cars/energy sales.
I lost 200k on Tesla overnight the one time they reported in 2019 and failed expectations by A LOT. Literally any other earnings after that and I would've 4-5x'd my money. At one point I had 800 Tesla presplit shares. Just fuck my life
Ya honestly impressive how much Tesla has run and how I‚Äôve managed to time it poorly every single time and haven‚Äôt made money off it lol I‚Äôm bad at this guys
Just transferred 50k of profit to my bank, thanks Tesla Also loaded up on some 11/5 1000c, Tesla my baby is ripping through 1000 by the end of this week üòÅ
So how thenfuck did this monkey make cash out of puts today. Have you seen tesla stock. Bears are buying rope
I put my life savings into Tesla calls
Friend of mine bought in Tesla with $4,500 it‚Äôs now worth $105,000+
Tesla roadster or Lamborghini is an honest question
Never.Bet.Against.A.CultLove the car, the company is solid and not going anywhere. Is it valued correctly, absolutely not! Am I putting money on it dropping? No freaking way! This stock has killed so many famous investors because they all don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre up against a cult, and a cult don‚Äôt care about fundamentals. If you‚Äôre a Tesla bear, just stay out of the way. You‚Äôll save a lot of money.
getting $5000 worth of tesla at the same time this guy bought it would‚Äôve been a BIG come up for a guy like me whew
Nah, Tesla moved me from a modest \~32k to \~540k as of this morning. That 32k was my life savings in the form of Roth and Traditional IRA.
Thanks for the $$$. I‚Äôm up 1800% ROI largely due to tesla :)
If TSLA closes above 980 I beat my meatIf it closes below 970 I beat my childChoose wisely, Tim Tesla
Who needs a lambo when you can buy a tesla model s plaid for a fraction of the cost of a new Lamborghini.
I tried shorting it with puts once. Since then I‚Äôve made that profit back with calls üòÇI‚Äôve learned‚Ä¶ not necessarily with Tesla but other stocks that it doesn‚Äôt really matter what something is worth. It Matters what enough people value it at
It‚Äôs all good. Just get yourself a Tesla and you‚Äôll understand why this stock only goes up.
Pulled up next to a Lambo last week in my wife‚Äôs model x. I pointed forward (can‚Äôt rev it). He shook his head and slowed down. Can‚Äôt beat the Tesla!
Bitch why would I drive a Lambo when I own a Tesla?
I remember buying Tesla at 675 and wondering if I was actually retarded. I wish I wasn't such a pussy and put that money into a debit spread instead of my single share.
#TESLA GANG ESCORT NIGHT
Holy fucking Tesla this morning.
Just made 4k on Tesla 1050c fds in an hr, not bad
For a car company, Tesla  really starting to act like a space company üöÄ
My Tesla puts just melted lol
Imagine some broke ass Tesla short convulsing in his moms basement right now
Tesla trading like it‚Äôs a small cap. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
&gtwho the hell buys a vehicle in its absolute most basic configuration?Many Tesla buyers actually. You see, unlike most other cars, Teslas have no options apart from paint, seat colours, wheels, and FSD. All the equipment is included, from parking cameras to heated seats, and from autopilot to a full panoramic sunroof. You've just proved the previous commenter's point right - you really don't know anything about Teslas.
The more Tesla flies‚Ä¶ the more people are willing to put those profits in buying a Tesla. Infinite money glitch for Elon.
Let the Tesla FOMO begin
Good fucking God TESLA!!!!!!
So glad to have held these Tesla calls over the weekend
Remember when it was insane that Tesla hit $1000, and then it split to 1/5 of the price and is about to do it again...all my friends told me to buy at around $350 pre-split. They all made 10-20x üòë
toyota: chip maker for 2021 i want 30% less chipsTesla: chip maker for 2021 i want 40% more chips2021 comes....toyota: chip maker now i want more chips! demand came fastchip maker: sorry i cant produce more -30% it istesla: how are my +40% doing?chip maker: sorry, cant produce that much, only +30% is securedtesla: fine, ill buy chips from others and rewrite software to reach +40%
hertz is going to buy $3 bil of Tesla‚Äôs when they have a market cap of $1.2 bil.Tesla is selling 100,000 cars to hertz, when they claimed they will have 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Something stinks
Wow...100k cars cost just $4.2 bilion. Even with a margin of 10% profit per car which is crazy unreal for tesla, that would bring $420 milion in profits. Company valued at close to 1 trilion...buy up plebs ü§¶
1 Tesla share üôÇ
And in 7-10 years Tesla will be able to make that many cars.
More like a few more people today became aware of the paradigm shift Tesla is causing.
4.2BILLION DOLLARS INTO TESLA"S GODDAM POCKET, HOLY FUCKING SHIT MAN TESLA IS MAKING BANK
I bought $1000 tesla calls on Friday and I just knew it was gone be a good idea
holyfuck Hertz is buying 100k Tesla Model 3s[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-surges-toward-a-record-after-hertz-reportedly-ordered-100000-tesla-evs-2021-10-25](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-surges-toward-a-record-after-hertz-reportedly-ordered-100000-tesla-evs-2021-10-25)
Holy shit TESLA!
The fomo on Tesla is hilarious
TESLA 1000 is the Floor Or whatever you degenerates say
Hertz Global Holdings Inc., barely four months out of bankruptcy, placed an order for 100,000 Teslas in the first step of an ambitious plan to electrify its rental-car fleet, according to people with knowledge of the matter, Bloomberg News reports.It‚Äôs the single-largest purchase ever for electric vehicles and represents about $4.2 billion of revenue for¬†Tesla Inc., according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. While car-rental companies typically demand big discounts from automakers, the size of the order implies that Hertz is paying close to list prices.¬†The cars will be delivered over the next 14 months, and Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 sedans will be available to rent at Hertz locations in major U.S. markets and parts of Europe starting in early November, the people said. Customers will have access to Tesla‚Äôs network of superchargers, and Hertz is also building its own charging infrastructure, they said.¬†The electrification plan, which eventually will encompass almost all of Hertz‚Äôs half-million cars and trucks worldwide, is the company‚Äôs first big initiative since emerging from bankruptcy in June. And it signals that Hertz‚Äôs new owners,¬†Knighthead Capital Management¬†and¬†Certares Management, are intent on shaking up an industry dominated by a handful of large players who are typically slow to change.
Tesla bears, tell me where it hertz.
Found the guy with Tesla puts
Holy fuck Tesla might pull a 2020 and moon shot everyday
Ark never moves up though. Tesla does
Well, rip to anyone with Tesla puts.
~~ITS LIKE 2020 AGAIN!~~ TESLA to $1000 EOD
BROOO HERTZ BUYING 100,000 Teslas WTF IS GOING ONTesla gonna nut today
Seriously, this pissed me off. Tesla is not a new company anymore, how do people still not know the basics of how much a car costs.
Tesla just opened 2 new gigas starting production end of this year/beginning of next, and they've always found a way to work around the shortages and have also said it should get better next year. Once supply Reaches demand, it's going straight up. Don't miss out.
Kinda glad I bought 910calls on Tesla on Friday
&gt When the loan is priced at 9%, how many are going to be sold?Seeing as how they already have up to 11 months on backorder AND there's an $8000 EV tax credit in the works... still easily every car Tesla makes. It'll affect other automakers though.
Let‚Äôs not forget Tesla took a week to break 800 and smashed through 900 (all time highs). Big boys are starting to buy in
Tesla to hit 1k by the end of the week at this pace! Calls at the open
Tesla mooning. My 1000 banbet gonna work all of you bitches eat shit who bought put. Live in foodstamp and momma basement, go to wendies suck some dicks then lick old man cramers balls. He pump tesla to 1000 all you put buying burry fan assfucks fuck you and your momma pussy
Because its not nearly as simple as you are making it out to be. You bought into a good company that's growing, and you are seeing gains. But what happens if tesla batteries start catching on fire, or Elon does something stupid? Then what happens a few years from now when TSLA starts to plateau, and your gains even out too, then you have to figure out the next company to roll that money into? You bought Tesla with zero research (by your own admission), how will you know what your next investment should be? &amp#x200BYou are coming off as pretty arrogant if I'm being honest. You say "for you, its as simple as buying low and selling high" but then you go on to say you don't even know how to determine when its "the low" and "the high". Right now, TSLA is making you money, so it seems like an amazing decision to buy. And it probably will be, but there's no guarantee of that. &amp#x200BNow that I'm done beating you up...  Do some reading around here, and online. TD Ameritrade has really great educational resources on thinks like Fundamental and even Technical analysis, options courses, market mechanics, etc. Start with those. At the very least, you will learn the general market terms, and probably some surface level analysis that you can build off of.
This is where I buy Tesla calls right?
Tesla bears get sooooooo butt hurt about Elon because they‚Äôre usually the #iamverysmart ‚Äúsmart guys‚Äù who are utterly impressionable. The market disproves their fantasy and they claim it‚Äôs all just noise and hype, and direct their hatred at the worlds most successful person, calling him a fraud.It truly is a wonder to behold
N FAAGUTNetflix, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, Upstart, Tesla!!
I know a guy who has a avg price of $200-300 on Tesla. Dude still will not sell. This fucking guy
I've never heard of MAGA hating Tesla until you just mentioned it nor is it a "thing" of any significance in any conservative circles I've seen. On the contrary, conservatives seem quite fond of Musk.
Tesla has a product though
This is wrong on a lot of counts. A lot of MAGA folks love them some Elon and Tesla.
Funny enough, I belong to that Tesla cult. One of my top 5 greatest regrets in life was letting a financial advisor talk me out of investing $50k in Feb of 2020.
I‚Äôm as Conservative as they get. I drive a Tesla. Has nothing to do with the environment. It‚Äôs convenient, goes really fast, turns heads.
Omg its even worse than it looks at first glance - he's net short on tesla betting on 250 strike@!!  and net neutral on GME with short calls betting on 50 strike (someone tell this guy there's no theta that far itm!?)Dude the reason you're account isn't changing is because you're short as much as you're long!!
Not retirement related, but Tesla has been sued for doing exactly that.  They offered early manufacturing employees the option to buy stock at below market value, vesting at 25% per year of employment.  Of course they also had below market wages, but said the stock option made up for it.  In 2017 they were sued by a former employee who was fired one DAY before his first year of employment.  With Tesla's stock price increases, that cost him over $200k.  The case went down to arguing what time of day he was hired and fired.
Why is owning a Tesla so ‚Äúanti-MAGA‚Äù to you? Tesla is non-union and Biden seems to really be favoring every other car company.
So you‚Äôre sort gme and Tesla calls?Close the short calls hold the 23 call. Gme will go up before the end of the year.
Rocket is about to take off. Having both Tesla and Lucid calls for Jan 22. See you at Moon fellow retards. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
For anyone sat on the fence, I thought I‚Äôd crunch some numbers.Just had a quick Google to find some approximate production numbers per year.Daimler make 2.8 million, BMW make 2million, Renault make 2.2 million and VAG make 10 millionSo from just those 4 groups they make 17 million per year.If they all have 2 LIDAR units per car that‚Äôs 34 million unitsIf it‚Äôs $500 profit per unit that‚Äôs $17 billion profit per year!Based on 15x profit that would give a market cap of $255billion which would be $1,625 per share. Now bear in mind that valuation is just based on those 4 groups, and doesn‚Äôt include Ford, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover, Peugeot, Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan, Honda, Vauxhall, Volvo, Kia, Aston Martin, Mitsubishi, Lexus, Citreon, Mazda plus Tesla and any other brands that exist that I haven‚Äôt listed! And it doesn‚Äôt include any value for the AR vertical or the Sharp Foxconn contract or consumer LIDAR or the interactive display tech. Mind blown.
Yeah I think this is an interesting point. I'm quite contrarian in that I dislike companies such as tesla and amazon for reasons like fundamentals and/or culture. So I actively pick stocks and avoid such companies, and I've been doing pretty okay
I don‚Äôt think Tesla is quite done
He hates Tesla so much it‚Äôs actually quite cringe seeing it on CNBC every other week
ARK is underperforming..  Tesla is over performing.. as is tradition..
He didn't found Tesla. Tesla hired him as CEO to do PR for the company and raise the stock price. Which he did, but that doesn't make him some amazing genius who is steering humanity to the next technological age.
Hindsight has very little value. Buying 10k in BTC 5 years ago would have been a risky move. *Now* we know that it would have been successful but with the information that was available then, was it a wise investment? I would say no. This is not me bashing crypto (that's a debate that everyone has had and heard way too many times already),  I would say the same about buying 10k worth of say TESLA before it boomed or anything like that (unless you are rich enough that 10k was a minor side investment for you, perhaps). You can make risky investments and win big. But most of the people who make risky investments  *lose* big - that's what "risky" means, after all - and generally the utility functions of most people are concave, at least for big enough amounts: losing 80% of your savings would damage you a lot more than making an 80% profit on it would benefit you. So the wiser move, I think, is not to make risky investments at all and accept the fact that some people *will* make risky investments and make money a lot faster than you - that's what happens if you take risks and get lucky, and if enough people make risky investments some are *bound* to get lucky.
Lol okay dude. At some point you have to realize you just sound ridiculous downplaying everything. Again, I don't even like the guy at all. But SpaceX is worth $50-100B. Wtf is a big company?I agree Tesla is way overrated and overvalued. But it's still done some impressive stuff.PayPal definitely was a tech company as it started, more of just financial services now, I guess, but they're still fintech. Own Venmo and whatnot. Idk what your point even is, though, lol.
I don't like Musk because he is definitely a narcissistic douchebag and has a lot of terrible qualities. But his technology knowledge seems pretty damn strong. Founding or being an early part of 3 major tech\* (PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla) companies and an early, relatively innovative dotcom company is pretty impressive.
my 10 year old plays roblox everyday and  I've spent 1 hr on it and can say with 100% certainty that roblox is not the tesla of social media.
Agreed.  If Tesla gets the reputation of being not as safe as other cars, even it's a small margin, they won't sell.
Good luck with that.  Tesla stock is at least 3 times higher than it should be.  I like what they are doing but it is hugely overpriced.
Tesla 900cs at open Thursday were 20 baggers.. happens all the time
So is tesla worth like 1t iyo?
musk will fail, he will need lidar they're investigating him now no? his camera system is a sick joke costing lives. he's the top 'autonomous' or 'electric' brand right, but just cause hes first to market doesnt mean he'll win, once these europeon car makers adapt ADAS it's over for musk imo. i'd be on the short side of tesla imo
tesla will be at 2k a share in a couple years if not sooner
Tell this to my in laws. They‚Äôre mid 70s, building a $1.2M house and are about to buy a Tesla.
He would have to come up with the other ~34k to buy 100 shares. That‚Äôs the benefit of the LEAP. Same capital gains with less money in the play. There is probably very little time premium this deep in the money anyway. If he thinks it‚Äôll keep going up hold if he thinks this is it for Tesla, sell.
I bought Tesla around the same time and found both companies to be in a similar situation. Share price was depressed and there was a lot of shit talk happening about the companies but as far as I could see both seemed like excellent ideas that would ultimately be successful. I couldn't understand all the hate. Still don't.But no, I did not expect either of them to get so big.
Lmao didn‚Äôt think I would see a Tesla loss, it‚Äôs been green for weeks
If we knew the answer to that shit do you think we'd be browsing, daydreaming and chatting it up with a buncha normies on fucking REDDIT??!?!  Yea, you're guaranteed 400 percent gains on a any Tesla yolo.  It is known.
Trump, Tesla, GMEAll in on cult stonks
I honestly don‚Äôt think the cybertruck will destroy the truck market, it‚Äôs just too extreme for a lot of people (I still have a reservation for one, but I‚Äôm just a regular suburban dude, not a rancher, farmer, construction worker, etc).  I would foresee a second, more traditional looking truck coming out from Tesla eventually. I can‚Äôt imagine that monstrous thing being as commonplace on roads as an F-150 or Silverado.
Never sell the Tesla stonks!
Yeah but can you trim your hedges with that money? No. But my tesla robot will be trimming my hedges. 100% of my portfolio is and will continue to be TSLA until they open up the order page. Everyone who sold in the meantime will gawk as my robot slave brings me grapes.
Tesla to 1000$ soon
I sold Tesla today at 905. I'm happy with it, made some money.
Stay long enough and you'll eventually stumble your way into a gold one. I missed GME, every SPAC before this, Tesla, and every other meme stock.
Tesla has already mooned.Stock going to Pluto?Source: scarred tesla bear
Did you just compare DWAC to tesla??? Lol how do you not realize that these are two of the most different cimpanies that can possibly be?Tesla developed electric vehicles that actually work on scale, and a charging infrastructure in a world that desperately needs to get away from wastefully burning oil.  Lead by a previously successful in every endeavor taken on by Elon.DWAC is an almost bankrupt SPAC, with 25k cash on hand and lost over 700 million in the last two quarters, which sells or develops NO products.  with the worlds largest conman who has bankrupted every company he has been a part of just signing on..... less than 200k volume and price rose by 35 dollars in one day, this is the biggest sign of artificial inflation ive seen in my whole career.  But, do you, i dont really care if trumpers lose their money to their lord and savior.
The $900 ceiling on Tesla is wild
Bruh I had tesla at 370 but like a retard I kept selling and buying too make 2-3% each time.. Made 30% total...
TSLA is holding until I retire in the 2040's. Tesla will be a giant slab of stainless steel in my driveway in \~2023.
Sector rotation into Tesla. Tesla ATH tomorrow because europoors gonna FOMO.
No. A fundamental part of my thesis is that Tesla vehicles are years ahead of competition in features, technology, battery efficiency, pricing, and self driving capabilities.  I don‚Äôt see a viable competitor for many years maybe ever.
Same with Tesla. Smart people bought 70k of tesla stock not a 70k tesla.
Maybe they were waiting on some Tesla calls to print
Tesla is gonna moon. $1000 before year end
I hate that I sold all my "hype" stocks like Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, and Disney because I wanted to be a smart and responsible "value investor." I learned that my portfolio beta was like 15. Brought it down to 0.70. I learned about P/E ratios and decided to only buy stocks that have lower P/E ratios than the S&ampP. I learned about free cash flow and went with companies whose FCF was growing and capable of paying off dividends or debt. I learned about Benjamin Graham and wanted to be like him. I learned about the "dangers" of meme stocks and tried to stay away from them. I thought I was finally getting the hang of this.Currently going sideways for the past 2 years when I would have 100x'd my money if I didn't sell my hype stocks.
Tesla does not depend on Apple üçé, it‚Äôll be fine.
So many Bernie boys about to lose the house anger shorting this. This is Tesla and boomers all over again
Never bet against Tesla. You will lose all the time
At first I was like who tf buys $100 puts on Tesla, but then I saw the $50 put, and I was immediately enlightened.
It's not really about the growth in the end - it's about risk adjusted opportunity. At 200 PE, the company is more susceptible to re-rating (the kind that derails your portfolio) if the company grows slower than expected or has bad execution. But Tesla is a great example of stocks defying gravity. It's numbers have mad 0 sense for 10 years. The company has had a great operational 2-3 years where the story is actually playing out. But it's still unbelievably overvalued and disconnected from realistic projections. So if you want to own snap using the information we have, my assessment is your risk adjusted returns are not as good as they could be with something more fundamentally sound. And given that, snap stock price could remain disconnected from fundamentals for a very long time and ene up being a GREAT investment for 1, 3, 5, 15 years.
In my view the biggest option mispricing wrt to Tesla is in the long term, which I why my plays are long term oriented.
Well if Tesla doubles my portfolio will more than double. I can see that happening in next 2-3 years with ramp up of giga Berlin and Austin, and rollout of FSD. No plans to sell. Holding long term.
Maybe someone trying to hedge their bet on Tesla? If I had a few million in Tesla maybe it's worth having some insurance if it's found out that Tesla uses the blood of children to power their factories?
I had my best friend telling me to sell every 10 mins. Fucker held 10k in tesla at 250 all the way to 100k. Fuck him lmao.
Remember that guy that turned $400 into 8m on Tesla leaps?  There was some retard on the other side of that trade.
Yeah, but it's also the equivalent of throwing thousands of dollars on a burning Tesla.
Most underpriced stock on the exchange.  Long Tesla is literally free money.*Not financial advice
My wife works at a collision repair facility and I‚Äôm an electrician. We will never own a Tesla anything ever.Edit : Except for shares of course
Trash automod banned me even though tesla got to exactly 900 lmao. Thank fuck for human modsüòÇ
It‚Äôs a FD. Even if Tesla drops only a bit those cheap puts go up in value. But Tesla is so volatile so it needs to happen fast
Tesla doesn't need to hit the strike for OP to profit, but it needs to drop very fast, very soon. Of course that's assuming he'd take his gains, which is clearly not a possibility considering how retarded this ~~bet~~ donation is.
you know what would have been a smarter move than this ? Literally nothing, just letting your money sit for a lil while. Guy literally waited for Tesla to reach ATH's again, then bought in
Master stroke. Yeah seriously all you have to do is buy and hold Tesla. It‚Äôs crazy.
Am I reading his right? You thought Tesla would dip to 50 dollars by December? Wtf?
Never short Tesla.  And those strike prices?  What is the hell were you thinking?  Tesla's are literally everywhere and you somehow think the company is just going to crash and burn to below $100?  I'm truly astonished by your retardation.
given tesla's battery / energy research and all that, it's likely even nuclear exchange between china and russia would tank tesla to 50.  ...i need to start selling options
I didn‚Äôt even buy the MAGA stock, but I just wanna see it rip for entertainment. fuck it, let‚Äôs beat Tesla to $1000
My dad had some tesla. He ended up dumping it.  3 months later the split happened. Why do people keep betting against that mad man? Hes been succesful at everything hes touched since he was litteraly a middleschooler.
50 puts aren‚Äôt just betting against Tesla, that‚Äôs predicting Elons death and a worldwide ban of electric cars at the same time.
Never bet against Tesla.
Tesla please hit 920 today so I can go see neon titties at edc with the homies this weekend.
Not sure what you are referring too here? I am constantly seeing news headline of governments buying Tesla'as Mega packs. Here's one from yesterday. https://www.business-live.co.uk/commercial-property/construction-starts-tesla-powered-battery-21923545From the energy side - Tesla is production constrained. The backlist of people wanting a Powerwall is huge - same with solar roof.  Problem is they tend to keep having to divert batteries to the auto line to meet the demand there.
I thought my life needed a bipolar gf, but really it was just Tesla fd's I was missing.
No he was asked recently and said he has no short position on Tesla anymore. He also said the media took his position and blew it way out of proportion.
That‚Äôs cheap for Tesla stock
When you think about it, it's not strange. Apple has good products, but they're way overpriced. So anyone who's smart with money will buy an Android unless they already have so much money they no longer car.And to bring this back to Tesla Tesla is Apple quality but for an Android price. Literally anyone should want one.
TESLA PRINTS DIFFERENT ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë
If Tesla goes past 900 ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll go under 900 anytime soon. That wall has to be massive
# TESLA ABOUT TO HAVE THOSE +100 DAYS. GET IN BOYZ, ROCKET JUST FUELING UP
Tesla and Tilray üòç
Cathie wood has a bigger üçÜ than Michael Burry. Tesla absolutely printing.
Cathie was called an idiot for buying the Tesla dip üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Whoever sold their Tesla calls at open show yourself. You need to be publicly shamed for such stupidity.
TESLA 950 BY END OF TOMORROW. HOLY FUCKING HULK DICKS.
Tesla went up an entire Ford market cap this week‚Ä¶      That is big dick energy
Tesla 900 is not a meme
Tesla is unbeatable
Except nobody is buying their solar panels or the batteries. 85% of the revenue is automotive. Watt for watt, the Tesla solar roof is almost twice as expensive as dedicated PV panels.
Coin 320 , Tesla 880, spy 454, let‚Äôs goooo
tesla 10/22 1000c gang report for duty!
Despite Evergrande, China is still the holy grail for any retailer/manufacturer. China's domestic consumption power is actually phenomenal. If Tesla kill it in China in the next few years it will be incredible.
So, I don‚Äôt necessarily agree that Tesla is going to rule the automotive world. There are a lot of other well financed competitors that will get off their ass and start making electric vehicles now.But I read someone commenting last night about something that I do agree with, which is that Tesla is much more of an energy company than anything else. With all of the solar, batteries, electric cars, it‚Äôs kind of like they will be the Apple for the energy delivery ecosystem. You buy their solar panels, buy their batteries, buy their cars, just the same way you buy an iPhone and then have to do everything through the App Store.And folks spend a shit ton more on cars and electricity and energy than they do on their cell phone.In that regard, and if Apple is worth $2 trillion, then maybe Kathy Wood is right that Tesla can be a 3 trillion market cap.Every time I think Tesla is overvalued, I put my money where my mouth is, buy some pots, lose money until I close them out, and realize that Tesla is far more than a car company.
Tesla Fremont Capacity aims to ramp to 900k/yr by end of 2022.Tesla China can ramp to 750k/yr by end of 2022.Tesla Berlin aims for 500k/yr by end of 2022.Tesla Austin aims for 500k/yr by end of 2022.900+750+500+500=2650k or 2.6M vehicles in 2023. This is on track with 70% growth over next 2 years, which is consistent with Elon stating 50% CAGR with new few years having higher growth.Rather than declining, ASP is increasing. Currently is ~50k. Let‚Äôs drop this to 40k in 2 years. Margin is also increasing. It‚Äôs currently 30%. Let‚Äôs maintain this because we Tesla Berlin and Austin will use 4680 cells which are cheaper and use Gigapress. (Note Elon is targeting 40% margin).This is 31.8B in profits. At a 1T market cap this is 31 P/E ratio.If Tesla can make FSD worth the 10k and brings take rate to 50%, you can slap on an extra 5k of free margin to the ASP. If Gigapress can actually remove hundreds of robots, and 4680 can really cut battery cost by half, you can slap on another 10k of free margin.If Tesla solves FSD Robotaxi, all numbers go bonkers.
Best part of owning a Tesla isn't the blowjobs, it's the angry looks on the cucks you fly by.
Cramer was shilling Tesla on CNBC to get viewers. Top confirmed
Bc Austin and Berlin are gonna print about a bajillion cars. Tesla to 6 trilli by 2030
RemindMe! 9 days "SHORT TESLA mad gains"
I work for a public utility in CA, we can‚Äôt get their fleet trucks orders fast enough. Demand and lead times on 550s and 250s is huge right now. Tesla is not going to be outfitting municipalities and work fleets with cyber trucks. F is set up perfectly to continue to fill this gap.
Tesla is going to go out of business in a year tops. My 3d printer is working on a model s as we speak. Lol at buying anything when you can just make it.
Tesla does not have any peers.
This argument that the competition is coming, is based on one thing. Inevitability. And it's backed up by the reasoning of 'of course they will'. That's it. That's the end of the argument. Because there's nothing deeper than that.They don't have the cell supply. Research how much each company has access to. How much each one is planning on building, and when. Building an EV with a larger battery is WHOLEY different than building an ICE with a large tank.In all the areas you're flat out WRONG:  'entire industry' - Toyota isn't even trying. They're planning over the next \~4 years to make a factory with less than 1/3rd of Giga Nevada as of 2021 to pack them into hybrids.VW is in freak-the-fuck-out mode right now with multiple all-hands-on-deck meetings, fretting that Tesla has a MANUFACTURING ADVANTAGE over them. Start to finish for VW BEV? 30 hours. Tesla? 10. VW's GWh target by 2030? 240GWh. Tesla's? 3,000 GWh IN ADDITION to purchasing all they can from Panasonic, CATL, LG, etc. Ford? Same story. Too small of a target, too far out.Bookmark this. Set a reminder for 3 years. When we come back and look at the Q3 2024 results I expect Tesla to be doing better than 1.25-1.5M units A QUARTER. And all those sales will be cutting into legacy auto who will STILL be losing money on their EV sales and trying to prop themselves up with ICE that fewer and fewer people want.
&gtTesla is \~70% of us EV marker, 13.9% of global market and \~2% of total Autocar market.Imagine this. The entire auto market is EV. Tesla has shrunk from a 70% market share to only a 20% market share.20%... of all vehicles. It puts them at the world's largest auto manufacturer. They'll also have the supply to dominate stationary storage. Regarding 'catching up'... If you're in a foot race with Usain Bolt and he has a head start, how do you expect to catch up? He's faster than you AND he has a head start.
Already has.  Tesla has forced EVs into the mainstream, shown they are not short on power, range, or speed.  ICE Automakers had a constant "15 year plan" for EVs.  Now they are scrambling.
Case and point, I thought iPhone would decimate and bankrupt all phone makers after it came out. It's by far the most profitable but over the course of a decade it's market share dropped.I feel like Tesla is likely to follow a similar trajectory.
Yall lost me $31 on $1000c on Tesla. Im out of here. Fuck yall
Tesla is dirt cheap if you actually do the math, i know this is WSB no one does math, but the current PE is 227 with the todays earnings...if you extrapolate today's numbers with Austin and Berlin outputs = to China, you'll get \~15 PE at todays stock price....this doesnt even account for FSD or energy which both could be bigger than auto...thus 3000/sh is a bear case price in the market today.
Tesla is about to break this man.
When tesla has basically pushed all their resources after 15 years to the cheap 3 and Y because nobody really wants the expensive ones why are all these new startups pushing 100k cars destined to fail . Any car lover spending 100k + will get the Porsche , benz or the plaid .Nobody will gain market share in America over the next 5-10 years unless a legacy company like Ford or Toyota says ‚Äú we are done with gas and putting all our money into EV ‚Äú and that will never happen until it‚Äôs too late . It‚Äôs like Walmart watching Amazon grow for 15-20 years before finally investing in e-commerce .I‚Äôm thinking about dumping everything into tesla as I see more and more shit EV startups popping  up
Tesla took a tumble there eh
The top 10 car manufacturers on the planet sell a combined 39 million cars a year. Their collective market cap is 845 billion a year as of today‚Äôs market close. Tesla hopes to sell 800,000 cars this year and their market cap was 867 billion as of market closing. They are so ridiculously over priced it‚Äôs comical. They basically have all their future sales for the next 20 years ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù to their stock today.
https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/20/tesla-takes-51m-impairment-charge-for-bitcoin-in-third-quarter/
I'm frankly amazed considering the recent economic climate.  My mind was shouting at me to pare back on my Tesla stock but my instincts were all "Nah, it'll be fine."   So I let them be.That's OK.  Chances are good it will drop dramatically in price tomorrow despite this minor miracle.  Then explode upward in value in May after a video of a Tesla deconstructing into its component parts on the freeway at 60 mph goes viral.
because you buy the rumor and sell the news. Tesla was ramping up over the last week in expectation of these earnings.
Tesla does it again and no one is surprised.  Elon can‚Äôt be stopped!
B-b-but its also a software company or something like that. Even if tesla sells 10x the cars they make now they still wont justify their share price
Tesla is quite overvalued now.When I had Tesla, I bought most in the 2019 crash, Tesla P/S was closing on 1 (it is 23 now, which is high even for a pure tech play), revenue grew massively for 4 years, but stock barely moved. More than 90% of its revenues are from cars, will sell about 800k this year, market cap $825b. Toyota 10M vehicles sold, less than 1/3 market cap.Tesla‚Äôs revenue growth is insufficient to justify the current market cap.
You lost the cost of a Tesla‚Ä¶shorting Tesla.
I've been saying this to my brain washed brother for the past year..he swears tesla will literally be the only car company in the next 5 years...
Tesla is astronomically overvalued, but you'd have to be crazy to short it.  I admire the spirit though.
Been saying this for years, Tesla is 100% American and gets treated like crap.GM Ford are "assembled in mexico" but because they are unionized they get a pass.Musk is an engineer above all and wants to make a better world.
I heard today on closing bell. That Tesla only carries 60% of the EV sales in total  I get they are only 3% of the  entire auto market. But they are the lions share of the EV market going forward.
Tesla is insanely overvalued sir
This was a super tame after hours for a post earnings Tesla
Apple brought in over 20 billion in profit for each of the last three quarters... literally 15x net profit.For a company with such a high valuation it's not impressive at all. Tesla is the GME of cars. Bring on the downvotes)
I‚Äôm not sure ‚Äúundervalue‚Äù and ‚ÄúTesla‚Äù have ever been muttered in the same sentence .
Imagine being too poor to get Tesla options... Oh wait.. üòÖ
&gt I don't own Tesla stock, I don't simp for Elon. But I would buy the truck because I like the way it looks. So fucking what?^This ^is ^a ^bot, ^don't ^listen ^to ^it
I don‚Äôt understand how Tesla is more valuable than Toyota, GM, and Ford combined.
Are the batteries in a Tesla AA or AAA Energizer?
Pretty great call. Tesla almost made as many cars this quarter as Toyota makes during their smoke breaks.
Tesla slow bleed back down to 800 or shrek cock to 900 eow? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)
Tesla tomorrow gonna be -3%
Tesla isn't a FANG stock its TANG stock. Tesla and Not Gonna compete with us stock.

Burry belongs in this subHe bought tesla puts had insane gains then diamond handed them until they were worthless
ur dad has a Toyota with a Tesla tatoo
Tesla beat EPS by 17% and revenue by 0.95%. That's not enough to move the needle especially after such a steep climb before the report.
Buying Tesla calls at open tomorrow for next week‚Ä¶ def getting price updates on Tessie
No one is doubting TESLA, their doubting the company valuation.
RIP to my Tesla calls

Tesla after hours is going to be wild. üçø
Watch Tesla cuck everyone and stay flat after earnings
Just from 1 good play (tesla)
Play of the day on TSLA for earnings. Assuming earnings are mostly priced in. We sell Iron Condors:$TSLA $880 call **SELL** $TSLA $885 call **BUY**$TSA $845 put **SELL**$TSLA $840 put **BUY**You **receive $320 credit** with a maximum loss of only $170. Tesla must stay below $883 and above $841 until this Friday. We sell 10 of these and collect $3,000 by end of the week.
I'm not going to defend her price target, because she's kind of insane, but people are downplaying how valuable the AI portion of Tesla is. Go look at a YouTube channel like AI driver, and look how the current build of autopilot is managing driving in San Fran, literally edge case city for FSD. They're no longer 5-10 years off, the improvements are coming faster and faster, at this point I know adult drivers who are far less secure in their driving than the current FSD beta. Once they crack self driving on pure vision, it's over for every lidar based self driving company. That data set is also valuable in itself, in that Tesla has millions of objects labeled, and a system that knows how those objects are likely to act Imagine the possible applications for their system outside of self driving cars.
Guest on CNBC: *Uh I‚Äôm not sure what Tesla does‚Ä¶ do they have the same shareholders as Upstart?*
I‚Äôm with her on deflation. Automation will make everything cheaper unless we keep printing money to cause inflation. But 3k Tesla? That‚Äôs all other car companies + Alphabet in market cap. She‚Äôs going to have to explain to me what technology is worth that much that no other company is working on.
That robot is never being produced. I don't know why Tesla stock goes up, it's stupid, but I'm here for the ride anyway.
WSB going bearish on Tesla? Time to buy calls
Bb better go brrr today and we holding tesla or selling
If the equities bubble keeps inflating and the congress passes more free money ev credits, this could happen. Plus Tesla made that robot. Elon Musk is a genius.
Tesla earnings today, everyone get your $1000 calls for friday so it can go down $15 Tommorow
TLRY will be the tesla of the cannabis sec imo
Tesla is literally the future bro. The market is just pricing in every man women and Child on the planet owning a Tesla by 2023
Elon will be the last to sell and tesla is also the only public company that he owns so don't sell anytime soon, tesla energy+auto alone will get $TSLA to 3k by 2025.
My moneys on uranium. $ura Yellow cake is delicious. When you eat yellow cake it makes electricity. Thats what nikola tesla invented.
Just because you posted this, Tesla is going to 1000 tomorrow
Tesla: hold my beer
Where in FAANG does Tesla go? I don‚Äôt see it
Tesla is $20 away from its all time high how can you possibly be down almost $500 on it
It's never enough. Tesla could cure corona virus and it would only go up $50 a share and the next day bear analysts would be spamming that it's due for a correction.Michael Burry would buy more puts and Cassandra would have a melt down on twitter.
Did you do Tesla puts?
we need a QYLD bot to calculate monthly income in this case, roughly $29k a month..if only from the value of the tesla position
i purposefully keep 3-4 figures in my RH account for dumb money...i was jazzed about a 60% gain on my tesla fd...50 bucks richer baby!
Tesla to da moon
Tesla 1000 üöÇ
So Tesla really heading to 900+ huh
My 100x Tesla 10/29 1200c is up from .15 to .45
Alright Tesla let‚Äôs see 900 today so my way otm calls can print
Also apple calls and Tesla just for fun
The year is 2030. Elon and Dr Parik Patel are fucking hookers on Mars. Tesla is at $5,000 after a further 10 share splits. Life is good
You bought Tesla at 38? bro
Sluts love Tesla
Well if Tesla continues to moon I can buy me a house straight cash homie.
Do you think SEC buys telsa puts then announce a probe on Tesla
Yeah if you just bought Tesla in the past you would have made money. This guy doesn‚Äôt get it
Not true. It‚Äôs a limited edition of 100. That might be the retail price, but I have seen none for sale online for under 30k. Cheapest on the biggest second hand watch market Chrono24 is 31k and would be closer to 33 with fees / tax. It‚Äôs 37 shares of Tesla on my wrist
Yolod my entire account and margin into Tesla at $849. DCA down to $777 been eating instant ramen for months
These tesla bears getting angry over spy not tanking so they are jumping on to tesla.See you at 1k
Not Tesla.Doesn't mean the stock won't go down,  but earnings are going to be records. Again.
If Tesla hits 900 tomorrow I‚Äôll eat toothpaste
This is why everyone should buy puts when the market crashes. Stock price crash = no tendies to buy Tesla , the huge growth in Tesla this year is because the stock went up 10x so the cult used the profits to buy Tesla
remember that time elon tweeted "tesla price too high"
Good job - i am hesitant to throw money to Tesla at this price, but you did good !!!
Tesla will break a new ATH
Tesla going to 900 after hours or tomorrow this is gonna be legendary
Tesla retard strength lets go![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
I‚Äôm super bullish on Tesla I wish it would dip a little so I could buy a leap but short term option plays are really good right now
If I bought Tesla stock in July 2019 instead of my model 3, I‚Äôd have $1m
Spy 2.5% away from ATHTesla 4% away from ATHBTC 15% away from ATHWill any of them break ATH
Tesla on track to be 99% of the stock market by 2025. Bullish.

**"Tesla boss Elon Musk has addressed 200 Volkswagen executives via a video call after an invitation from the German carmaker's CEO Herbert Diess, who wants to galvanise VW's top brass for a faster pivot to electric vehicles."**Imagine being so confident that no one can challenge your EV supremacy that you dial into your competitors meeting to give them pointers.

!banbet TSLA 4% 4d or I‚Äôll rip 4 Tesla tequila shots out of a shoe
Heck yeah his mom (RIP, I'm sure she was lovely despite her son being a jackass) had a successful PR firm. I suspect this is how he made his connections to TSLAQ-related firms who needed a little "PR" work done. It seemed his only job was anti-TSLA twitter &amp media circuit Gordon Johnson before Gordon Johnson was doing Gordon Johnson things. I don't hate a lot of people, but this guy was calling female board members c*nts and (literally) hoping an autopilot vehicle crashed into a school bus and killed a bunch of kids, so Tesla could go under. (He said these things on a Quoth the Raven podcast, not linking out of respect for cunts everywhere). He's a liar, a piece of shit, and just a net-negative contributor to society. The world would be better off without him, and he deserves every bit of shit karma the world has delivered him.
&gt Tesla is a company that makes electric cars. Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and also SpaceX, which makes rockets. The bunny holding the rocket represents how much money you can make if you buy Tesla stock right now (the rocket).
Burry, the guy whose mega emotional about his trades and quits Twitter more often than I get laid, saying Tesla ‚Äúwas just a trade‚Äù is the epitome of ‚ÄúI was joking dude relax‚Äù
Mark my words, Starlink will be used by the US military for defense purposes (if it isn't already). Tesla should 10x from here.
They are now only that Tesla has thoroughly proven that EVs are lucrative. They were all moving at a snail's pace when the Model S was first released.Musk is crazy and most definitely a once in a generation genius. The people that continue to try to say otherwise are the same people that have made excuses about his successes time and time again. How many massive successes does the man have to pull off before people admit he is doing something right? Yea he is a nutcase, but most people that intelligent are in some fashion.If you don't think so, then ignore Tesla. Look at SpaceX alone. The company has completely eclipsed, in every metric, every other space launch entity on the planet in a little over a decade. The falcon 9, and its heavy configuration, is now the most successful rocket, and cheapest per weight, in the world. Did he just get lucky? Again?
But whats your argument for Tesla failing?  New Companys building EVs too? Thats the only point? The Market Growth is simply outpacing teslas producting. The valuation is not based on a 100% market share, its based on a 10-15% market share my friend.Look at poor apple. Since they startet selling Android phones their sales went to 0 ?
So is tesla sharing my driver safety score automatically? I sure as shit had 4 forward collision warnings yesterday alone ü§ì
For real, I am not invested in Tesla stock outside of its inclusion in some of my index funds, but I wouldn‚Äôt bet against it any time soon.
I mean Tesla has been the only car company that has taken electric vehicles seriously, and it shouldn‚Äôt be a shocker that the stocks is valued high because no legacy car maker has taken electric vehicles seriously.
Once again‚Ä¶ I know everyone loves getting Reddit awards throwing shade at Michael Burry for shorting Tesla. Has anyone realized that he made money doing it? Are we all pretending that the stock didn‚Äôt go from $900 a share to below $600 a share? Burry made a good play and made money, if you would have been buying puts on Tesla when he announced he was shorting it you would have made money too‚Ä¶ the guy likely shorted hundreds of thousands of shares and made a minimum of a $100 a share doing it. Bulls make money, Bears make money, and Pigs get slaughtered.
Made a put on tesla.Lost.Seems it is true...never bet against Elon Musk. Learned my lesson
The time to short Tesla is when interest rates go up.
Tesla is more 'nimble' because it's more 'auto'cratic. That's one of the chief benefits of founder lead entities.
Merge absolutely never. VW is way too small in market cap to get favourable conditions, and Tesla would never want to have to deal with all the liabilities of outdated factories and staff with the direct opposite of Tesla's innovative company culture as it would have a huge negative effect on their efficiency.VW running Tesla software seems like a given to me. Perhaps not the OS, but almost definitely the FSD software once Tesla decides to start licensing it.
I never short Tesla. It‚Äôs a beast
Just like the 2020 Tesla run
Burry: "Tesla position was a trade"ok dude whatever you say
Tesla is the world's fastest growing religion. He would suck Elons Toe if he could
Yea that‚Äôs dumb thinking everyone will be driving a tesla in 10 years, morons. Teslas will be driving everyone in ten years
So you‚Äôll never get any rust on your Tesla? ü§î
Don‚Äôt you think this is being priced in by the upward move this week? I definitely see 900 this year and possibly 1000, but in 1 week seems a bit extreme.  It then again it‚Äôs tesla so anything is possible
Short term yea pretty good prediction, sell the news is common for Tesla. It‚Äôll rebound quickly and continue its upward trend
I just sold off some stocks to invest heavy into tesla when markets open, let‚Äôs pump it next week
I‚Äôm buying tesla tomorrow soon as markets open will hold till she peaks 1k with you guys
With that low of a salary you shouldn't be gambling on a single stock. Tesla was on the brink of bankruptcy, you don't realize what risk you have taken. Obviously it was good luck, don't even think about repeating this again. This comment may not sound nice, I just want to address the unnecessary risk you are taking and the lack of funds to fall back on if things go wrong.
&gt I am not a fan of Tesla. I think the company is overvalued and will likely go bankrupt in the next few years.
In and out, I‚Äôve made good money off Tesla though since late 2018. Probably smarter to hold but you know how it goes.
I drive a Tesla so I can tell you why the stock went up. Engineering. This car is engineered to streamline the blowjob process. You get a girl in that passenger seat and play a little caroake. As soon as your Love Shack duet is over and her mouth is agape, throw your arm around her and pull her head in close. She'll understand what to do.    Once you get kicked out of the Wawa parking lot, turn that thing on Autopilot and launch a pop fly into her mouth. The ergonomics are pure blowjob. Tesla to 1000.
I‚Äôm so hyped, as a young man, I‚Äôve been holding onto Tesla shares since college and I was very lucky to have kept holding them up to the split!‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüèΩ I cannot wait to see what happens!

I love that I got shit on for investing in Tesla years ago and now all my family is sending me articles about how they are the only car company delivering record sales‚Ä¶ end of the day innovation wins. Great video üòÇ
You don‚Äôt think Tesla be like it is, but it do.  $1,000 this week!!!
Sparing Herbert Diess is so honorable. TSLAQ thinks we want every other automaker to die. The truth is, our goal is to transition the world to sustainable energy. Tesla can‚Äôt do it alone. Toyota doesn‚Äôt want to help. Stellantis can‚Äôt help. Ford and GM are barely trying. VW/Diess actually wants to help. If the board doesn‚Äôt handicap Diess, he may actually succeed and ensure VW survives long term. The most likely outcome in 10 years is that Chinese manufacturers will do what Japanese manufacturers did 30 years ago: build the most compelling and cost effective vehicles. I see them as Teslas true long term rivals. Legacy automakers will only survive via government subsidies.

Warren has a life long history of strong investment results, Cathie is a bit of a religious nut that went big on Tesla/tech and got hyped for a few years because of the active ETF idea.
#TESLA VICTRA
This is the way! Tesla Victa!
You know, when you assume that Tesla will reach a market cap of 4 to 8 trillion in 10 years, I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter what you do huh?  I mean if Tesla in 10 years will be worth more than the combined valuation of FAANG, it‚Äôd be stupid NOT to do it.
NIO will succeed and is forecasted by multiple analysts to continue to grow over the next year. You may be on to something if you take up some option calls in the next 2-4 months. Their battery share program is insane and they are projected to make wayyy more stations in the next year. With that said Tesla is an incredible car company, they make a beautiful product and are very sought after. However competition within the next 1-2 years is a very real possibility. If Musk can continue to drive costs down enough so that the average consumer can buy one then you have a recipe for success especially long term. But with competition on the horizon it may only be a short term play to take up call options in it. This is Not financial advice.
Tesla is a safer bet, but Nio likely has more potential for growth.  It's risk vs reward.  Personally I'm 80% Tesla, 20% Nio for the Yolo play.
He‚Äôs a momentum trader. Buys breakouts and sells quick in a day or two. I‚Äôm not surprised he doesn‚Äôt know what UPST does. He Probably doesn‚Äôt know what Tesla does. He scans charts looking for setups in high RSI stocks. He made most of his money in the 90s. Not sure how much his system really works anymore.
Netflix, Tesla, Chipotle and Snap üöÄ PS WHY AREN'T YOU SLEEPING GUYS?
Did Burry really take a loss here? He bought puts when TSLA was pretty high IIRC. Tesla had a massive downturn in March. If he cashed out his positions and don‚Äôt get greedy, he probably made bank
Yea but lately Tesla kills it on earnings and the stock dips the next day. It takes a few weeks for the slows to get it through their head where the company is going. It also means you could sell them for 2 weeks out and after earnings, even if the price goes up the volatility will go down and the calls may be worth less.
I don't know dick knob it's not my DD. Go ask Burry. I don't give a fuck about Tesla stock.
When chip shortage ends, will there will be another split since Tesla needs more Giga factory up to make legacy autos and Burry eat their shorts
A tasteful thickness. Paul Allan has been selling Tesla puts to bears since 2013.
It‚Äôs more about his conviction than the dollar amount that makes it humorous. Dude has spent the last year painting Tesla as the biggest scam of the century. He predicted it‚Äôd fall below $100 and actively called out Elon on Twitter for running a circus. He does this with every big prediction. It‚Äôs good theatre when he‚Äôs right. And he just deletes Twitter and disappears for a few years when he‚Äôs wrong until people forget about it.
I love my Tesla stock.
Everybody posting Tesla gains/yolo‚Äôs today lol
But that's not him talking about his prediction. He literally said Tesla, sub 100, 2022. I'm not a Tesla or Musk fanboi nuthugger, but I'd bet my wife's boyfriend's billions that Tesla will in fact go the entirety of 2022 never crossing sub-300, let alone 100.Have you ever driven a Tesla? Choice. I recommend. My wife's boyfriend lets me drive his when he is railing my wife in the back. It's a great car.
2013 damn. OG Tesla homie.
Two things can be true at the same time. The media sensationalizing his put position and him saying Tesla would be under $100 after a year. Both happened
No kidding. Would love to be able to buy and hold with that much liquidity. Takes guts. Gj OPI think people should realize that $450k turned into $1.9 mil is an enormous feat. I cashed out of my Tesla position when it was $800 pre split. I kick myself for unloading but I thought 100% gain was good enough and especially with all the bear articles coming out left and right. So, for OP to hold and ignore all the noise deserves some serious respect in my book. üçªüëäüèª
TSLA is unrivaled. It was silly in the first place to bet against Tesla. Furthermore, TSLA is valued higher than all of the major automotive companies combined and is pumping out their products in record numbers, despite ‚Äúsupply chain issues‚Äù that all of the other automotive makers are discovering along the way of their very delayed entry into the EV market. The big players need to stay in their lane and not go all in on EV when one reigns supreme in comparison. This is how GM will go bankrupt a second time F, their first time. TSLA applied to become an energy supplier in Texas. Their factory in Berlin will further push the deliveries to record numbers. Starlink is now in talks with major airline companies. SpaceX will commercialize space travel at an affordable price for the average citizen. What is there NOT to invest in here?TSLA PT in 2025, $4000. Remind me in 2025 of this post, bot.
Awesome gains on your Tesla shares.
Tesla $1000 is $5000 presplit. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4901)
Tesla go brrr! I bought three shares yesterday. Already made some $.
Fuck Burry Tesla big üöÄ
Bruh Tesla just keeps on ripping
Exactly right. Tesla has become a great company, but let's face it, half its market cap is because they sold a narrative.
I drive a Tesla so I can tell you why the stock went up. Engineering. This car is engineered to streamline the blowjob process. You get a girl in that passenger seat and play a little caroake. As soon as your Love Shack duet is over and her mouth is agape, throw your arm around her and pull her head in close. She'll understand what to do.Once you get kicked out of the Wawa parking lot, turn that thing on Autopilot and launch a pop fly into her mouth. The ergonomics are pure blowjob. Tesla to 1000.
Tesla gained $8 billion market cap *today*.
After losing 50% of my gains on puts in the last month, I have decided to become a permabull. Literally nothing can cause the market to crash at this point. They could announce MegaCovid and SPY would rally to 500. Natural disasters? Priced in. Major global shortages? Transitory. Inflation? Not in my country. I cant wait until Tesla valuation passes the national debt and Elon buys the USA for the meme.
Is 10 years Tesla will be worth much more.
Guessing the property market crash via insider banking information is a bit different to hating on tesla and Elon to make him fail
How's that going? VW is shitting their pants at their failing China sales and their production inefficency. They're targeting 2030 to make as many GWh in EU as Tesla is targeting in 1/2 that time.Ford only makes any money on a Mustang MachE because it's made in Mexico. Ford Lightning is going to sell, but so what - all EVs are selling well. I'm *so amazed* that they're targeting 80k units per year by 2024. Toyota and Honda are shitting the bed when it comes to EVs. GM is doing... what? Building their own giga battery factories with partners? Congrats, you're 4 years late to the party.This is Tesla's decade. They've already won.
I'll be the stripper who has 4 Tesla puts
To be fair, tesla is gunna tank when interest rates go up‚Ä¶.again he underestimated the ability of the fed to just completely eradicate the middle class by letting inflation run rampant. I mean everybody here is literally a retard for being happy Tesla going brrrrr and the rest of the market going brrrr it‚Äôs like y‚Äôall can‚Äôt stop staring at the slot machine lights. Then again neither can I‚Ä¶.
He was short at the time and wanted Tesla to dilute to send share price down.
Fucking clown wiped all his reputation with Tesla puts
I don‚Äôt understand Burry. He sends a tweet out telling Tesla to do a capital raise for sustainability which they did and then he comes out and says he is short now. I mean guy is indecisive.
&gt @VisualMod, I am doing well. My Tesla puts are up over $1 billion since the start of 2017.
Funny thing is tons of Tesla owners have sold their cars to used lots for more than what they paid due to supply constraints over the past 6 months with new and used cars.
The stock market is like a religion, it isn't always logical. Just look at Tesla for instance.
Somebody on Fintwit sold some of his Tesla a few years back to buy a Tesla. He said it was the biggest mistake he's ever made. Because of how much Tesla has appreciated that car basically cost him over a million dollars
No Tesla has absolutely crushed this quarter
resale is fucked on Teslas. "like new" are going for higher than sticker because people don't want to wait. Every month they have to spend gassing at these prices is money lost when your Tesla lease is the same amount as your gasoline costs lol. I bought a Model X over a year ago and could sell it today for more than I paid. Used car market is hot, Tesla's especially.
Be Burry* Predict crash of the century every month for years* Make a hundred million bet against Tesla* Lose everything* Make a last ditch effort shorting internet money* Lose everything* Delete Twitterhttps://twitter.com/litcapital/status/1448988226954350593
Analysts are fucking stupid, and follow the market. I have observed my stocks going down, and then these sheep follow weeks after. I keep buying. Then it doubles, and THEN the analysts call it a buy. Tesla is a manufacturing company with low margins trading at 20x sales. Don't listen to these trend-chasing idiots getting paid by their coke sniffing clients.
Wtf WSB, why is a post of some guy‚Äôs 10 shares of Tesla and a 60% gain being upvoted. Most boring shit I‚Äôve ever seen
Is this what WSB is now? We‚Äôre upvoting a dude posting a screenshot of his 10 shares of Tesla with a whopping 60% gain? GTFO
I hate when people tell me‚Äú oh u have no kids , who will take care of you when you age ‚Äú Mother fucker ? A Boston dynamic robot with a AMD chip mother fucker That who I ain‚Äôt binging no human to this fucked up world to suffer Fuck no All my millions I made of spy$ and Tesla$Will go to some type of medical research Or puppies non profit I wonder if I can yolo my cash after I die if I have that on my will ? ü§î
For every people that invested in Tesla ''knowing'' it would grow, more people invested in other companies that went bankrupt ''knowing'' it would grow.It's called survivorship bias.People guessed all over, some were right, you're choosing to look at that group and you're excluding the other half.
China comprises nearly 20% of world GDP.  Large market cap companies like Apple, Tesla has significant sales in China (15%, 25%).   If this is not contained, China will head to a recession. This now has global effect unlike 20 years ago.   2007/2008 GR, market too a long time to bottom and come back.  The pandemic was raging for several months before the market OMG and started crashing.

TLRY has the advantage of having a lot of infrastructure worldwide which will make it easier to capitalise on the market locally. Financials looking decent is a very good sign if you consider that we are still at the beginning of the process. We all know how many years Tesla wasn't looking good which is at least somewhat comparable since Tesla also had to build the groundwork for the niche it is very successfully filling now.
Michael Burry is trying to cancel himself so we dont see his portfolio fucked to oblivion by tesla
The Big Short 2 Michael looses it all to Tesla
Burry should cage fight a Tesla roadster to settle this dispute like man
Holy shit Michael Burry is losing his mind on Twitter.  Elon has broken this man.  Shouldn't have shorted Tesla you autist.
cathie wood buying crispr right before it dropped 10% is the funniest shit, she got so lucky with tesla lmfao
Betting against tesla huh? How many times does elon have to teach you this lesson old man
Tesla Market Cap: $808 Billion  GM + Ford  + Toyota +Ferrari + BMW + Honda + Daimler + Hyundai + Mazda + Subaru+ Volkswagen = $807 BillionNot sure if puts or calls ü§î
I held Tesla for a year and got out with some juicy tendies. I swore I got out while I could and would never go back, but you fucking autists have me crawling back for more.
Loan officer called about my missed mortgage payment, told him to hop of my meat I‚Äôm balls deep in Tesla calls
I presume you mean ‚Äòwithout the use of credits‚Äô Which is a benchmark that was achieved in Q2 this year. [a source](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594778/tesla-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-profit-credits-emissions-bitcoin)All indications are that will extend into Q3 where their high margin Plaid variant is providing almost pure profit (nearly all of the production costs were still being carried in Q2 despite sales not happening until q3).
I came here to see all the people saying tesla is overvalued, I was not disappointed. Tesla only go brrt, they are in a good position to overtake the car market in the chance of a recession with their gigapresses.
Tesla to the moon baby, 1k eoy
If Apple and Tesla theoretically partnered on a car would the stock market simply explodeü§î
Toyota is car company. Tesla is a tech company that sells cars‚Ä¶
Latin is always spot on, for example Tesla is *Elanus Muskus Rollercostis*
You should short Tesla then, like Burry.
Brown lay down, black fight back. Grizzly pray to a higher power as you will meet them soon and it's polite to call first. This bear play dead or lure it away with Tesla puts that expire in 2 days
Well I made a goal to turn $1k into $10k by EOY in March. I got all the way to $4.5k and lost it all with Tesla calls last week. I have $200 left to turn into $10k. It‚Äôs fourth quarter with 0 time outs
elon musk: ‚ÄúThe excellence of an engineer matters tremendously. There are huge differences in engineering talent that boggles the mind. **But I do wonder, if Nikola Tesla applied to Tesla, would we even give him an interview? I‚Äôm not sure we would.**‚Äùfucking lmao.
Unless Tesla starts adding industry standard charging connectors, nope, not happening. Especially in regions where they sick of the connector bullshit and legislated a specific one.
Get non Tesla solar and save 50k.
Amazon stock never experienced what we are experiencing now with Tesla
I bought a Tesla and then I opened 100 85/86 Jan 21, 2022 GUSH debit spreads in early March. I can't tell you how much this makes me smile!! Fuck high gas prices but damn I love it!!
can you go 10 years back and post this same comment but instead of tesla say Amazon.... You know.... because people said the same thing.
Tesla also had a near bankruptcy on the ramp up of model 3 production. coincidence?
As I observed to someone else, I find this analogy particularly interesting because of Apple's near-bankruptcy in the 1990s.The analogy tells me more about the people bringing it up than it does about Tesla )
So you‚Äôre hoping for a black swan event to happen twice in 2 years in order for Tesla to crash? U know like 90% of the market crashed that much in 2020 then rebounded right?  U know it‚Äôs called a black swan event because it‚Äôs extremely unlikely right?
It's possible that the Tesla charger is widely adopted, and that becomes the primary way Tesla makes money, rather than by making actual cars.
By most metrics, it's massively overvalued?Its major products are in no way immune to competition, and there's no particular indication that it even has the best models of them?It's most known for vehicles, but has a tiny fraction of the market, and global adoption is  being massively delayed by a lack of infrastructure which - if it is adopted - won't necessarily be primarily used by Tesla.It's a meme stock, however, and that perversely gives it a weird value of its own.So, ultimately, it should crash because meme stocks, generally, aren't a sound way of valuing a market.I'm not long or short but that, presumably, would be why.
I don't understand why people laugh at burry for his Tesla short...He literally sold the top and we literally won't know if he bought back and got out of his short for another few weeks/months....If the average moron investor could identify that 570 triple bounce, you can bet his teams of chart-starers were also largely aware... He probably exited.
Because in regards to Tesla, it's not if, but when.
How bout you put your money into some Tesla puts like Burry then?
If Tesla ever dips by 70% and the reason is not because Elon Musk died I think everyone here, even likely the Tesla bears will take out a second mortgage, max out their cc and leverage themselves to the titties on TSLA lol
He disclosed his short position when Tesla was at $650 in December 2020. The lowest point after that has been $560. 13% dip isn‚Äôt exactly the 90%+ crash he was predicting.
i don't care, i bought some more stocks of tesla.
There is no rebuttal. Tesla is highly overvalued. Problem becomes when will it crash and how much?If Covid like event were to happen next year (not a virus this time but equivalent black swan), Tesla will crash 70-80%, something like Apple 30%.If growth starts to stall, other external factors, any new investors to Tesla (Yolo) will be in a dire situation, especially if on margin.
LOL, Tesla PE ratio was above 1000 earlier this year, is just over 400 now, and will be approaching 100 by EOY if share price stays the same.  People don't seem to comprehend how fast Tesla is growing revenues.
Tesla was overvalued a year ago too, but that doesn't make it smart to short them.
Lol. So you are telling me in less than 1 year that Tesla market cap increase to be bigger than ALL top 5 ?? automakers is not priced in ? I get it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different this time.‚Äù
Burry blocking someone because they asked how his Tesla puts are going is a very weak move.
It probably is.Do you have a timeframe for a correction or some sort of catalyst for it to drop ?The problem with burrys investment strategy is that you not olny have to make the right prediction, you have to get the timing right as well. Bulls can afford patience to a far greater extent than bears can (except here where bulls leverage themselves into bankruptcy because they bough 0 days a week too early/late)Tesla is posting continuous growth and isnt stopping anytime soon. No it probably wont grow to the extent its valuation would justify but that could take years to become apparent. Tsla stock has a huge cult following as well which makes betting against it dangerous.
According to Scion 13f he actually bought more tesla puts in q2. But I agree with your overall sentiment. I only tease him to make myself feel better lol
There's literally nothing dumber than some retard on WSB with a $5k portfolio mocking Burry.I'm not a fan of Burry by any stretch of the imagination, but he's made more money in the market than any of us.Also I'm pretty sure he shorted Tesla and ARKK in January, so even this play you are all mocking should've paid out pretty well.
Are you guys saying Tesla isn't overvalued...at all? (don't assault me, let's have a serious discussion please)
They reduced their p/e by over 90% last quarter and it will continue to go down as they scale and make larger revenues. Tesla is not as ridiculously priced as many people think.
True, it‚Äôs difficult to short sell Tesla though because of the hype behind investor sentiment, how strong their growth outlook is, and because they‚Äôre in an industry that‚Äôs largely tech and disinflationary by nature
You guys do realize that once interest rates rise due to continued inflation, Tesla stock is going to get crushed.  Any company with a high P/E will, which is pretty much all of the NASDAQ.
Do you guys remember when Tesla posted they beat last quarter and rose to +14% after hours? Almost everyone here posted pics of drinks and celebrations and all of these calls.The following morning, the gains had vanished before the market opened and Tesla itself had opened red. And all of those posts and yolos.....deleted. one of the funniest things I had seen on this sub.
Imagine if SpaceX was publically traded? I think it would have a higher market cap than Tesla
&gtWell GM already has Super and now UltraCruise (and the brand, Cruise) so legacy auto is   &gt  &gtahead of Tesla  &gt  &gt in autonomy features.wtf..!RemindMe 1 year
Every day, Tesla builds cars. Then it sells those cars to customers, then takes that money from the customers, and uses it to build more cars. Then it sells those cars to new customers, rinse and repeat, growing each time, usually around 50% per year, but in the last few quarters, at 70%. Just like a ponzi scheme, but with selling cars instead of selling securities (Tesla hasn't raised additional capital in a while now and probably wont, seeing as though they are now FCF positive with the car/customer ponzi scheme).
Do you know anything about Cruise?. It is extremely limited and it will not have comparable functionality any time soon. For example now super Cruise works on small stretches of freeways where as autopilot works on all freeways and on main arteries in cities with stop lights. The fsd feature works on all streets. Admittedly fsd is not great but Cruise will never do what Tesla does now. They have some highly curated videos but i would bet $2M Cruise will never compare favorably to fsd and probably will never ship to customers. Their technology and software is garbage.
Ah Yes Nikola Tesla one of the smartst men in history fucked over by Edison
I feel this in my bones.But all my friends own Teslas or have ordered a Tesla now. Some even own $TSLA.
I see your caveat on understanding the limitations of back-testing, but I‚Äôd encourage a refresher in this area. One can easily backtest their way into just about any decision or perspective of their choosing. The S&ampP 500 is simply an index comprised of the largest 500 companies in the U.S. It‚Äôs widely used as a benchmark or broad economic indicator precisely because it isn‚Äôt weighted arbitrarily to a single industry. Instead, its component companies represent proportionally (by market capitalization) the makeup of the economy. Of course, it just so happens that in today‚Äôs world, technology stocks do in fact dominate the index because of that industry‚Äôs outsized role in the economy. The largest companies in the index are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Facebook, Tesla, etc. I guess my point is, if you‚Äôre invested in the S&ampP, you‚Äôre already pretty heavily invested in tech stocks. And I don‚Äôt find QQQ‚Äôs past performance to be a compelling reason to increase this exposure any further.
i talk about tesla to myself, sometimes (im slightly retarded)
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to tell you we at Tesla have over 60% EV market share in the United States‚Äù
Tesla üêª are F
Only two of her funds contain Tesla. The best performing one last year ARKG has no TSLA.
Time to buy TSLA and Tesla
It's not really fair to compare to tesla though. That might be most tesla holders best stock of their life.
the trouble with shorting stocks is the timing of it. there was wide (if not universal) agreement that Tesla was overvalued, but when would it drop? Michael Burry got it right while others lost fortunes. some research into the companies might give you an edge. for example John Templeton shorted a bunch of dot-com stocks by guessing insiders would sell at the end of the IPO lockups, knowing their iffy companies were crazy overvalued. he was right, insiders sold a ton of shares as soon as possible and that started a price drop.
She has never had a magic touch.No one would never know of her or care about her but three years ago she had a target price of $1,500 for Tesla and it was so outrageous that she got herself on TV, defended it and managed to sound coherent.  That's it.
There‚Äôs a Tesla dealership down the street from my house in Houston
Tesla also said they are expanding their California footprint at record speeds .Bay Area is too expensive to bring in talent to live there .
Amazon: in every home on a monthly subscription plan, has massive international fleet and workforce trillion dollar company.Apple: provides laptops, phones, etc to half the workforce and consumers, massive international operation, patents out the ass trillion dollar companyTesla: has sold in the course of its existence as many cars as GM does in one quarter, has one factory and is moving to Texas before the other one is even operational, hits public service vehicles or burst into flames daily trillion dollar company
Californias flag is literally a bear. This could mean big gains for Tesla.

Although an optimal move, without those taxes that CA generated, Tesla wouldn‚Äôt have gotten the funding to lift off either.  Can‚Äôt trust business people and I know that‚Äôs what I would do once I got the funding I needed

People will always come to California. Anyone who lives in a big city here will tell you that too many people coming is the issue, not too many leaving. (OP edited their stat by the way the population here continues to increase)But this is more about corporations and their tax dollars leaving, or their high paid employee tax dollars. Since Tesla gets a lot of incentives and tries to minimize the number of employees on payroll I don't see this as such a big hit for California really. It's not a positive but plenty more companies are setting up shop in Socal. Tesla will hardly be missed.
The STATE with an economy bigger than all but 3 other COUNTRIES in the world isn‚Äôt gonna sweat a drop over Tesla.
Exactly my point. In other cities Tesla leaving would be a tax base / brain drain issue. But in the Bay, nobody gives a single fuck.
It is most certainly not state regs. Every level of government in California streamlined and built them up along the way. California doesn't give out incentives like candy and housing is expensive for workforce. That's why there is the move. California has already moved on. Somewhere in the Bay is the Tesla of tomorrow. It's California. There is always another company starting.
In the Bay Area, Tesla doesn‚Äôt even count as a notable employer. 4 of 5 FAANGs have HQs there. Not to mention Genentech and a huge bio tech presence. Plus Telsa‚Äôs known to pay shit.
I‚Äôm staying üåàüêª because 1. Inflation is really really real2. Political instability in the US just has a bandaid on it right now3. Supply chains are all jacked up, reinforcing #14. Oil prices are climbing and climate activists are pushing government carbon controls that reinforce #15. China has been the growth market of the past 10+ years for Western investors and it is looking wobbly until this Evergrande thing clears up, which it may not 6. IR are rising again (finally)7. A lot of stocks recently hit ATHs and need to cool off-NFLX-LYV-SEAS(I hold puts on all three)Lastly the hot EV stocks need to start rolling out cars al-la Tesla and will be hampered by points 1,3,5 and 6Points 2,4,7 could help EVs start another run though IF production begins
Hey Gavin Newsom, If it doesn't bother you that Tesla is leaving CA it should.  You consider your state to be the leader in the renewable industry so you let Tesla slip through your hands to Texas?
Still building a Tesla warehouse/office building in my CA town.  Sall good.
Not relative to the average income in the area, even amazon pays warehouse workers more than Tesla pays autonomous testers, and I think we all can agree that Amazon isn't something to aspire to from a labor standpoint, and one is a semi skilled job and the other isn't. Might be high relative to the average income in Wichita Falls TX but that's completely irrelevant.
lol well paid? Most companies in my field pay 50-100% more than Tesla in the same area.
I hope California stops giving rebates to Tesla drivers.
For pointing out facts? I don't care if Tesla shifts their headquarters. I know its for tax purposes and thats fine. I don't work for them so I am not affected in the least. Its just a fact that many states engage in seeing who can provide the biggest tax cut, or even the biggest grant of money to super wealthy companies. Even Texas companies have moved to places like Arkansas and elsewhere for this reason. Not going to sit here and pretend otherwise. California does well enough generating its own new businesses, of which Tesla was one, and frankly I don't need to concern myself with that either.
Its a never ending race to the bottom of states giving out incentives. To be fair, a big part of Tesla's initial rise was California's own consumer tax rebate for buying electric cars that made Tesla seem like a more affordable option for many Californians. But now that they have grown to this international brand, they can chase the next incentive. Of course this is mostly a paper move. Probably next to nobody will actually move to Texas.
The bear argument for Tesla seems to be that the stock price is too high lol. All that tells me is that bears are having a tough time putting $790 dollars together lol. Does that sound like a bank account you want?
üòÇ bro, this is a business expense, not a personal expense. This is to save money for the shareholders (Elon being one). Not a Tesla fan or shareholder, but you go where it‚Äôs cheaper to operate your business for the sake of saving money for the business and keeping money in shareholders pockets. This has nothing to do with Elon musk being greedy.
The way California handles just about everything is ridiculous. That state is ran by complete morons. Great job Teslaüéâüéâüéâ
California made Tesla pay for that racial discrimination lawsuit?! That was probably the last straw‚Ä¶137 million dollars was the fine‚Ä¶The employee was a contract employee who only worked there for a year and it was decided by a San Francisco jury.And now this comes a few days later. Not a coincidence. Fuck Cali
I'm applying as a tesla engineer i have 2.5 years of experience at wendys
Those are short options, meaning he sold the options and collected the premium from selling and since Tesla stayed between his call and put strikes, they most likely expired worthless, which means he made max profit
I was told by Tesla bulls that Tesla has no supply chain shortages. Especially chips.Elon in the shareholders meeting right now said they‚Äôve had issues with this for the last year.
Your Tesla is going to blow up if you don‚Äôt laugh at Elon‚Äôs jokes
Every Tesla event looks so amateurish. They should copy Apple.

Wow Tesla about to announce teleportation
&gt That‚Äôs a $100k+ revenue for Tesla from me.At least the market cap makes sense now.
He got it right once. Became famous. Has been yelling ‚Äúfire‚Äù 1000 times since. Shorting Tesla while Tesla has record breaking sales, huge backlog of orders, increasing profit margins, new profitable business lines such as solar and power wall , new factories all over the world not able to meet demand‚Ä¶ A very successful American company in short. So, fuck Burry. He is just an impatient short seller who wants to profit from front running you and me if we believe him and if we short after he does. I am with Tesla. Buying a model y and solar roof from them. That‚Äôs a $100k+ revenue for Tesla from me.
He sold his gme shares at 11$Regarding tesla his position defintely bleeding and his wife boyfriend defintely moving in
All you broke fucks seem to forget he IS trying to help you.  In case you haven't noticed he's not the limelight type of person, he's already proved himself 100 times over and 100 times again and has NOTHING to prove to a buncha broke dicks buying WISH that should be rich off his GME play but instead they were so pathetic they refused 15000% profits trying to scratch out a lil' more.  I'm tired to people trying to bash the guy.  He never said when the crash would be and his timing on shorting tesla was pretty fucking spot as I recall his tweet on it.
Peter schiff isn‚Äôt right. Schiff just says the market is going to crash every month so he can write a book when it does. His shitty funds cost over 1% on fees and way underperform they sp500 Schiff is a bad bad man. Burry is just early like last time. He also doesn‚Äôt hate Tesla the company he just thinks the stock is bananas at current valuations. Elon just said this same thing at code.
Michael is just on a anti Tesla, anti market tirade. He‚Äôs Peter Schiff but without the Santa Claus beard
I had to return my Model S Plaid because the interior was starting to smell like piss. Not sure if it was defective or if Tesla is just such a young company their designers haven't learned how to make an interior that can handle as much piss as Mercedes or BMW

| ‚ÄúThis also means that any restrictions on Tesla associated with those loans have ended.‚ÄùMaybe they wanted to not have any restrictions from that loan. Retiring debt can be about more than just interest savings.
Who knew the best way to make money from tesla is by not having it in your portfolio :D
He got $6.9 million for suffering (still seems like a lot, but‚Ä¶) and $130 million was punitive for Tesla. Why this dude was awarded the entire amount is beyond me. Are there no other black employees at that plant, or was the supposed racism directed entirely at him? Nobody else saw the graffiti or heard the ‚Äúpervasive‚Äù n-word? That money couldn‚Äôt have gone towards some charitable program or diversity initiative? Making this guy thousands of times richer doesn‚Äôt seem like the best attempt at justice.
Fremont is in the extremely liberal bay area.  This guy also says he encourages his kids to get jobs at Tesla.    I call bullshit.
So this clown claims he was so distraught by the racism at Tesla but also encourages his children to get jobs at Tesla.Lawsuit shouldn't even have made it to court.
It's not. Only $6.7 million was considered a reasonable pay out. The other $130 million is for punitive damages. Meaning it's meant more as a punishment to Tesla than restitution to the plaintiff.
If I was Elon I would just declare bankruptcy and shut down everything, Tesla, SpaceX, Boring,NerualLink.  People cant keep getting away with this.
You Americans keep doing this shits, Tesla is gonna move to China one day...
Diaz had also encouraged both his son and daughter to work for Tesla.
Maybe this is what Burry saw through his magical glass eye: the fall of Tesla due to‚Ä¶lawsuits.. It has been written.

when your looking for the next: Apple, MSFT, AMZN....anything can happen. Bulls got what they wanted: Tesla figured out how to find chips in a vacuum and its stock price is getting the boost it deserves. What other company did not bitch too much about chips: Apple. And guess what, people got their new iphones/ipads no issue. Where GM, Ford, Stelantis are getting their lunches handed to them.
https://www.caranddriver.com/news/amp36651347/ford-mustang-mach-e-vs-gas-production/You‚Äôre right, they also made a terrifying 27k Mache in 6 months! That‚Äôs crazy... oh wait it was 10x less than Tesla made this quarter...Maybe their battery plants will help get production moving a bit faster, oh non of them will be online until 2026+ nvm
You really don‚Äôt have an understanding of the EV market or where it‚Äôs at. Tesla will be surpassed and by more then one company. The big four have better supply chain and production experience on top of already having a service plan in place that Tesla has yet to figure out. Tesla‚Äôs good but nothing the end all save all
So you‚Äôre wrong on 1 and 2, Ford already meets both of those and I have 2 models on order from them with my cost being $32,000 and $27,500 respectively, they also have far more production capacity then Tesla. And Ford also surpass them on points 3-4‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm not sure you have a full grasp of the ev market‚Ä¶.many companies currently produce hybrid/ev and have better customer satisfaction and higher production capacity then Tesla, without the lawsuits or massive repairs that Tesla has in the first 5 years of ownership.
A telltale sign that competition is in fact \*not\* coming for Tesla, is that Volkswagen's ID.3 takes [three times longer](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/10/03/volkswagen-bosses-labor-chief-want-big-changes-at-wolfsburg-factory/) to produce than a Model 3.
How can Tesla be so uncorrelated with market. It's moves on it's own and seems to not care about the S&ampP 500. Does it make it even more valuable?
This is not how the market works you schizo. People are betting against Tesla because it's grossly overpriced.
Tesla $900 eom?
Tesla is rallying when the SP500 is plummeting. You think this is sustainable during a significant correction? The price will just hit 800 and then it will definitely fall. Burry is not wrong, he was just a bit early, like usual.

Burry has called multiple things right since the MBS market implosion. He famously in the movie invests "only in water", well today the Gates Foundation I think is the largest private owner of arrable farmland in the USA so major players around the world have adopted this sub-strategy, eventho I dont know Scion's current exposure. Burry likely made a fortune off GME, he was one of the first to get in at 30-40 USD. He has been right on the rate hikes recently. His big bet now is Tesla going down, we will see how it turns out. But to say he is a one hit wonder is just wrong. And his portfolio includes a very large number of positions, not just 1 yolo.
I definitely see much higher prices on Food. The price increases are too fast to ignore. Every month I notice higher prices.Cathie Wood thinks technological innovations will have "deflationary" effect. She is betting on richly valued companies like Tesla, Palantir, and others who are the first to be affected by rising interest rates. High growth stocks will lose out to the value stocks in a rising interest environment.What are your plays if we are stuck with high inflation (4% now, but everybody keeps repeating "transitory"/"temporary") without Fed doing anything to bring it down?
I completely agree this is ‚Äúwhy‚Äù there‚Äôs a failing, but it‚Äôs pathetic to act like this is an excuse for a massive company to have zero ability to predict a future trend. The chips are outdated. It‚Äôs part of why people are excited by new car companies and their potential to bring new innovations.A company staying in their lane and producing old tech because it‚Äôs not in their financial bottom line interest to update, and then slowly crashing and burning because they become increasingly outdated, is not a defense. It should still be insulted.Unrelated but VERY related, I‚Äôm disgusted by how shit on-board car GPS systems update. It‚Äôs pathetic. My phone gets updated constantly, and I buy new phones regularly, and they work. Car manufacturers look at the software, and the issues needed to update them, and they wave it off as too much to deal with. But this is the WRONG answer because when a Tesla comes along and -actually has software that works correctly with an iPhone- the disparity is now unacceptable. A multi billion dollar company can‚Äôt figure out how to update an onboard GPS system? And yes, I‚Äôm aware they ‚Äúcan‚Äù update, but the process is horrible. In my case I had to write down a version number, check the factory website, the version number doesn‚Äôt even exist. I have to download the software to a thumb drive, run a process of starting and stopping my car while holding down buttons, let the software update, and it will not be able to tell me if it works, then drive around and ‚Äúsee if the GPS is desynced‚Äù and if it is, start over. GM, and all the other mainline companies have been happy to outsource all features and take NO responsibility for any of this stuff. Pretending they aren‚Äôt ultimately responsible for getting the end-user a proper setup, is liking putting their hands over their ears and yelling ‚Äúlalalalala‚Äù and people should be pissed. These old car companies are crap.Integrating hardware and software should always have been a priority. Keeping up with trends and technology should always have been a concern. If they‚Äôve refused to future proof themselves, I don‚Äôt see why we should act like it‚Äôs a defensible and understandable position.Teslas are out of reach for almost everyone - but we‚Äôll certainly jump ship as soon as possible.
‚ÄúAll Tesla needs is to exponentially increase production forever‚Äù
What's amazing is that they managed to increase production ***despite*** the global chip crunch &amp sharing some of those chips with legacy auto.Elon was pointing out supply shortages that is hurting legacy auto too, such as the Renesas fire:&gt https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1425765210007216134&gt&gt "**Most problematic by far are Renesas &amp Bosch.**" Tesla was able to grow despite this due to agility: they changed their controllers *19 times* this year alone to use available chip supply.
That would help explain why Tesla, with a big profit margin, can afford to absorb an increase in chip price, whereas GM, with more direct competition and lower profit margins, couldn‚Äôt absorb it as effectively. Also, corona has hit middle income people much harder than high income people who can afford Teslas.
Idk let's look it up. Tesla has one per 205million miles.Gm has had 12 total fires in the bolts.Digging a bit deeper and comparing the number of vehicles out in the market VS the number of battery fires.... Well the average is around 19 million miles for an ICE fire, so both good considering, but GM batteries actually seem to be more stable than Tesla batteries by about 2x.Guess Tesla just had much better PR ppl, no surprises there.The most surprising thing to me is that I couldn't actually find a chart comparison anywhere. I had to source a bunch of data from different sources to make a conclusion. So everyone firing off "yes" and "no" in the comments is almost certainly guessing based on how the PR has made them feel.
Lmao you are delusional if you think Tesla will grow exponentially 5 years in a row. You don‚Äôt think they would be there if they could?
And considering Tesla is almost like a religion, this one feels even more accurate:https://xkcd.com/1102/
Tesla Sold but doesn't say of they delivered all of them.
Just for a little context, in case someone else needs it: GM sold [more than 2.5 million vehicles in 2020 in the USA alone,](https://www.best-selling-cars.com/usa/2020-full-year-usa-gm-sales-chevrolet-buick-cadillac-gmc/) whereas Tesla sold [less than 500,000 vehicles worldwide.](https://www.best-selling-cars.com/brands/2020-full-year-global-tesla-car-sales-worldwide/)
Operating at a loss refers to net margin. You‚Äôre talking gross margin which is only takes into account the bare minimum cost of goods sold. Since Tesla is spending a fortune on R&ampD with their brand new tech, it‚Äôs either a completely dishonest or laughably stupid argument.
Tesla, like so many brands, was relying on China to inflate their numbers. Apple does the same shit. Sell a billion apple watches and shit to China's new middle class, then bundle that in with your global sales numbers to look way more impressive than you actually are. Because trends in China are fickle af, and the government is going to try to push you out and prop up a local competitor as soon as you gain any ground.This is the situation Tesla is in. They're no longer in the CCP's good graces, and China-based EV producers are gonna get propped up hard.Gonna fuck Tesla in the short term.
Bout to say, GM is a fucking juggernaut. There's no way Tesla is even close in sales.
Tesla is sort of tied to corona. Corona caused the interest rate to go to 0% and made the fed shit money. This has boosted car sales to all time high and then the chip shortage ruined competitors
&gtTesla batteries have about the same rate of fire incidents.Really?
GM also deliver more cars in a quarter than Tesla do in a year....
I'm not at all bearish on Tesla, but I also think Cathy's tweet is dumb as fuck. It doesn't need to be one or the other. Hell, I've made a few tendies off of Tesla, would have made more if I'd kept holding or bought in sooner.Edit: Also talking about what a company did 9 years ago as any bearing on what they're doing today seems... unwise.
Tesla only design their chip they don't currently manufacture said chips.
&gtAlso Tesla are expensive af, any big ICE manufacturers entering the EV market with cheap EVs will take the number one spot from Tesla sooner rather than later.They are but they aren't.You can get a Model 3 for $39,999 out there door for a base model.  Certainly more than most your GM/Ford/Whoever for a low end model EV.The new bolt starts at $33k and it nowhere near as impressive as the Tesla. The closest ford is the Mach E which starts at $42k base.
I don't know if GM has a backlog of preorders, but tesla has a fat one because they've only recently been able to hit mass production, so either way they weren't going to see a drop in sales in just a year unless tons of people canceled preorders.
They also preorder cars don't they? So, they have already sold some of the cars the chips they're ordering would be for.I would also bet the average Tesla customers was less affected than the average GM customer. Just a hunch I don't really have anything to back that.
See, weird, I promise you he doesn‚Äôt even give a slightest fuck.And congrats on making money, that‚Äôs what the stock market is for, but let‚Äôs be real, I think what Tesla started is great, but I think they‚Äôll be overtaken.As he even said, the stock price just needs one bad result and it‚Äôll deflate.
It's definitely not Tesla... Not even close
Also Tesla are expensive af, any big ICE manufacturers entering the EV market with cheap EVs will take the number one spot from Tesla sooner rather than later.
tesla has been struggling to fill preorders for like a decade and even now can only produce about 1/9th the amount of other manufacturers, so it wouldn't have made sense for them to cancel orders.
almost all of her top picks shot up because of COVID. literally blind luck and now shes down YTD because of full retard picks. Tesla is their largest holding and also the only one with gains that aren't directly tied to covid, not surprising that she shills like a retard for them.
So back in the old newspaper days, stocks had a "P/E ratio" printed right next to them because it was so important: the price to earnings (per year). The price of the share over the earnings per share - so the units are actually $/($/yr) = years. So with a P/E of say, 10, all the money people have invested is 10x the annual earnings. That doesn't give a ton of confidence to the company (not one listed on a major exchange, anyway!). A P/E of 30 means people expect this company to be around for a while, so people speculate and buy stocks (drives up price, or P) and/or the earnings are low (low E think Tesla or Amazon during their growth phase. Tesla spends so much money building superchargers they don't make a big profit... but in 30 years, who knows).OK, so that's P/E ratio. CAPE is just the P/E of a large block of stocks: usually S&ampP500 (largest 500 companies in the US). And the "CA" is "cyclically adjusted", meaning it goes back 10 years to account for any kind boom and busts (tech bubble, housing crisis).So CAPE represents how expensive stocks are as a whole. 30+ is expensive: a lot of people betting a lot that companies will do well. And historically, companies just tend to grow and die as usual, so there's a correlation in when there's high CAPE, the stock market doesn't do great over the 10 years. The real world catches up, people lose confidence a bit, but because it was so high to start.Note this does not mean you can time the market! You still can't - but if you look at 500+ stocks over the last 10 years, there is some apparent correlation to performance over the next 10 years.
I think I remember reading that Tesla isn‚Äôt as impacted by the chip shortage because they never cancelled their orders. My understanding is that the big players cancelled orders, manufacturers retooled to make different chips, and that‚Äôs one of the reasons there‚Äôs a backlog for automakers. Based on that understanding I don‚Äôt think Tesla is using any different chips than before
Apparently Tesla silently removed features dues chips short supply. Also EV or not the amount of chips is related to the amount of features, like ECU and the dash with the gadgets, ai driving, and extras, combustion or ev if the car is packed with stuff requires more chips to control said stuff, EV have more is electric componentes like the inverter is full of MOSFETs and controllers, but those are not in short supply.
And that's after GM got hit hard for Bolt battery issues, even though Tesla batteries have about the same rate of fire incidents.
Tesla's adoption is increasing exponential? Care to share some of that shit you are smoking?VW, Toyota, Mercedes etc. Are all catching up FAST. By 2024 Tesla will not be more than a luxury name in the EV market, but most definitely not main stream or exponential in growth.
Bad math, they sell about 7x more cars, 250k per quarter vs 6.8 million a year.  Ask people into Tesla they'll say it's an energy company and their batteries are the real value.  I say those batteries don't scale well and so aren't really usable for storing green energy for later use.
GM got 450,000 more chips every quarter according to our quick and dirty math that biases Tesla.That's 136% the chips Tesla received it's substantially more, and shows just how silly Cathy's tweet is.They had lots and lots full of cars waiting for chips...
It's 1.7M complete cars/qt. GM has a large stockpile of cars that haven't been delivered because they don't have enough chips to complete them. That being said, Tesla claims they got around the issue by rewriting their software so that they could use substitute chips and making their own chips which might be much more difficult for a company like GM who have many more models to do simply do to the sheer cost or the inability to pivot like Tesla. There's probably some other factors behind the scenes that also cause GM to suffer from negative yoy whil tesla experiences positive yoy so i would say the comparison is not so straightforward
So what you're saying is that GM got more chips than Tesla...Because 6.8M/4 = 1.7 million.Looks like Tesla wasn't chip constrained but GM was, just like they said.
Tesla also uses more powerful chips that dont rely as heavily on legacy hardware that GM uses.
They also use entirely different chip sets. I am an engineer for a major motor manufacturer, and [Renesas Fire](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56486242) seriously fucked up the global chip supply chain. Tesla gets their chips from a different supply chain and was unaffected. This tweet reeks of stupidity, and not even in the good way we are used to.
Also Tesla was always more consistent in their needs so they could keep the place in the order queue.  Where the others didn't want to be stuck with a glut of chips, so they cancelled their place in the queue.   Which in hindsight was a rather bonehead move.
I‚Äôd like to see a source that EVs require 3-5x more ‚Äúchips‚Äù. Even then,  not all ‚Äúchips‚Äù are in short supply and it‚Äôs possible GM has higher qualification standards than Tesla who is willing to either quickly redesign and skip extensive testing or swap alternative components applying similar lower standards.If you‚Äôre in the electronics business right now it‚Äôs not hard to find alternatives, but the verification overhead is a real problem.
GM sells 7 million cars a year. Tesla is lucky to do a 7th of that. "Supplying 7 million cars with chips is the same as 1 million," - Cathy "I get my stock tips from Jesus," Woods.
i put all my money into tesla stock at 735, I have nothing left in my bank account, **godspeed fellow retards, we are heading to the moon**
Tesla is a small company as far as production count. Their market cap is 10x GM‚Äôs.
F150 lighting and mustang ev will dawg Tesla sales. Tesla cult is crazy
The Lightning looks badass while the cybertruck is fucking ugly. Tesla is definitely the best ev carmaker on the planet, but they left the door open for Ford to take over the truck market.
GM = big company harder to grow. Tesla = small company easy to grow
What an ignorant tweet. GM still sold twice as many cars compared to Tesla.
Well I mean tesla sold 250k vehicles gm sells well north of 6 million vehicles a year...
Tesla does have fan clubs and you might be able to test drive one that way. Turo is another way to drive them.
Hopefully Tesla moons on Monday so I can short it again
Well that article was written by morons."Tesla deliveries are considered a measure of demand for EVs".  Lol what?Tesla deliveries are a measure of Tesla production plus logistical fluctuations.We have no idea what demand is actually like because we still can't meet demand. If Tesla manages to execute on their ambitious expansion plans we might find out in the next few years what the demand limit might be.
Tesla stock clearly needs to double
Nah, that's a myth that's being pushed by the likes of Toyota and oil companies that don't want people to switch. Making a CO2 comparison between an ICE vehicle and an EV is very difficult because the differences between models is gigantic, whether the battery is new or recycled plays a huge role and the difference in energy generation (coal vs renewable) also has a massive impact, but EVs are better CO2 emission-wise in anywhere between 2 months and 3 years worth of driving (roughly 15.000 miles per year).On top of that there's a lot of misinformation about batteries being harmful for the environment. Building them has a certain CO2 emission to it, there's no way around that for now, but other than that the resources can be mined and processed sustainably. Obviously this is not always the case yet, and there are lot of human rights issues with batteries using high amounts of cobalt as well (iPhones are notoriously bad in this regard), but Tesla is on the better end with all of those issues. They're largely phasing out cobalt and not mining it in the Congo for example, where the biggest issues are.On top of that, there's a lot of misinformation about battery recycling and how it's supposedly impossible. This is not true, Tesla already recycles 100% of the batteries it receives back and can reuse 90% of the materials from those batteries. Some companies can already hit up to 98% recycling of materials and there's a clear path towards 100% this decade. And best of all, recycling batteries is cheaper than building them from new materials, so the financial incentive to recycle them is very high (unlike for example with plastic).So no, anyone who's saying EVs will do more damage to the environment than ICE vehicles doesn't know what they're talking about, has fallen for the oil/legacy automotive's propaganda or has an ulterior motive. The science is very clear on this topic.

On top of the first comment which was spot on, you are speaking about ICE production it dosent matter anymore. ICE will not be produced in the future EV will therefore whoever is making more EVs is set up better for the future. Tesla is also growing faster along side demand for EVs, once again giving them a competitive advantage just because they can produce cars faster.
Lol bro I order Tesla service to do things at my house, from an app.
Yeah Herbert Diess allegedly said in a recent meeting of VW leadership that Tesla makes a model 3 in 10 hours and will make it even faster in Berlin while VW makes an ID 3 in 30 hours in their most modern factory in Wolfsburg, thus they need an even more modern factory than Wolfsburg.Wouldn't be surprised to see them suspend their dividend like Nokia did to help them catch up.
Why would anyone buy non Tesla car at this point? It's like betting on Nokia &amp BB when you can buy smarter iPhone
I've had amazing service from Tesla. Drove to my house twice now
VW is literally shitting themselves, Tesla makes a model 3 three times faster than VW can make an ID.3 ... THREE TIMES FASTER, Tesla‚Äôs been producing cars for a fraction of the time and has been demolishing competitors.
Ford and GM aren't better. But the Tesla charging network is better.
Wow 240k new customers are going to learn about Tesla Customer Service and how Tesla Service Centers work. Thats awesome!
Pretty much every car manufacturer has declining sales by 10-20%, but not Tesla, they just sell more and more every quarter
Surely is!!!! Even better than bull case estimate! I hope I can buy Tesla someday in the future!
A lot of what you mentioned is respectively inaccurate. Yes, they don't make most of their own batteries, but Tesla engineers were the ones who figured out how to fix the thermal issues of heat in battery packs by assembly. That feat alone could have a book written on it. There's plenty of research out there that shows how they have improved on battery design you can easily find. Their factories are some of, if not, the most advanced in the world in decreasing build margins and increasing profits on something 100 year old legacy auto has never achieved. Their vertical integration and reliance on local supplies has effectively cut corners that, again, legacy auto has failed to achieve, not because they couldn't, but because they chose not to take risks. The casting machines from IDRA have redefined how one can build parts for vehicles and go from 5,000+ in a Nissan Altima down to about 1,500-2,000 parts in an EV. We're talking about removing hundreds of steps in the manufacturing process that saves millions of dollars of a short period of time.Sandy Munroe highlights other non-tangible characteristics of Tesla in how they receive and re-innovate critiques in their builds, something that he said at his time working for Ford and other auto manufacturers would put to the way side if ever given good advice on making something better.Sure, there's certainly a lot of over hype in their valuation, no disagreements there, but this is simply numerous different types of technology all converging into one area that no other companies have really seen before. That alone is a story that people are getting behind and supporting.
Do Tesla üòÅ
To be fair, Tesla is diversifying into other areas like infrastructure, solar, insurance, software, taxi, battery tech etc.At this point I honestly think it's too simplistic to view Tesla as a car manufacturer
Ironically, there's very little lithium in a li-ion battery, and very little neodymium in a neodymium magnet.52kWh Tesla model 3 battery has a bit over 4kg of lithium inside, out of a total weight of 324kg for the whole assembly.Similarly, most of the weight of a PM motor is copper, followed by aluminium, iron, nickel and so on, with just trace amounts of actual neodymium.Yes, recycling is a good thing. But this one might not be so profitable for a while. Reusing older packs for gris stabilisation might be the best way, as reuse is above recycle on the way to green
This is an hot field. The engineers at Tesla and Rivian are top notch.Top engineers don't always result in top products though. There's some X-factors: team chemistry, one bad manager can ruin a team, mentorship.
Yea tesla is massively overvalued I love elon and his ideas but there's no way tesla worth what it's valued currently
No, but he is very open about what he does.  Right now he is short on treasuries and Tesla, and long on inflation plays.
In 2019 when Tesla was worth $30 billion, they produced over 300k vehicles. Any way you look at this, Rivian is way overvalued.
I know right üòÇ what a different country the US could have been, Tesla would be bigger than all of FAANG put together
Cathie: Tesla is worth $3kAlso Cathie: *sells $250m worth of TSLA*
I'm sure a Tesla Model 3 Plaid can. They demo'ed it running Cyberpunk 2077.
How does Foxconn buying your house make your future seem brighter ? I mean this seems pretty bleak that your so desperate your renting out the garage of the house you just sold. And in no way a bullish scenario.  If Ford and Tesla can't get parts to finish their cars. RIDE is completely ficked.
Heavy doubts, tesla doesn't have the production to match those sales.
&gt Tesla will probably make that many cybertrucks next year.lol, I will be shocked -- *shocked* -- if they deliver even *one* Cybertruck next year.All I've seen so far is a single concept car.
The only problem with your point is the assumption that Ford customers will be ready to switch to EVs before Ford does. Large tracts of this country dont view Tesla positively.
Reddit casually thinking their anecdotal evidence must be true.Tesla sold 235k vehicles in 2020, their highest year ever. Ford sold 790k of just F-series trucks in 2020, a bad year for them. They sold 910k in 2018.
For the sake of argument, I think it‚Äôs silly to rule out a company as established and well off as Ford. For reference, they brought in 127 BILLION, in revenue last year. In 2018 it was 160B. In comparison Tesla brought in 31B. Ford has some catching up to do with electric cars specifically. But they‚Äôre also in a great position to pivot into that market. Considering the size of this investment, it seems like they‚Äôre serious too. This is good for EV‚Äôs no matter how you shake it and just because they‚Äôre coming in late doesn‚Äôt mean they have zero chance at dominance.
They will be adopted very well on the demand side. Investors need to realize that any decent quality, well priced EVs will have demand outpacing supply for the next 10+ years because of a variety of factors. Factors include environmental, economic, autonomous vehicles having to be EVs, supply chain constraints beyond just covid era limitations, and others. Tesla and other surviving OEMs will do well in coming years.To say that Ford is leading the transition to EVs is an obvious lie / joke.
I think this is a great opportunity for Ford, and they've been pretty genuine in going 99% all-in on electric. So I think they can compete with anything Tesla is doing. That said...they do *not* lead. The *could* lead. They *might* lead. But as of now, they ***don't*** lead.Still, I'd take Ford over GM. Ford has a strategy, GM has press releases.
Ford plans to build 160k F-series Lightnings in 2025. I don't care how many people like the vehicle, that wouldn't be enough to take over Tesla 2 years ago.
You referring to the federal tax credits for EVs that completely ran out for Tesla a few years ago? Or are you referring to SpaceX winning government contracts by saving taxpayers literally millions upon millions by providing NASA and US military with launches at a fraction of the price of the competition?
Ford and GM definitely dragged their feet, but I wouldn‚Äôt count either out yet. The F150 Lightning has massive potential to move where Tesla hasn‚Äôt so far, which is the Midwest where luxury trucks are king and Tesla is what the city folks drive.  On the other side of the fence, expect to start seeing a lot of electric hummers in Orange County, Hollywood and Malibu. If GM can get the wealthy driving them like they did with the original hummer in the 90‚Äôs, they could really put a dent in the Luxury SUV market. (Although the thought of those 1000 horsepower monsters all over the place being driven by OC housewives replacing their G-Wagons is legit terrifying)Tesla gave the car industry the kick in its ass it needed to get serious, but don‚Äôt count out the other companies yet. They‚Äôll go where the money is, pure and simple.
Tesla Model 3 is far cheaper than the lighting, how the hell is it luxury?

People who don‚Äôt think Ford F series is a big deal haven‚Äôt been in most of the country. It‚Äôs the most popular vehicle in the US. There are entire dealerships just selling them.Tesla is a luxury product
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires silent EVs to emit a noise during operation for the purpose of alerting pedestrians. As such, new Tesla vehicles have external speakers and drivers can load up to five custom sounds to choose from.Naturally, it is leading to some hilarity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ezgU8Nro0
Tesla is leading at this point in time for sure but with Ford dropping this kind of investment, with their history, their F-series trucks, I don't really care that Tesla's leading \*right now\*
It's good to see Ford making these investments, but lets not kid ourselves here haha. Tesla was the pioneer, and should get credit where credit is due.
Actually two, the 3 and the Y. Not to mention that Tesla accounts for &gt50% of all EV sales in the US.
Lead my ass. They wouldn't be making EV's if it wasn't for Tesla.
Little bit late for " Lead America‚Äôs Shift to Electric Vehicles" I think Tesla been doing that.

&gtFord to Lead America's Shift to Electric Vehicles I'm pretty sure that should say Tesla, not Ford.
What I was thinking, Tesla is leading, Ford, naah they sat idle for too long to be considered leading. Still, bodes well in general. That said $F seldom moves any direction other than sideways.
&gtFord to lead  &gt  &gtbegin in 2025  &gt  &gtTesla and GM existhmmm
This seems too late to be fair. This wont be ready until 2025. By then Tesla (the only competition that matters) will have Texas, Berlin, Shangai firing at all cylinders and completely ramp up production and that doesn't consider that Tesla can still build 1 or 2 more Gigafactories that will ramp up by 2025 as well.This feels more like Ford playing the investors to try to get in fresh capital, since they are going to need massive amounts of capital in the next few years. This type of move had to be made in 2015/6 at this point it feels legacy OEMs are just in a dance trying to suck up as much money from the capital markets as they can by announcing big EV investments to avoid being the first OEM that will bite the dust in this transitionary time.
Tesla is already a 780 billion dollar market cap company. Less runway left for the stock price to double over and over again like it has up until now because now the laws of physics are bearing down on it. He is smart to re-allocate to higher growth potential names.
he didnt buy it he saved it, tesla was going to die without his investment. and he saved it many times over also.
Can't believe the creator of Tesla sold an $800bn company for $6mil! what a deal
&gtChamath Palihapitiya revealed that he sold his Tesla position for capital to invest in other investment ideas.Translation: He will gonna pump and dump another stock
That means Tesla going to the moon just like virgin galactic went to the moon after he sold his position in it
Tesla setting up for a major climb
i should've took profit on my tesla calls on monday im so fucking dumb
&gtBasically you‚Äôve picked successful companies and then said ‚Äúlook these outperform.‚ÄùYeah, anyone can be like "Look TESLA is such a powerful brand and it easily outperformed the market over the last 10 years." But 10 years ago Tesla was barely known at all and they didn't even mass-produce cars yet. Hindsight is 20/20
as a general rule, one would not put money in the stock market if you need to use that money soon (i.e. a few years).  So you were following the general advice.  And one absolute rule is that no one can time the market (stock market or housing market).  Never look at the past and say "I shoulda done ...".     Hell, you could have bought Tesla, Amazon, and bit coin,   etc.     Think of looking back at history with the example of "if only I had picked last week's lottery numbers!".  Of course that is silly, it is impossible to know what the lottery numbers were going to be, just like it was impossible to know what the stock market and housing markets were going to be.   'hard to see, future is'.Having said that,  you can look at various "balanced funds" and "target date" funds, which reduce risk and invest in various bonds etc.  Returns are probably quite low, but so is risk.  There are many different investment vehicles you can put some money in, precious metals, real estate, corporate bonds, government bonds, etc.   Also, you can take a small portion of your money (say 5% of it) and put that in one of these.   I don't know what the best high yield savings accounts or money markets are these days, but you might be able to search and find some good (short term) deals if you open a new account somewhere.

The biggest crash since dot.com bubble would be michael burry‚Äôs portfolio trying to short tesla and going complete bankruptcy
As of March, analysts were projecting Tesla to generate $2 billion in cash flow in 2021 and $42 billion by 2030.By utilizing the discounted cash flow valuation method, Root calculated that each 1% rise in interest rates today would hurt Tesla‚Äôs valuation by about $200 billion. Based on Tesla‚Äôs current $601 billion market cap, a 1% rise in interest rates would correlate to about 33% downside for Tesla‚Äôs stockBurrys Puts will print. Only a matter of time, unless TSLA dilutes the fuck out of their current shareholders and it‚Äôll still implode.
If you‚Äôre a Tesla bull, you should be rooting for Ford here. We want $F to rise to help justify $TSLA‚Äôs valuation.Calls on both.

Yeah, right? Before I make a car purchase I call my insurance guy and have him run numbers. Tesla Model 3 lease payment fits into my budget, but the insurance quote was almost double what he gave me for an Audi Q5 which had a similar lease payment.
Correct. You can‚Äôt compare lucid 2026 revenue to Tesla 2021/2020 revenue valuation.  Tesla 2026 revenue is probably 4.3 trillion revenue after SexBot 3.0 is released.
Tesla has a bad habbit of slapping 800 then dropping back to 600 then back to 800

Why sell it after a few years and buy another one? Why not just keep it until it really needs to be replaced?  Just curious to hear your thoughts - I'm also considering buying a Tesla but I would try to plan to keep it for as long as I could.
Imagine buying based on current profit after Amazon and Tesla existing
"Why are we poor, Dad?""Because your stupid fucking grandfather shorted tesla during the biggest bull run in history."~ My grandson and son, probably.
Depends on what the EV market looks like at that time.  Might be another Tesla or might be something else.
The battery and suspension are not going to last 500k and above. Tesla are only immune from engine/transmission type maintenance. I know that the people that say Tesla are magically maintenance free just because they have no ICE and associated transmission are either myopic or crazy.
What are you moving on to after selling your Tesla?
Lifestyle inflation is a choice.  Replacing a car when it has died is not.  With the prices so insane right now it's just a matter of minimizing your pain.  Personally I bought a Tesla because they have incredibly low depreciation.  I will drive this car for 2-3 years, sell it for not much less than I paid for it and move on.Right now there is no end in sight to the chip/car shortage so holding out is not a good strategy.Normally in your shoes a lease would be a great option just to "weather the storm" but none of the base model or cheap cars are available for leasing.  I was looking into leasing a base Subaru Outback for my wife and when I looked, pre-covid, there were 80 of them in my zipcode.  Today there are none.  Only the premium etc. models.
&gt Widening power shortages in China have halted production at numerous factories including many supplying Apple and Tesla, while some shops in the northeast operated by candlelight and malls shut early as the economic toll of the squeeze mounted.Somebody get these fuckers some more candles so they can get back to work
It would only turn into lifestyle creep if you let it. View the vehicle purchase as a necessity and a tool to get from Point A to Point B. It only really turns into lifestyle creep when you start looking at the 'luxury' brands like Tesla (overpriced tech), Lexus (Toyota), Genesis (Hyundai), Infiniti (Nissan), Acura (Honda), and BMW/Audi/Volkswagen/Mercedes (overpriced German) to name a few just because you can afford it.
Wow according to local sources, Tesla Giga Shanghai is already producing 1,600 dicks into ber esshole, a significant increase from last month. TSLA $1k EOY

When ~~Lambo~~ ~~Tesla~~ Honda?
Tesla is literally giving us the answers to the quiz. Solid bet: buy slightly OTM end Oct/early Nov calls and sell right before earnings. Less upside: sell ATM puts.
So, someone came up with the idea that if all of us tards started pre-ordering Tesla cars, it would inflate TSLA's future revenue growth projection a lot and we all could benefit from buying calls before the earnings report. Later, we could just cancel our orders.
Oh.  I totally forgot about buying that Tesla
Wait what happened with Tesla?

Lmao, he is right tho.Don't bet against Tesla at the worst time to bet against Tesla.
Tesla is hiring!
Pfft, stupid Michael Burry. He thinks that Tesla is overvalued just because it has a 403 P/E ratio? Has he not heard of the efficient market hypothesis? If Tesla wasn't worth that, it wouldn't be worth that. That's future growth, baby! It's priced in!
This reminds me of WSB-ers downloading the TESLA app and fake ordering cars en masse last year. This might actually not go tits up!
He could have picked many other companies, but he picked Tesla. Genuine retardation. His puts are going to be destroyed by Q3 results.

RIPYou bet against Tesla at the absolute worst time to bet against Tesla in monthsImpeccable /*Italian chef kiss*
Not smart.Recent info from Tesla is their 4680 production is moving along nicely... No clue if you understand what that means, but might be more likely we see a move to $1,000+ soon.
Tesla will be the worlds biggest company within the next 5 years mark my words.üöÄ

Here‚Äôs hoping next week Elon announces that Tesla will be making gas powered cars from now on
Ohh shit lol thanks for the clarification. I didn‚Äôt even consider that. Why would you buy these many puts for Tesla.
Hearing it took you years to properly take profits is comforting. I‚Äôve been trading for a little over 8 months and I struggle with selling when it‚Äôs green I only close when it‚Äôs red. I bought 770 call for Tesla on Thursday and I sold at 760 for a loss of $20. If I held til 3 PM I would have made $300 instead of losing $20. Other than listening to satan when he says bad things to me what can I do better?
I‚Äôve thought about it but honestly I don‚Äôt see the point of quitting my day job since I can sell these literally every Monday morning while hiding in the washroom on my phone LOL. I sell deep OTM ( like 15-20% away from current stock price ) and have only had to buy back 4 times out of almost 40 weeks. ( back in may when Tesla dropped hard )

Can‚Äôt go tits up. Every time there‚Äôs a bad news on a good stock they always blow things out of proportion. Look at every good stock ever, chipotle comes most prominently to mind, with the series of diarrhea related news. Same thing with Facebook (can they monetize on ads as world browses on mobile), Netflix (competition from everyone going streaming), Apple (Steve jobs dead, revenue reliance on iPhones as innovation slows) and Tesla (production hell). Markets always underestimate the ability of a seriously good company to dig them out of troubles. I suppose one could look at Sears and blockbuster and ask how they failed but those are not comparable.
You lost me at tesla is the cheapest car to own
2.5% of cars sold were electric last year. In 10 years it will be 70+%.  Tesla adds a new unit of capacity for 4500$/ car. Every incremental car they sold in Q2 added 30,000$ to their PROFIT. They are almost finished building 2 new factories each designed to produce 4x more cars than their existing 2 factories. The capex per unit of capacity at their new factories is way less than 4500$ per car. Even though they are a car manufacturer with huge factories their depreciation and amortization expense is less than amazon's  normalized to EBIT e.g. EBITDA/EBIT (Amazon builds basically nothing).Guaranteed increase in production of 4x in the next two years with apple level profit margins. It's a fucking no brainer, even if you don't consider their AI products.
Because they continue to execute and consistently beat, improve margins, and expand.  It's still early innings for Tesla
I've made like 60k this year selling Tesla puts to people
Thanks to Elon I actually have a positive net worth even when you take my mortgage into account. If Tesla becomes a multi-trillion dollar company like AAPL or MSFT, I'll be a multimillionaire.

Ok so your short just based off of current valuations. Ok why not short Tesla and Amazon too. They are over valued as well, remember I am not knocking you I‚Äôm just trying to pick your brain. I don‚Äôt get to chat with traders on the opposition much. I am long GME for the reasons mention above and I believe in them long term just for transparency
&gtWho‚Äôs betting heavily on electric vehicles?NIO, Xpeng, and Li were worth more than the US‚Äô big 3 in 2020.  Nikola was a top 10 largest automaker by market cap.  Tesla is the largest automaker in the world by a huge margin.  QS was a $40b research project.Who isn‚Äôt?
&gtRight now today a BRAND NEW Tesla Model 3 is about the cheapest car on the road to own&amp#x200Bonly if you dont understand how numbers work.
Ok, maybe not, but OP‚Äôs argument is that the Tesla 3 is the cheapest car on the road for what you get.  I maintain it is a luxury vehicle, that few can afford for what it delivers. Comparisons to the BMW 535 would support that.There is nothing wrong with a business making luxury goods and people choosing them.  Pretending they are made for the Everyman and people should buy them as they are easily affordable is a different conversation.
I was gonna say tesla FUCKED him too. But yeah
I definitely look at them as a rich kids toy still.  The price of a Tesla 3, without any EV rebate is at minimum at least 50%(if not 100%) more than its main comparable cars like a Toyota Corolla which can be purchased for about 20-25k.  Granted that is the upfront cost, and there are some minor gasoline and maintenance savings over the life, but not nearly enough discounted back to make it vastly cheaper.I‚Äôd prefer you edit your post with these calculations you are doing ‚Äúshowing‚Äù this so we can have a better conversation about those assumptions you are making, and what‚Äôs driving them.
Lol. Shorting Tesla. Retard belongs here
You bought Tesla puts ? üòÇ
Hahahah you bought puts on Tesla
Looks like Tesla said fuck you too!
Nah fuck u for not knowing not to short tesla , the og short killer
It should be noted that this strategy would leave you missing out big time if it ever does squeeze like Tesla. OP will know this but be aware if you plan on using this method.
Unfortunately tesla chargers do not its always a mess in some poor trees corner.
If Tesla closes below 755 tomorrow, I will send someone $25 whoever likes and comments on this post
Ay listen dipshits at 3k Tesla would be the most valuable company in the world valued over 3T dollars.
 It's a real car. And I think it reaches a younger demo that wants to go ev but can't afford a Tesla or Revian. First sale end of 2022, maybe? So for this crowd it's considered a long term investment
If tesla pumps again tomorrow.....I may never financially recover.
Was the tesla parked?
I have a golden ring showing a Tesla logo impaling a bear into the ground. You can imagine where all my money is. My dad thinks I‚Äôm nuts but the numbers speak for themselves.
I was just looking at Canoo vehicles comparing them to a cybertruck with cyberlandr for camping. Not for me, but their videos were really impressive for me for them as a company, which I dont normally think about when shopping around. Didnt even know they were listed. They really thought through the designs in a way that will have broader appeal than Tesla. I think you're onto something.
Lucid ran a bull run up to \~$60 as a SPAC. Then GME came out and a lot of big players started reducing their positions in a lot of WSB bull stocks. This thing fell to an average of around $23 for almost the whole year. A lot of haters and bears of this stock said the cars wouldn't be made for years and that this was only a good long term play (around 2023). However this bull run got started because they got their battery certified (and it's better than they thought, longer range than Tesla) and then it was announced that they had secured 10,000 VINs (Vehicle Identification Numbers) which means they are close to production. Thus the run-up. The gamble on this stock is whether this stock will produce cars this year. Bears say no and Bulls say yes. This company has not broken $30 (it got close a couple times) since it's initial bull run as a SPAC when everyone wasn't sure if this company would make a car this year or in the next couple of years. Now that there is a good sign they will I'm guessing that over $30 is possible.Additionally this is a new company with no product so bulls are also betting on this becoming a big company in the future and these are ground floor prices. Bears think that this company will be garbage because Tesla owns the market place. I'm a bull and I think the market is looking for a number 2 in the EV space.
Anyone on the verge of midlife crisis and which Tesla are you getting
On the 29th of June 2010 Tesla was only $17 a share. Tesla's former chief engineer has joined Lucid. EV sales are soaring so I think I might risk buying a few then sit back and dream.
Former Apple and Tesla people, using Tesla‚Äôs growth model while benefitting from learning from *Tesla‚Äôs* mistakes, with an actual car proven to beat Tesla‚Äôs range (for now) that they‚Äôre putting a nicer interior in for the people that spend 100K on a car.
Tesla owners are the Vegans of the car world. Prove me wrong.
Agreed. lucid is the poor man‚Äôs Tesla.
It‚Äôs too late to buy Tesla if you poor like me. To fix that I‚Äôm buying lucid.
Tesla bulls: If these calls work out, I'm buying a Tesla!Lucid bulls: If these calls work out, I'm buying a Honda!
LCID‚Äôs cars look better and have 110 miles more range than Tesla. Stock is on fire
LCID and TESLA are incredibly different stocks
LCID has been a pump for a while. People forget tesla didn't pop for many years.
They gave registered VIN's fire 2022 which means they are producing cars, and delivery is coming this year. Expect to see 10k cars delivered this year from Lucid.... They can go the distance with Tesla!!! Pun intended for the 520 mile EPA rating they just received....ü§£
Was considering buying a brand new Tesla model Y, but with how much money i have lost these past weeks i will have to consider selling even my 20 year old Toyota and just ride my bike
it's so sad 99% of users on here are Tesla bulls and can't accept the fact that lucid tech is better and may or may not be the only real competitor in few years.
I'm not going to pretend to know the asian high end sportscar market, but any 6 year old vehicle with only 18,000 miles on it should do very well at a vehicle auction.  It's at least worth looking into an appraisal and or discussions with enthusiasts.  Could probably fairly easily sell it off and get the Tesla and still have extra cash.
Spy to 150 finally Let's destroy the financial markets so we can all buy Tesla for cheap again
Not that great of a story to tell actually. Buddy and I made some money off of a company that was sold. We work in Asia where cars are stupid expensive. He bought a mclaren and I bought a 911. We both regretted it almost immediately. He took the l and sold his within a year. I‚Äôm going to drive mine until it falls apart. The only problem is that my daily commute to work is 8 minutes round trip. I‚Äôve had the car for 6 years now and it‚Äôs only got 18000 miles on it. Really should have bought a Tesla but I don‚Äôt think the 3 was out at the time.
With the gas prices going higher and higher, a Tesla with their free charging stations just starts to look better and better.
Let's not pretend we aren't all part of the cycle.  Your neighbor with the Tesla could very well be sitting on investments 10x yours.
South Africa? I didn't know Tesla made armored cars!
Love Tesla.  Not sure about fb long term
I lost like 50k on Tesla and AMD options Lmaoo mind you I went from 5k to 50k back to 0
The ‚Äúscam‚Äù is you can get a better or comparable system for less and still pay little to nothing out of pocket. When I hear zero percent financing, I am really hearing don‚Äôt worry we already padded our profit into the price of the package. Instead you should find a more competitive bid and then figure out your financing, as others may have already suggested for example, a HELOC (home equity line of credit).In my previous comment regarding my system. Even at a reasonable interest rate, if I had financed, say 3.5 percent. My $16k 8.16kW system would still only cost $25k after a 25 year loan term.Tesla charges roughly $12k for a 13kW battery. So out of your $48k quote, they‚Äôre charging you at least $33k for the solar alone, over twice what I paid for a 8.16kW sized system and still $8k more what I would pay if I financed my system at reasonable terms.They‚Äôre taking you to the bank of this deal.
Lmao wtf r you talking about? When Tesla lowered the prices of their cars in China, there were weeks of protest because no one saw it coming, especially the people who signed the day before
My opinion is nothing.  Bank of America gives LCID a $30 PT and calls it a combination of Tesla and Ferrari.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lucid-is-a-combo-of-tesla-and-ferrari-bof-a-analyst-202738043.htmlEdit: Unbelievable that this is getting downvoted with snide comments.  You think Bank of America analysts don't do fundamental analysis to arrive at their price targets?
20% more range for 200% the cost of a Tesla. Great news.
&gt If tesla has pivoted from their expensive luxury models to the cheap 3 there is a reason ( even before chip issues )That's kinda a dumb assessment. Tesla started with "Luxury" cars because you have to do so. High margin at first then you streamline your production to be able to produce low margin cheap cars. And Tesla always sucked on the quality control. Lucid's CEO was the Chief Engineer behind Tesla's cars (Model S daddy's) and he was previously working for Jaguar and Lotus. More than Musk, he knows how to make cars, he knows how to make good cars. And now he has the EV with the longest range ever produced.Biggest issue for this stock is to be already valued at 30~40billions while no car has been released yet. But it is the case for all the EV companies right now.
If tesla has pivoted from their expensive luxury models to the cheap 3 there is a reason ( even before chip issues ) Lucid is charging wayyyyy too much for nothing special . 100-150k you get the plaid or  the porsche EV Full disclosure I have a tesla but can admit they are built so poorly. When I‚Äôm ready for luxury I‚Äôll be getting that porsche or maybe a german brand if they release Something nice
So the key to wealth is not Tesla FDs?
Hold the EVs, CCP will subsidise them with money and stolen tesla technology. They want EVs to take off so they can lessen their dependence on oil imports in case they go to war over Taiwan and lose the naval war.
because it costs acceleration, tires, suspension, safety, stopping distance, handling, and floor space. ohh, and it limits the total number of vehicles you can produce because everyone is cell-limited.Lucid is the most retarded bet. their car is going to perform worse than Tesla plaid in every way, except range, and cost more. their fancy super-powerful motor is going to get nerfed for reliability reasons. not only that, if they do somehow magically produce a better car than Tesla, Porsche, and Ford, they can't scale fast enough to take advantage of their lead. Tesla will just put carbon-wrapped motors in their 3 and Y, and beat Lucid's performance at half the price. don't even get me started on autopilot driving assist...

Tesla isn‚Äôt even close to theirs by 10s of miles.  Why did my 6 month old M3 just drop 5 miles on max range after a SW update?Please.
He shorted Tesla and won on the trade
The huge growth companies at the top are always going to be the ones that do the most damage to people's portfolio if there is indeed a bubble because most investors are in those companies, hence their high prices.https://youtu.be/kfMFDcuDKYA?t=76Note how none of these companies are bullshit dotcom hype companies and most of them are not even tech companies. They almost all ate shit when the bubble burst. General Electric lost like half its market cap in a year. Walmart, Exxon and Pfizer took a huge hit.Now, go down the list of S&ampP 500 companies and look at the price to sales ratios. These companies are roughly 30% of the S&ampP. | Company | P/S || ----- | ----- || Apple | 7.16 || Microsoft | 13.81 || Amazon | 15.33 | | Facebook | 10.29 || Google | 8.73 || Berkshire Hathaway | 1.76 || Tesla | 20.58 || Nvidia | 25.29 || JP Morgan | 4.01 || Johnson and Johnson | 4.94 |Look at this bullshit: https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales They were looking a bit high before the pandemic, and during the pandemic they went from high to fucking nuts. "Normal" numbers are between 1 and 2 and all the companies at the top are from like 7 to 25.Price to book has all kinds of problems but it's hard for me to hand wave away such a massive increase in such a short time. Corporate debt is eventually going to matter. https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-bookHigh P/S makes sense when pricing in growth, but how many of these companies actually going to have that growth? With the exception of Tesla, these are pretty mature companies with growing revenue. But they're priced for a *lot* of growth, not *some* growth. If that growth narrative ends up being overblown, future revenue expectations will drop, the net present value will drop, and the prices will decline and most investors will see large losses because most investors are in these companies, hence their high prices.Some of these companies have PE ratios above 60. Again, high PE ratio makes sense when pricing in growth, but these companies are already at the top of the S&ampP.
You wanna see a bunch of EBoiz and Egurlz tryin to shoot off assault rifles at Tesla robocops in 25 years? In like a non-porn way?
As much as people love to shit on Tesla. Lucid never, ever, ever will have to go through the struggle Tesla did. To completely alter the world's thoughts on EVs. To have people short the company, to a massive Gear head televised show fake the car breaking down and so forth.Then Lucid just waltz in, "oh hey, we just started an EV company too."  No one putting them down.Thats why I will always be a Tesla fanboy, but more EV companies means better transition to green energy. But just remember, without Tesla, we wouldn't be here, in this position, at all!
Tesla didn‚Äôt have its first ‚Äúfull year‚Äù of profit until this year. It‚Äôs first profitable quarter was in 2013. But Tesla‚Äôs stock didn‚Äôt start to rocket until end of 2019.
I honestly think lucid will have more gains per dollar invested than Tesla, moving forwards for some time.
Yep, Elon has an ego.  Btw, Tesla has moved on. The model 3 and Y far far outgross the Model S. The Model S and X could disappear tomorrow and it would hardly affect Tesla. I wish Lucid all the best, but a $130K car won‚Äôt be selling in very high volumes. Just like Tesla, they will will need to go downmarket to grow.
‚ÄúFake it till you make it‚Äù is the bedrock of Silicon Valley. Some make it, many don‚Äôt. Elon has created an industry and we will find out what Tesla‚Äôs long term future is in that industry in the next five years. Looking at them objectively, Tesla has a sizable lead in terms of market share and deployed infrastructure, including charging and service. When it comes to tech, time has been wasted adding worthless features to their vehicles and they have yet to deliver on a list of core commitments and promises. There is no debate that they have an amazing product but in it‚Äôs current state it isn‚Äôt as far out of reach from other EV companies as many seem to assume. Competition will be focusing for Tesla. They are an amazing American brand and I sincerely hope they step up, but it isn‚Äôt a foregone conclusion. They are about 2% of new vehicle sales in the US. This story is still being written.Peter appears to be doing great work at Lucid. They too will be part of the story. Musk appears partly focused on Rawlinson. Rawlinson is 100% focused on Lucid.
 But I don‚Äôt understand. Tesla is the only stock there that could make those 10x gains. The rest didn‚Äôt go up as much
So is cathie wood lmao. She put a bear case of like 3k a share on Tesla and started selling the following week
Picking out my Tesla for when this hits $80 tomorrow
By the time the car hits their showroom, Tesla will have released a 1000 mile range car.
HODLMy genius friend who thought TESLA was a bad buy 3 years ago thinks that IRNT will crumble down to $25 today.That means IRNT will go to AT least $50 today then moon later.
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. ‚Äî A SpaceX rocket lifted off on Wednesday night from a launchpad here, carrying four Americans on an adventure to orbit the Earth for three days that will be like no other.None of the crew works for NASA. The mission, known as Inspiration4, is the first orbital trip where not one of the people aboard is a professional astronaut and where government is, by and large, a bystander and observer.The evening sky was nearly devoid of clouds when the nine engines of the Falcon 9 rocket ignited, lifting the rocket and its passengers to space.Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire and founder of Shift4, a payments processing service, financed the trip. As the mission‚Äôs commander, he thanked those who made it possible, and said that it had brought him and the crew, to the ‚Äúdoor step of an exciting and unexplored frontier.‚Äù‚ÄúA few have come before but many are about to follow,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe door is opening now, and it‚Äôs pretty incredible.‚ÄùJared Isaacman, left, and Hayley Arceneaux before the launch on Wednesday.Jared Isaacman, left, and Hayley Arceneaux before the launch on Wednesday.John Raoux/Associated PressMr. Isaacman‚Äôs public profile is far less prominent than that of Richard Branson or Jeff Bezos, two billionaires who flew to the edge of space in July in vehicles operated by companies they own. Those trips lasted just minutes before returning to the ground.But Mr. Isaacman‚Äôs three-day adventure is perhaps more noteworthy, a step toward a future where space travel might be like airline travel today ‚Äî accessible by almost everyone.That is because Mr. Isaacman decided not to just bring along his friends on this trip to space. Instead, he opened opportunities to three people he did not know.‚ÄúWe set out from the start to deliver a very inspiring message,‚Äù Mr. Isaacman said during a news conference on Tuesday, ‚Äúand chose to do that through an interesting crew selection process.‚ÄùThe result is a mission that carries a crew that is more representative of wider society ‚Äî Hayley Arceneaux, a 29-year-old physician assistant at St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital in Memphis Sian Proctor, a 51-year-old community college professor who would be the first Black woman to pilot a spacecraft and Christopher Sembroski, a 42-year-old data engineer.Mr. Isaacman has declined to say how much he is paying for this orbital trip, only that it was less than the $200 million that he hopes to raise for St. Jude with an accompanying fund-raising drive, one of the stated purposes of the trip.During a news conference the day before the launch, the crew members expressed their excitement and said they were not feeling jitters.Ms. Arceneaux‚Äôs Instagram profile included images from Kennedy Space Center. In one post, she posed before the Falcon 9 rocket with her mother, brother and sister-in-law. Another, which was taken from the launch tower, included the caption, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs ready, we‚Äôre ready.‚ÄùDr. Proctor posted a portrait of herself in her custom SpaceX spacesuit, proclaiming herself ‚ÄúFlight Ready!‚ÄùOn Twitter, Mr. Isaacman responded to some of his followers late into the night with details about the trip. In response to a CNBC reporter‚Äôs question about the potential for a delayed return to Earth because of weather or other factors, he said they would be able to stay in space for ‚Äúabout a week.‚ÄùCinemagraphBy Spacex Via Associated PressLate on Wednesday afternoon, a live video streamed on the internet showing the astronauts donning their spacesuits at a SpaceX building near the launchpad. That is a change from the NASA center used by NASA astronauts, and reflects the shift from a mission serving government to one focused on private enterprise.The astronauts then took a short ride in Tesla S.U.V.s to the launchpad about three hours before liftoff. They ascended via elevator to the top of the launch tower, 255 feet up, and crossed a bridge to the Crew Dragon capsule. They paused, beaming with wide smiles, to take in the view. They signed the wall of what is called the ‚Äúwhite room,‚Äù a space just outside the capsule door.Technicians then sealed them into the spacecraft. Two and half hours before launch, they were all strapped in and performing checks of the communication system. Then there was a long wait before the rocket was to be filled with propellant, 35 minutes before liftoff.Sarah Gillis, the lead space operations engineer for SpaceX who guided the crew to orbit from mission control, wished them good luck and a godspeed.‚ÄúIt has been an absolute honor to prepare you for this historic flight,‚Äù she said.Once the flight launched, the crew‚Äôs enthusiasm was unbowed by the forces pressing down on them, as a video inside the capsule showed Dr. Proctor and Mr. Sembroski fist-bumping.CinemagraphBy Spacex Via Associated PressThe capsule then headed to an orbit some 360 miles up, higher than the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope. Indeed, the Inspiration4 crew will be farther from Earth than anyone else since the end of the Apollo moon missions in the 1970s.The Inspiration4 crew members will spend a fair amount of their time in orbit helping to advance medical research on how the human body reacts to being in space.Other activities will be more fun. Dr. Proctor, for instance, will be making some artwork.‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to bring paint and do some art in space, and thinking about just the fluids and the dynamics of watercolors,‚Äù she said on Tuesday.Mr. Sembroski took a ukulele with him and is planning to play and sing in the Crew Dragon.‚ÄúI apologize for any ears that are listening intently, but I‚Äôll give it my best shot,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I do know the acoustics are pretty good.‚ÄùThe payload also includes items that are being auctioned to raise money for St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Center, which treats children at no charge and develops cures for childhood cancers as well as other diseases. (Ms. Arceneaux was a patient at the hospital as a child, before returning to work there as an adult.)After they get to orbit, they will circle the planet, 15 trips around the planet each day, until Saturday, when they are scheduled to return to Earth, splashing down off the Florida coast.
You didn‚Äôt hear this from me. But Tesla is announcing a stock split on market close on October 8. Look at the options chain for  October 22‚Ä¶ particularly the 900+ contracts. üòâ
Should have named her ‚ÄúTesla‚Äù
Looks like I‚Äôm paying cash for my Tesla I‚Äôm picking up next Monday. Woohoo!
3 years ago, I was thinking about YOLO-ing my $20K inheritance into TESLA. That was before the stock split. I can't remember the exact amount, but it was around $250/share.I let one of my accounting friends talk me out of it, because he said TESLA had terrible numbers and would go bankrupt in 5 years, and would crumble down to $80/share before bankruptcy. I have never felt more retarded. That's why I am just going with my instincts now with IRNT, despite what this same friend has said about IRNT. TO THE MOON
Good write up albeit a bit long. Dissecting Adam‚Äôs views on Tesla and Lucid is helpful. Keep it up!
I think it's a pretty well written DD. Opinionated to lean towards LCID but well written. I don't think we can call them anything since they haven't released a car yet...Can't compare to others that have a product so all of the tesla/rivian/etc. comparisons mean nothing at this point. However, isn't the point of investing to get in early? I'm not sure why people are bitching that they have 0 cars or products. That's why their stock is at $20. I think it's a good risk considering the upside.
How did you not offload these when Tesla was $880?
Fuck Adam Jonas!  LCID I love this stock and car. Tesla is King but LCID can be the Prince.
In February/March of 2020 I was crushing it, I couldn't lose. I was getting cocky, taking risks I knew I shouldn't, but they were paying off. I made just under $2000 on a WAY otm tesla call in 2 hours. I knew the gravy train would come to a stop at some point, so I pulled everything out and was gonna sit on it for a month or so, just observe. I came on this thread and commented something along the lines of "going cash gang for a while" and someone replied with a cat emoji. Well I'm no pussy, so I went balls deep in qqq calls. Within hours the coronavirus recession hit. I blew up my entire account catching falling knives. And that's the story of how I lost all of my money because of a cat emoji.
Apple, Microsoft, Google, now Amazon have seen the original people move on and the companies do fine. Tesla might not be there yet, but one day soon.
Plus $500 US made, 8k for Tesla and Oonly $9000 for the Mexican made Mach-E!‚Ä¶..
She kept 99.5% of her shares after a decent run up at the beginning of a breakout and this üåàüêª thinks it‚Äôs a bearish sign...How retarded can TSLA bears be? The P/E ratio is going to be sub 100 very soon and Tesla is already more profits than Ford at the beginning of their S growth curve.
Post a Tesla short position if your so confident. So we can laugh as you burn üî• üî• üî•
Buy Tesla and never sell.
I love when people cite her selling. They don't understand that her funds have a 10% max on a position. She is always selling Tesla on run ups as a result. OP is just a silly fella.
Burry been yelling sky is falling for years. Broken clock right twice a day and he was right a decade ago, been riding that since. Kathy HAD to sell Tesla due to her fund‚Äôs rules of not being able to hold more than 10% or so of any stock. The fact that she is in TSLA that much that the rule applies is actually the most bullish position she can have. Post not well researched. 0 stars.
Your mistake is you think the bull case for many investors relies on the points or timeline you are making. The robot is something that no serious investor thinks will be relevant for a decade or more (the market cap such a robot would add to TSLA might be tens of trillions... this is way beyond my conception at this time... on the other hand, too far out and risky to invest much based on this). FSD, there are varying opinions but anyone that seriously follows Tesla would know that DOJO will take at least a year to be running properly and then from there add some time for FSD to improve and then be validated. You are perhaps talking 3+ years out. Regardless it does not matter if FSD is ready in 2 years or 5 years or later, what matters is what approach to the problem do you believe is the best, because regardless of when it is solved being the one with the best approach will result in a multi-trillion dollar valuation for FSD alone (oh, wait, TSLA market cap is 740B... it clearly only reflects a bet on FSD and does not assume it is a certainty).How about consider things like their innovations in manufacturing, especially the massive step-changes that they are in middle of right now. Their large castings are one example and are still a year or two out before it is implemented in every vehicle they make. Their work on 4680 cells, which seems to be moving closer to commercialization, is another massive step-change that will further cut their costs of building cars and allow them to make better cars for cheaper (years before anyone can volume produce solid-state batteries). Maybe, don't be aghast, but try to follow what the Cybertruck is beyond just an unusual looking pickup truck (with great specs at better prices than anyone else suggests... although a year or so out from production). The design of the truck is revolutionary as it is not just body on frame. For an EV that is huge. Also such a truck to be economically produced would probably be impossible without new manufacturing processes (single casts, sheet metal being bent, being an EV giving flexibility to the design that ICE does not allow and so on). The problem too many TSLA bears have, is they focus on how much they dislike the design and ignore that the design fundamentally represents a next-gen approach to making pickup trucks. Legacy pickup truck designs you might find out are fundamentally inferior. I suspect that does not end up well for everyone  else.But yeah, limit the bull case to TSLA to points that the bulls themselves don't really invest based on.
Buying tesla

So all in to Tesla?
This. Sometimes to be able to say ‚ÄúI wish I bought into Tesla/SQ/Etc pre revenue when it was cheap‚Äù, you have to buy in times like these. The IP is there, Microsoft literally couldn‚Äôt do it alone with all those billions and thousands of high talent. MVIS uses their Gen 4 mems in the HL2, WHICH is now old because the new Gen 5 mems they make is half the size. HALF! Given their expertise, the CEO shifts the company to automotive lidar, which at this moment at IAA this past week, shits on Luminar, Velodyne, etc. This company is going places.
Considering the consolidation in the market and the fact that Microvision serves 2 emerging markets (each with massive potential), I must say I have to agree with this sentiment. I always say $500+ because once the consumer market adopts these technologies, there's no limit to where the company can go as we've seen with the Apples and Microsofts of the world and hell even Tesla. I believe Microvision has that level of potential simply because the tech is legitimate and they own a huge amount of the patents needed in LBS. Exciting times ahead for sure in my opinion!
And Apple do not like Teslaü§î
Ha! I did the same thing in 2011 just because it was ‚Äúeasier to stay on top of my investment‚Äù. I got tired of having a bunch to check, and was at a shitty point in life.It wasn‚Äôt anything even close to 100K, at all. But I dumped everything into Tesla at just over $22 a share, and forgot about it. I plan to hold‚Ä¶until‚Ä¶the moon?! We‚Äôll see though. My portfolio gains today were what I originally invested. Crazy shite.Congrats on your excellent foresight and judgment!
Gotta love the confidence of someone who made a million dollars off of a lucky call and now treats a million dollars like play money. In 2020 my buddy made close to a mil playing Tesla options. He of course drank the kool aid and began to believe Tesla would continue to go up forever and ever. This year he lost everything he made last year plus he hasn't paid his taxes from last year yet. So he's down around 450k after being up a mil and refusing to walk.God speed, retard.
CLOV man what the hell are you doing? last week i was picking out my new tesla. this week i may need to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford to pay my bills
I bought 10 10/15 options at $10. I've been following you for about a week. Please continue the DD's so I can buy a Tesla soon.
I agree darock - this guy sounds like those losers who shorted TSLA back in the day and just COULDNT BELIEVE IT when Tesla didn‚Äôt die and instead wiped out a shit ton of their profits.Go back to your moms basement you fucking donkey brain.
I thought it was just a meme.  BMW drivers legit are the biggest fucking assholes on the road.Why is this??? Seriously, Lambos, Tesla, Mercedes, Porche.  All nice / expensive cars.  Don't notice any difference vs. the average dude.BMW drivers though act like if they don't viciously cut you off to remove .5 seconds off their commute, everyone will find out how small their dick is.

[Walter Bloomberg tweeted this morning](https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1436638800818720768) that house democrats are proposing new, increased tax credits for EVs, up to $12,500, including a $4,500 credit for EVs assembled in union represented factories.  Starting price for the lifestyle vehicle is [listed on Canoo's web site](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) as $34,750, not including any federal or state subsidies or incentives. Throw a big tax credit in the mix, and the Canoo vehicle offerings start looking like the affordable EV Tesla has yet to make.

Nah, but the rest of my account isn‚Äôt doing so hot. Two words: Tesla Puts‚ò†Ô∏è
But the palantir black Swan event going to send tesla to 0Jk idk what the colour of swans has to do with anything
Barring some sort of government regulation, Elon will not use lidar. Period.We know the technology works, plenty of other self driving systems are using it, but he just doesn‚Äôt like it. He referred to it as cheating, because he wants his AI to be able to ‚Äòsee‚Äô and process the road directly from a camera feed.He‚Äôs even trying to move away from the radar the cars currently use. You won‚Äôt see lidar in a Tesla anytime soon (if ever).
This stupid sub is going to make me buy Tesla calls on margin
Need Tesla +3% today
Seriously. Tesla was a squeeze. GameStop is a squeeze. Clov.... Well, let's just say it's not a squeeze
the problem is that tesla has developed a cult following. it does not matter what the number and stats say. People will keep on singing buy buy buy. Even if the stock drops to a $100 cause it became cheaper.  so even if burry is 100% spot on and inflations gives tesla a super heavy hit people would still not sell tesla. Stock prices only drop when people sell not what the company makes
/r/investing in it for the long haul into boomer ETFs and dividends stocks. Average annual returns of 5% is the holy grail. NO TESLA.______/r/dividends my second hip replacement is in 2 weeks.

Take debt out of the picture and the same principles of the time value of money still apply. Future profits are worth less than profits today. Google makes a lot of money *today.* Tesla may make a lot of money in the future. But Google making $20 billion today is worth more than Tesla making $20 billion in a decade.
His logic for shorting Tesla was sound. But market participants don't care and the stock price went up. Losing millions on a short position in Tesla and then doubling down and losing even more is not a genius act.
If Ford or GM wake up tomorrow and decides to get into the EV game, how fast with Tesla fail?-every boomer in 2016
Burry has predicted a stock market crash 12 times and it‚Äôs been right for 2 of them. Anyone buying Puts on Tesla deserves to lose their fortune
Lol that guy is a retard you can trade rates to bet on inflation. Burrys bet was on Tesla being overvalued which has been a common bet for a lot of hedge funds. Tesla was one of the most shorted stocks even before their huge rise in valuation last year.
The top rated comment about interest rates is laughable. TSLA has 20 billion in cash and effectively no debt. It also has what stops big tech from tanking for long if rates rise. Pricing power. They have already demostrated that with the several price changes and yet i cant buy a tesla till 2022 because they are all sold out. Here is the dirty little secret, rate rise affects cyclical value and commodities. They dont have the pricing power that Apple does. If an iphone costs 10% more are you gonna go buy a trash phone? Fuck no. Until Tesla comes out with a 25k car price doesnt matter. Only the rich can afford one at the moment and 5-10k is irrelevant if you actually have money. Not everyone can afford a tesla but the people who can arent sweating the price tag when a regular ass truck can cost 90k these days.
So it looks like he entered this trade for the Tesla puts in Q1.  He  has increased this position in contracts held in Q2 by about 35%.   The purchase price per contract only went up 2% in that time so his  holding was relatively flat from the end of Q1 to the end of Q2, that  is assuming he purchased the same exp and strike.  The last holdings  13F filed for Scion was 6-30 and these Tesla puts were 35.11% of  Scion's holdings (ouch), valued at 731 million dollars.  Since then,  Tesla has gone from 687 to 754.  I guess we will get an update at the  end of the month on the saga with the next filing.
In what universe do you foresee FB/GOOG, **profit making machines,** shitting the bed while Tesla continues to outperform their year-2050 performance expectations?
Reposting here: you‚Äôre missing the point of his bet.People don't see the full idea behind Michael Burry's TSLA short. Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.He doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.Let's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.It's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.So how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.TLDR:The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).

They‚Äôre already selling all of these things, important to note is all the cash they have to acquire new businesses, rumors of their own game developers have been passed around too, also shorts never closed and I‚Äôm not selling until Tesla levels of squeeze
It literally made me start trading. Sure there were idiots, but people actually had back and forth on company Financials seriously. Not this bullshit pump and only say positive shit.I got my own strategy that worked for me, that I had just started using and when I saw another person with the same strategy with a couple mil, man. There was actual decent dd and strategies posted. Not the bullshit it is now.You can't post negative shit about any meme or people think you're a hedge fund shill.Everyone shit on everyone's picks before. That was literally what you did. Hell, you think roaring kitty got received well when he posted gme? He got fucking shit on just like every post. Hell, it only took Tesla going up non stop and call options being essentially actual free money on Tesla as it rocketed to literally being one of the most valuable companies, before Tesla got SOME respite and people still shit on it.In fact a lot of people would make a bet and there would be an inverse bet soon after saying fuck that dudes dd.This was not a place to cheerlead memes and group invest. It was diverse opposing opinions. Now that that's gone, it's funny at times, but honestly quite sad.
And that stock? Tesla!!! And so began the ongoing battle of the tesla shorts vs Elon.
There's reasons to buy and hold other than fundamentals.I bought and held Tesla for years when the fundamentals didn't make it look smart, damn glad I did though.
Tesla hasn‚Äôt been profitable until recently.
I am also in, sadly I am a poor college student so I only have 11 shares at 9.91. Caught wind of them going public with VACQ before the ticker change. Rocket Labs IS the future of commercial rocket launch capabilities as well as assembly. They can produce rockets at much faster rates and iterate on their designs much faster than any other competitor due to using 3D printing for a majority of the rocket.&amp#x200BDue to their research in 3D printing at large scale and at high precision, essentially they are miles ahead of the game in terms of rapid production. I personally think that they will be the "tesla" of space, as they innovate much faster than most of the other rocket manufacturers that use traditional techniques. Using 3D printing, Rocket Labs can produce complex parts that is impossible for normal machining techniques to reproduce. This allows for engineering designs to have much lower limitations on design capabilities for complex parts of the rocket. This also means, that due to their experience and knowledge in precise metal 3D printing, they will service other industries and companies where complex design is extremely common. &amp#x200BI see RKLB as a long term hold, where the sky is not the limit. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

credit to u/aka0007  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p36ywi/ride\_why\_lordstown\_motors\_is\_headed\_to\_zero/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p36ywi/ride_why_lordstown_motors_is_headed_to_zero/)$RIDE - Why Lordstown Motors is Headed to Zero DD  I think after the last earnings call there is a lot of incorrect information or straight out distortion of facts being put out by people and analysts alike here and would like to set the record straight with what I believe the facts are.    Production:    The company in their earnings call said they are on track to start production at the end of Sep 2021. If you actually listened to what they said, they said this is for test-builds that they hope to validate in Q4 and to deliver a few to some special early customers in Q1' 2022. They further said or implied that they expect regular commercial deliveries to start in Q2' 2022. Previously, they said on the Q1' 2021 call they had enough cash to ramp production to produce and deliver 1,000 vehicles this year. Now delivery (ignoring their special test-builds delivered to early customers) is pushed back to Q2' 2022. Maybe the word PRODUCTION is being misused to imply something other than what they are doing. I would suggest the correct term for what they are doing now is PRE-PRODUCTION. In any case this is semantics as revenue requires deliveries, not production.    Equity Line of Credit (ELOC):    There have been claims that there is a "Line of Credit" providing up to $400M in financing in place. In fact this is a complete misrepresentation. Below is the link to an SEC filing describing the agreement between RIDE and YA. Here are some key points and how the $400M is computed and why it does not mean anything.    On 7/23/2021 they entered into the agreement with YA to purchase up to $400M of their Class A Common Stock over a 36 month period at RIDE's discretion (that should be a red flag there. As why would YA agree to this... well all will be explained). Per that filing, " The net proceeds that we may receive under the Purchase Agreement cannot be determined at this time...", which means that while RIDE can potentially receive up to $400M, they might receive far less but can't predict that amount, as it depends on the stock price.    The agreement says that RIDE can only sell YA, up to 35,144,690 in shares, UNLESS, (1) they obtain shareholder approval to sell more or (2) the average price they sell the shares to YA at is over $7.48 per share. The price of the shares is 3% less than the "simple average of the daily VWAP's for the three trading days following notice to YA" There are also daily limits on how many shares RIDE can sell to YA at any time.    So assuming 35M shares, at a current share price of about $5.8 that is about $204M before the 3% discount to market price that RIDE nets. For RIDE to net 400M, with selling 35M shares they need a share price of $11.4. Alternatively they need shareholders to approve selling much more than 35M shares (so just more dilution) or they need the average price to be over $7.48, which will allow them to increase the shares they sell, so also more dilution.    In sum, at current market prices they net about $200M under this "Equity Line of Credit" or share offering. However, as selling shares will likely depress the price, they should net far less.    https://sec.report/Document/0001558370-21-009222/    Further Dilution:    Per the SEC filing below, it says that Mr. Burns can sell 50% of his shares by 10/23/2021. Steve Burns owns 46.4 million shares, so assuming he sells when his shares are unlocked he can sell 23.2M shares end of Oct 2021. While in theory not "dilutive" the end of lock-ups tend to have a similar impact by flooding the market with more shares than demand for them.    https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-090313/#tSTTR    Cash Position:    Per their Q2 earnings call and reports they have about 366M in cash on hand at 6/30/2021. In their earnings report they suggested about 200M in operating expenses for the rest of 2021 and about 215M in CAPEX. While they suggested they can time some of the payments in Q3, this comes to about 415M in cash needed to get through the year. That is about 50M cash short.    Going back to their ELOC, at current share price they can raise about 200M, so assuming they raise the funds without dropping the share price that leaves them with 150M at year end. It is reasonable to assume that their quarterly cash needs will only increase as they attempt to get to production (this has been the case so far for them and has been the case by every other auto maker as far as I can tell) means that for Q1' 2022 they will need over 200M. The conclusion is obvious, that on top of the current share offering, if the share price does not go up, they must issue more shares. Further, they project regular commercial deliveries in Q2' 2022 so the money they need will not be insignificant.    Other Sources of Funds:    The Company suggested that they are getting a valuation on their plant and equipment in order to possibly borrow funds against that. They suggested that the value is much more than the book value of about $300M. The fact is, a lot of their equipment will be installed and modified to their specs and will not be suitable without additional cost to another manufacturer. This means that fire sale value, or what someone might actually lend against it, will likely be far less than the book value. Perhaps to Lordstown, the value is higher, but to a third party that is a very doubtful assumption. As to the factory itself, it was an old plant that GM shut down. This is not something people are looking to buy. For EV's, you see with Tesla, Lucid, and others they are looking or building new factories with layouts designed for EV's and not ICE vehicles. I would again doubt the factory has much value for a lender. Hard to know what they can borrow using their plant and equipment as collateral, but it clearly will not be much.    Conclusion:    Given the dilution and share unlocks coming and their downward pressure on share price, as it stands now the company will have difficult raising sufficient funds to get to production. For the company to be viable, it must have its share price go up first to enable them to raise funds favorably. As evidenced by today's price action, this company is not attracting substantial shareholder inflows, so it remains unclear how the share price increases first to enable them to raise sufficient funds. So based on the current share price, I don't understand how this company, even if they do everything right going forward, can succeed.    Some Other Thoughts:    None of the above analysis is dependent on whether the in-wheel tech works or not or is a good candidate for a commercially viable electric truck. I have for several months expressed substantial doubts about the tech and RIDE's ability to execute and have no reason to assume otherwise. In any case, even if it could work, structurally RIDE is not in a position anymore to commercialize it.    I actually also have an issue with Price Targets analysts are setting here. Either you have to have a high price target or a near-zero one. An in-between target makes no sense as current share price means they are headed to insolvency before they can produce anything. This company is either a $10+ investment or a &lt$1 investment, there is no in-between.    TL,DR price-target &lt$1 and bankruptcy in Q4' 2021 or Q1' 2022 (if they are lucky they push it off till Q2' 2022).
YouTube suggesting Tesla rims but I drive a ‚Äò07 civic üíÄ . The algorithms must know something, the tendies have come.
Delisting a single company is a whole lot different than just shutting down hundreds of factories.Apple and Tesla can relocate their manufacturing. Alibaba can't just reincorporate itself in another country.
Tesla is 5 years ahead of old SI and CI engines. Data is king, Tesla will continue to rule the EV market
As a Tesla owner, I'll never buy a non-EV again. Once you get used to plugging in your car like you plug in your phone (and only paying an extra $15 a month for electricity), it just doesn't make fnancial or practical sense to buy something dependent on gas. However, this is a difficult concept to convey to someone who's never had an EV. You  have to live with one for a few months before you realize how much more convenient it is. So I think it's a weak argument so say that "everyone wants a Tesla." Everyone who HAS a Tesla wants a Tesla. But you don't really see the biggest benefits until you've purchased one.
You guys are clueless or something?  The US and Chinese economies are intertwined. Apple, Tesla, GM, KFC...etc.. we need them as much as they need us. You buy Apple stocks you invest in China. Globalization baby. No way around it.
My fear with Tesla is what would happen to the stock if Elon was to suddenly croak. I think the investors would run for the hills.
Elon Musk has told Tesla employees that he completely agrees with a recent price prediction from investment management firm Ark Invest. The New York-based company gave Tesla a $3,000 price target for 2025, believing by then the automaker will be delivering between 5 and 10 million vehicles per annum. This is a sharp rise from the 499,550 vehicles Tesla delivered in 2020, and would place Tesla right amongst the automotive elite in terms of mass-production.What a complete lie Chip shortage not stopping
You missed a couple of catalysts:1. Elon Musk's stock based compensation package is coming to an end. The exact number eludes me, but he only has a few hundred million left, after which Tesla will instantly be a few hundred million dollars more profitable each quarter.2. Model S/X coming back into earnings, including the new plaid. Only a few hundred of these were sold in Q1 and 2, which supressed earnings significantly. Starting Q3, we should see them scaling these back up to over 50.000 units of annual production. The new Plaid versions are also significantly more profitable, so it should have a double positive effect.3. Lots of new cars are now being built with the single piece casted front and rear underbodies. Getting this production capacity installed was quite costly in Q4 of 2020, but we should start seeing the production cost reduction coming into effect now.4. The $25K model is most probably going to be announced somewhere in the next 12 months, but it could be even sooner.On top of that there's still a ton of catalysts left for next year (first semi/cybertruck sales, ramping at Texas/Berlin, 4680 production, etc.)
IDC what anyone says , tesla is long term.  Yes the swings are amazing 2-3% in any direction but ik for long term its going to be worth a lot .
100%. When BEV market share becomes higher in countries on a continent that doesn‚Äôt even have a running factory yet than key players on that continent (eg, Tesla in Norway overtaking VW, Audi, MB, BMW, etc) things are heating up. When the used cars are selling for more than new ones because they are available now not in 3 months, demand is huge. India and other factories will be next. Endless demand for Semi trucks and CT but no rush to make them because you‚Äôre just pumping out profitable Model Y‚Äôs. The safest cars ever made. No dealers BS, no advertising costs. Attracting the best talent. The bullish story is endless.
I expect it to re-test $900 too. I‚Äôll be holding my shares. But yo shout out to the üåàüêªwho insisted on Tesla dropping to $400 before hitting $700 because they drew a couple lines with their crayons. I told them to zoom out but they didn‚Äôt listen ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
lol winners keep winning.  Facebook, google, Microsoft, CRM, apple, tesla, amazon, nvidia‚Ä¶etc.   Its not hard finding good companies‚Ä¶the problem is just buying them and holding them a long time and to stop yourself from buying the shit companies you think are going to ‚Äúmoon‚Äù
Well for example, you might think Tesla is ridiculously overpriced like I do and don't want to own it in QQQ
It is a hyper growth stock. In a few years it will turn amazing profit(watch the earnings report for more info on current statistics). Has high short interest(will be amazing for rocketing it up once this stock pops off). And also clover assistant is amazing. Also it is pioneering technology that could make this the next tesla but for the healthcare world.
Nothing's ever good enough for you r/all losers, ffs. If he got his $50k from putting $3-4k into Tesla five years ago, would that be reasonable? Or would DFV have to have started with $10 for you losers to stop making excuses about why making big money in stocks is unnattainable?
&gtLast quarter revenue up 140%.Gross Profit (which is very very different than Net Income) was also in the negative last quarter, meaning they are spending more on paying out policy benefits than they are getting on revenue. They are not profitable BEFORE SG&ampA, R&ampD, Interest etc. And before this is brought up, Tesla and Amazon both were "gross profitable" within the first 2 years.&gtAmong the highest single day FTD's of any company ever evidence of naked shorting before lockup expiry.I‚Äôm willing to bet the FTDs are from Greenoaks LPs short selling ahead of getting their shares from Greenoaks. Makes sense because the FTDs come T+2 after the Greenoaks transaction date. Greenoaks transfered 21M shares to their non-reporting LPs, 19M shares Failed to deliver but were then delivered over the next few days, likely when the transfer had settled. On the day the LPs would have had to make their short sales, July 6th, there was lots of downward pressure on high volume. The practice of short selling shares before you revived them is very common, since it‚Äôs basically the equivalent of selling them. With this said, anyone using this as proof of "naked shorting" is just trying to fuel their confirmation bias when a much more probable and likely explanation exists.
Terrible title by the original publication. There was no ‚Äúvictim of Tesla crash‚Äù these were *Victims of Drunk Driving*. Blaming the crash on the car is akin to being a DUI apologist.
Which is a Monday-Friday for GM, Dodge and Ford. But Tesla always getting the hate. Jeez I wonder why?
If there‚Äôs 3 things I‚Äôve learned here it‚Äôs don‚Äôt short Tesla, don‚Äôt short GameStop, and don‚Äôt short AMC.
Are you going to tell me your going to buy this piece of shit over a Tesla? Heck no.https://m.alibaba.com/product/62089603521/2019-High-Speed-New-Energy-China.html?spm=a2700.details.0.0.1e1a4275q4FNhG&ampredirect=1Calm the f down! No body wants a gm that you can‚Äôt even park in your driveway.
oOoOO never short Tesla lol
It's because they are forced to use parts from the existing inventory bins. Sandy Munro had a video comparing the new Ford to what Tesla is doing and is pretty informative. Many time Tesla wasn't able to get parts from distributors so they had to design/make thier own parts which meant they were designed for thier function, Ford took the approach of using parts they already have contracts on, leading to many unnecessary complications because they are trying to design the car around the parts they have.
You linked an article from more than a year ago. Super embarrassing. GM is getting completely shrekd in China. Can‚Äôt tell if you couldn‚Äôt read the date, or took a time machine here from a time when GM was a legit company.GM might not even be a company in 5 years time. They have closed all their plants due to ‚Äúchip shortages‚Äù and have a multi billion dollar recall on their hands while they‚Äôre swimming in debt.They can‚Äôt flip a switch and make EVs. They need to completely tear down and revamp their factories if they want to get them to produce EV, and they are moving embarrassingly slow.Their cash flow is dog crap. Their corporate debt is so bad that almost all of their revenues go to overhead and debt servicing. Just look at their EPS last year. It‚Äôs crap. Next month they‚Äôll whiff on their $1 per share price target and tank some more.Bet on Tesla or bet on a loser. Your choice.
you're mixing things up.Tesla is #1 with customer satisfaction, but ranked one of the worst in QC.
My idiot boyfriend opened a RH acc with my social, somehow this moron made 170k so im taking that and kicking his ass out tomorrow ü§£. Me and my new man gonna buy a tesla üöò üòé
GM has a lot of catching up to do if they want to push deadlines like Tesla.
Entry-level luxury cars sold with a 5-year $500/month contract, maintenance is included as long as you have full coverage insurance, which is conveniently provided by a subsidiary for another.. $250? Wrecks are rolled into repair inventory and you get a replacement from current model year, and if you make it to the end of your contract you're given the option to buy out the vehicle at 50% retail or extend for another 5, maintenance not included, or you can roll into a new vehicle and they take yours and fleet it out to internally owned taxi/rental/government/what have you. Suddenly you'll start hearing about how vehicle battery life seems to artificially degrade too quickly, and it comes out that electric subscribers are rolling into new models years almost exclusively while the old cells are harvested and the bad ones recycled internally for new vehicles. Probably there's a home charger branch as well to compete with Tesla, maybe like the powerwall?Too easy
Tesla buys cylinder cells from LG chem, not pouches/explosives.Good comment though, still giving you a thumbs up.
Tesla buys battery cells from multiple manufacturers, makes them into packs (cooling, housing, electronics). GM buys the entire pack.The bolt fires are not a cell defect but a packaging defect (failure of a system to compensate for cells expanding when they are fully charged and hot). Remember the Samsung galaxy note? Same problem. GM missed this because they don't have the capability to do quality control on the finished pack. And LG had a crap design and crap QA on this product line.GM also has a nasty habit of investing in scam EV startups.
You realize Tesla gets batteries from LG Chem right. But I give you a B+ for this excellent vid.S. Korea is the best with batteries, do a better DD PLEASE HOLY MOLY.But still giving you a thumbs up.
Yep. The video is accurate, because it shows GM actually making something, and Tesla merely talking about making something.
Tesla has literally only been profitable because selling carbon credits‚Ä¶..which happens because government. Just the facts. Everyone accepts the $$$$$. I‚Äôm not a fan of GMs stuff. But don‚Äôt pretend no one will catch up or even exceed.
‚Ä¶.how‚Äôd Tesla start up again. (Come on. The market is the market. Everyone plays the game. Do better.)
Tesla is no better, didn't they delay the release of some cars by like 4 years. Then there are a few other public EV companies without even a single car sold.
‚ÄúOutsources everything difficult‚Äù had me on the floor.Finally people are catching onto the statement ‚Äútesla is at least 10 years ahead of its competition‚Äù
Tesla has to watch GM make EVs, and we have to watch this guy write comments.
Say you missed out on the last Tesla bull run without saying you lost out on the last Tesla bull run.It‚Äôs not too late to change your mind before you are proven even more wrong in the future.
I vote for ban.  This kind of stupid post makes mockery of people who really YOLO.  Tesla shares and calling that YOLO?  I want my click back.
If it goes down, maybe her boyfriend will give you a ride in his Tesla
So you are going to place your bets on a stock you can't currently buy? WTF kind of comment is that.  Buy TSM until you can buy the other one, maybe, next year some time.I think I am going to buy me some Space X in 1 to 5 years when it goes public or rolls under Tesla as a parent umbrella company.How many other companies should I invest in that I can't invest in.Useless damn comment.
Have a couple contracts (2x 9/17 $7.50C) that I‚Äôm strongly considering exercising. Wish I would have went with my gut and YOLO‚Äôd these contracts. I think space is the next EV and tech boom, and think this company long term has potential to be the next Tesla or Amazon.
Unpopular opinion: I think you may be underrating the Mach E. To mustang shoppers, it is an abomination. But to potential prius buyers, it‚Äôs got some appeal (former Volt owner here). I‚Äôve been seeing more in my area than Tesla Model 3‚Äôs recently. Plus Ford has the in with fleet buyers. My state‚Äôs Fusion Hybrids are getting a little long in tooth.
Hot wheels Tesla?
Well, as an indirect proof: on his profile you‚Äôll see him asking people things on tesla and mortgage subs. Apparently he bought a model Y and was willing to put down $500k for a house and couldn‚Äôt get a standard loan from the bank cause he‚Äôs self-employed (read: stock trader). Why go though faking those conversations without any motive
Not a pump this is the future. Like buying tesla at $4
no way tesla ever works in india. thats an auto pilot nightmare
Lol people paid $250k for a Tesla roadster 2 back in 2017 and Elon just pushed it out another 2 years to 2023.Thanks for the cash infusion to stave off bankruptcy dipshits
So you're telling me Tesla has some roadster earnings set for 2023? I guess TSLA continue to go brrrrrrr
Hey 8 weeks before the tesla stock split it was 900 dollars. And then 6months later after the stock splir it was 900 again! Nvidia can do the same
So, not Tesla?
Tesla 2020 roadster pushed back to 2023, because 2021 they had supply chain issues ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
Tesla isn‚Äôt even ran by the founders technically
Chemicals? That has to be the broadest category out there...don't, say, Tesla batteries use *chemicals*?
Not exactly fossil fuel free seeing that a Tesla is 50% plastic lol
20% TSLA, 40% other ARK funds, 40% random wsb headline picks.Though if I'm not mistaken, Tesla uses quite a lot of metals.
How do you shun metals and minerals but justify what I only assume will be yet another ARK Tesla fund?
So she wants to buy more Tesla lmfao
like a‚Ä¶ Tesla roadster?
Tesla is the fastest growing religion and owning a piece of the promise land, a better future , a dream, a lifestyle. We all know you can't own Baba ... Xi does
A wins a win. I‚Äôm in it for the long haul. Maybe I could have made more money on other stocks. Or instead I could have lost 43% instead. Hindsight is 20/20. Compared to other automakers that aren‚Äôt Tesla I‚Äôm happy with the return.
Tesla is evaluated as a tech company, not an automaker
Depends what it is tbh, but one of them is already trading 50% off its high at 20 p/e and the other is at 385x earnings with 21% of sales and a good bit of production in China. Its also a US company which means Xi is actually more likely to do something to fuck them than they are to fuck Alibaba. If you look at the regulations, none of them have actually hurt Alibaba's business aside from the one time fine. Anyway, no one said BABA is a safe play. I'm saying delisting or any similar shenanigans would 100% end up escalating the trade war with China. In 2018 that sent SPY down 18% from Sep to Dec. How much worse would it be if China decides to do something more significant, like kick tesla, apple, Starbucks, Nike, etc out of China? Yall just think about what some of this actually entails risk-wise. Yall feel wayyy too safe in US equities but Xi can clap those cheeks real quick if shit escalates at all (like SEC delisting China stocks and saying their accounting is bs, how you think CCP would react to that)
You can also buy stocks in Tesla instead of IOU notes in a random foreign country that may or may not continue to have value in the future.
Tesla is not nearly as fucked as Alibaba is if shit goes sideways in China.
Tesla doesn't have legacy costs unlike old Automakers.
Even among US companies Tesla is profoundly overvalued
That would be a good point if Tesla didn‚Äôt already have factories all over the world. Sure it would hurt Tesla, but they are in no way the same position as BABA
Future is nice and all, but basically what they are saying is that in some obscure future Tesla is more valuable than Toyota, VW, GM, BMW, Ford combined, today. I mean what are they smoking?Tesla is nice and all. I get it. And maby at one day it will be bigger as one of them. Okay.But not bigger than all. No matter how good Tesla is or might be, it will never happen that everybody drives one. That's just a simple truth. Doesn't matter if they have the best cars in the world. People will drive / own other cars. But to reason the price of Tesla is a mistake in itself, so I shouldn't anyways :-)
Yeah but they do a lot of business there and have a gigafactory in Shanghai. If shit goes sideways with China, Tesla just as fucked as Alibaba is. If you think CCP can fuck around with their own company at any time, what do you think they'll do to fuck with US companies operating in China? ü§îYall not worried enough about US companies doing a big portion of their business there
Imagine AMC but with acctual fundementals and game changing tech, auto industry stands to lose billions in servicing and parts replacment . because of the simplicity of the endurace. Hub motors will be the standard someday. this is the most " green " a vehical could be. how much wasted and pollution is a result of having to consatntly manufacture thausands of differant replacment and aftermarket parts? the endarance minimizes that pollution and waste. im waiting for Tesla level price targets. Ride or die TURKEY gang! Gobble Gobble Gobble!
Yeah I love how he doesn't mention china once.By his logic banks are an even better deal because they are at 12 p/e or even lower. No need to analyze further. No need to even mention growth, future prospects, or even country of origin. P/e comparison with tesla is all analysis needed
Tesla is real. Baba is share of a shell company that have zero ownership of Baba the actual company. Chyna don‚Äôt recognize your share nor ownership.
Tesla destroyer of calls and puts
Dude cannot afford a Tesla on $58k/yr!
Look 10 years down the road and think where baba will be vs tesla
Well Tesla isn‚Äôt headquartered in China‚Ä¶ so there‚Äôs a big difference right there
The market caps shouldn‚Äôt be flipped. wallstreet has made it clear as day they don‚Äôt care about the now anymore, they only care about the future and the future potential. all these analyst see tesla future growth as insanely strong.
Baba is China.  Tesla is Merica. This is the only remark to be made.
My Tesla calls are so fucked
Tesla 5:1 split @ october, 6 ü§´
There is a reason why china requires foreign companies to partner with local companies and transfer ip in order to operate in china..they would rather reverse engineer and steal ip than put money into r&ampd..the lure of 1.4 billion population is too great for western companies..mark my words, they will do same shit to tesla..steal their technology and kick them out once their own ev companies are sufficient..huwaei,vivo and other cheap chinese mobile companies reverse engineered apple and samsungs tech.samsungs is pretty much out of china now..china claims to have more patents in 5g and ai but if you look at essential patents,most of them are worthless..china is all about fake data and stories-fake gdp,fake cornavirus numbers,fake company revenues,fake demographics numbers and fake r&ampd expenditure..check out this interview from michael pettis who claims chinas actual growth is half of what they claim..btw hes a acclaimed peking university(harvard or stanford of china) economist. https://youtu.be/4rdh6zf-9OY
I‚Äôm done waiting for a correction. Tomorrow I‚Äôm putting all my cash into Apple, Tesla, Google and AMD
I looked. It‚Äôs a bunch of posts about Tesla. So what?
OP is going to learn *a lot* about theta over the next two weeks.You're not up $15k OP, if Tesla opens flat tomorrow they'll be at $2.10. If Tesla opens red you'll likely be underwater.This is the kind of retardation I come here for üëç
That glitch made me shit my pants on Tesla
Tesla is a glitch right?
Yeah, babe, of course I shorted the S&ampP in March ‚Äò20, took those gains and loaded up at the bottom, got into Tesla calls when the stock was at $400, bought some ether, aped into GameStop at $5, also picked up AMC, NOK, MRNA, then shorted tech stocks when rates rose in Feb, while putting $50K on the Buccaneers at +1000 and Bucks for the NBA title. I‚Äôd be a clown if I didn‚Äôt.
BRING TESLA BACK TO 900
Puts on Tesla
Cathy Wood bought Bidu in February at all time high and dumped it recently after a 50% drop. She also bough Coinbase at the IPO. In fact most of her investments are really bad, its just Tesla, Nvidia and her other 50+ baggers that carries that portfolio.
Some dude with 10% left on his tesla battery is stuck in traffic trying to evacuate the hurricane right now. Puts on tesla this week.
Mark my words a black swan event will hit in like 2 months or atleast by December. The eviction moratorium is gone the entire market is just speculation. So many indications that we are about to hit a dot com bubble or even a 2008 event. But I‚Äôm also to scared to sell my 150 Tesla stocks in case it doesn‚Äôt happen.
Right. Meaning it‚Äôs crazy that a car company that hasn‚Äôt delivered a single car is worth 1/9th of Tesla, which has had a decade head start on EVs and has now branched into all kinds of other stuff.
No, they actually have legit talent.  The EVP of Engineering was at Tesla for 10 years or something.  Plus they have Amazon/Bezos backing with billions of investments and 100k order from Amazon.    Nikola was a blatant fraud.
1/9 of Tesla today? Am I reading that right? Lol
To be delivered over the next 10 years. Tesla will make 100,000 cybertrucks before Rivian makes 100,000 vans.
Tesla has more cars in space than they have in the road
I was actually hoping for Tesla boat..
They aren't suggesting the S&ampP though. They are suggesting single stocks. Specifically one stock, Tesla. So the variability is much higher vs the assuredness of paying off the house.
Not long ago Tesla was valued less than 80 billion and I swear all I saw in finance media was how overpriced they were compared to fundamentals.Tesla had less than 2 billion valuation at ipo and they were already selling a product.
Invest it, but not into Tesla. Invest it into a stock index like VTI or SPY
Interesting that they will be valued above what Tesla was valued when it was already actively selling the Model 3. I don't believe Rivian will have mass produced anything by the time of this IPO.
OP covers financials but doesn't explain WHY the financials are good, and will get better.Giant casting machines that eliminate 2/3rd's, or \~600 robots from each assembly line. Casting machines that complete an entire sub-frame in a \~2m cycle time.In-house 4680 cell production (coming, not here yet) to bring kwh for battery packs another \~50%.Structural packs, cutting weight and increasing safety and stability. &amp#x200BThe financials are a RESULT of the technology. The technology is the key. And Tesla is a moving target. If anyone else gets to where Tesla is in 2021 by 2025, where will Tesla in 2025 be? Once again, ahead. Always ahead.
Evicted tenants will go shop at Gamestock, catch a movie at AMC and order  a Tesla CyberTruck to camp in.
Very nice so then i'll buy my graphic card from Tesla since Nvidias are sold out or fucking what? Is Tesla in some kind of parallel universe I know nothing about? Please let me know
So you're saying Tesla is better than Nvidia
Tesla will become the real-life Skynet along with Apple.
So the Tesla truck isn't for actual work. Its purpose is to flex on peasants and roll up like you just came from the Halo universe
You should have spent more funds to get a deeper expiration and you should have spent more funds to get a lower call. $250 just to break even or still be under on GME before end of month is a big risk You got AMC Wayy too high to be plausible. I expect you will lose $5,000-$7,000 before you expire your delta Or I expect you to profit $500-$1500 by some damn miracle.  I lost $4500 on a Tesla ride so learn from my mistakes.  Go long on a delta and don‚Äôt ever buy a 30-60 day contract.
No tesla. Just a free glass of sugar water and this. https://imgur.com/gallery/Aeny2WH

BREAKING NEWS: TESLA TO SEND FIRST CYBERTRUCKS ON AFGHANISTAN MISSION TO DEFEAT TALIBAN- THE ONION
Just stick with Tesla
No such thing as the next Tesla.  That statement instantly sounds like a paid advertisement.
No. Things were kinda quiet and more rational until Tesla went crazy. Then Fed reserve's reaction to covid made the market invincible. And meme stocks also made everything crazy.
Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) appoints new CEO from IcahnLordstown Motors is building an all-electric pickup truck called the Lordstown Motors Endurance that goes into production in late September, next month, not years from now.  They expect all crash testing to be completed in the months following so approval to sell the trucks is expected to come in late December or some time in January.  They will already have stock on hand at that point since they are getting started building next month.They are using 4 electric motors, one in each wheel hub so it will have 4-wheels being driven instead of a differential being placed between the axles. They own a gigantic factory they bought from GM.  It used to build 400,000 Chevy Cruz cars per year there.  The factory would have cost GM billions to build it, but Lordstown Motors picked it up for only $20 million.  Lordstown Motors owns that, has some cash on hand and ZERO debt.Early this year the CEO and founder, Steve Burns, talked about pre-orders as if they were pretty firm orders even though they were non-binding pre-orders, the same as Fisker, Lucid, Tesla Cybertruck, etc.  If an automobile is not approved for sale by the government yet, you cannot bind anybody to a purchase agreement.  He said they were non-binding, but also said they were pretty firm.  No big deal in my mind, but Hindenberg wrote a short seller report saying they had no orders instead of over 100,000 pre-orders and the stock went from high $20's and low $30's to eventually under $5.  Steve Burns and the CFO resigned.Lordstown Motors also had to issue a going concern notice in one of their quarterly reports, meaning they were uncertain they would be able to continue another 12 months since they only had enough funding to get them through till the end of May 2022.Ever since the beginning of the year, after the Hindenberg report there had been nothing but FUD coming from every news source until lately.  News has changed to mostly positive lately and this morning it was announced that Lordstown Motors appointed a new CEO, Daniel Ninivaggi.  He came from Icahn.  It is important to note that Icahn owns a few automotive service brands including Pep Boys, AutoPlus, AAMCO Transmission and Total Car Care, Precision Tune Auto Care, Cottman Transmission and Total Auto Care, Just Brakes Total Car Care and Cap Consumer Auto Parts.Carl Icahn is a multi-billionaire, so it would be smart to speculate that their needed funding will come from him with a partnership agreement to be the service partner for the Lordstown Endurance pickup trucks.Stock price is currently $6.67, up over 20% for the day.  It reached $32 a couple times before the Hindenberg report.  If funding and service partnerships are announced soon and with productions starting in just one month, I believe the stock price could exceed those all-time highs pretty rapidly.  As of yesterday short interest exceeded 30%.Disclosure: I personally have over $30,000 invested in $RIDE.  I already did a YOLO post here on WSB a while back.  I am not a financial advisor.
Whatever Poor people have left is being emptying from their savings and put into riskier investments like stocks. This is the final stage of wealth being drained and transferred to the rich.  Rise upon rise week after week without a pull back isn‚Äôt a free market it‚Äôs a trap. Like when you value Tesla at more than all the other car manufacturers combined‚Ä¶ somewhere the maths is fucked.
Right now for every 100 decisions a self driving car makes, only 1 will kill you. Also that 1% is *most* of the problems, and more or less we haven‚Äôt solved any of them since 2015.But yea, trust Cathie on this one, she understands the tech better than industry experts and has no direct financial incentive to pump Tesla stock.
Damn bro calm down, never said you shouldn't buy mega caps I'm just stating that the S&ampP not dipping below 10% doesn't reflect the wider market. Holy shit everyone's here to make money, Tesla was a small cap 10 years ago who knows what the S&ampP will look like in another 10 years, if you see a small cap you believe in now why not buy it for big dildo returns later
yea and that's the point. As companies in the 400 to 500 range slide out, new up and coming companies replace them. Like Tesla. And by weighting those struggling companies make up nearly nothing. Company 400 (EMN) has a weighting of 0.04%. Company 500 (FOX) a weighting of 0.013%. Being generous that means Companies 400 to 500 make up just 2-3% of any SPY stock. For comparison sake, the top 10 companies (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, FB, GOOGL, GOOG, NVDA, TSLA, BRK.B &amp JPM) make up 28.1% of any SPY Stock. Heavily leaning into FAANG.
Wasn't she saying $4Tr market cap? How was she right about Tesla?
Why does anyone listen to this woman? At this point she‚Äôs basically just a Tesla/ Bitcoin bro.
Even if the robotaxi network gets that big that quickly (it 100% won't), it will have nothing to do with Tesla.It will be the companies that are actually making revenue off of commercial operations right now (think Waymo and Baidu) who are scaling up. Tesla isn't even at Level 3 yet lmfao. They've been stuck on 2 for like 7 years.
Notice how Elon said the Tesla bot will have "human-level hands." If that thing can jerk me off with a finger in my ass then I'll buy 3.
Good news means stock price drops lol then bad news means price up look at Tesla
imagine not having TSLA pay for your TESLA üòé
I usually save my day trades for Tesla, you can literally scalp a couple hundred pretty quick if you have time to watch it closely in the morning. Best of luck!
Tesla calls...Just found out that the AI robot girls are fitted with the RealFeel tongue!
What's your yearly salary How do you fuckers afford Tesla calls I make 82k a year better d have to save for 4 years before I feel comfortable throwing around 6-15k like that
Buying Tesla calls isn‚Äôt the problem. The problem is your strike and exp.
Exactly.  People told me Tesla at $200 before the split was expensive.  Apple at $50 before multiple split was expensive.  Google at $600 was expensive. Amazon at $800 was expensive.Nvidia just double dipped with higher lows and higher highs.
Fuck the TA. Tesla is going to the moon over the 2020's because of it's technology.Toyota + VW volume with BMW's margins.Oh and they have more cash on hand than debt and are going to be profitable from here on out. And not to mention AI day showed them as industry leaders.Billions in revenue from +1TWh of stationary storage. This is the company that is going to win the 2020's.
Those fucking bulls and their long ladder attacks on Tesla‚Ä¶ unbelievable
Shorted Tesla? Back to the Pit!
Cash gang after a meme rally feels good, just ordered a Tesla
Why so many people trashing GME? Either mad they missed it, own puts, or upset the market is so "irrational" Sounds like Tesla short sellers... tell me again that the fundamentals are not there please... Pathetic
Lucid isn't targeting the same price point as Tesla, and makes up substantial revenue based on that difference. Lucid is also planning to license their technology to other OEMs to produce cheaper vehicles in greater numbers without directly diluting their own brand value, all the while augmenting their revenue stream. Production estimates are otherwise based on the one existing factory however additional factories are in the works.
Great post. Have a little bit of lucid myself at 23 but I like the company as the luxury Tesla competitor
I remember bears used to say Tesla is a fraud and it‚Äôs going to bankrupt ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
How so? By making cars that have horrible production quality issues? I think Tesla as a car company is laughable. One day Tesla will eat shit after the fanboys realize they have been brainwashed into thinking Tesla is some magical company. Now Tesla is not just a car company and I think once gm and everybody else has fully functioning electric cars that can compete at the same or lower prices, they will probably shift their focus to the other areas they operate in, which is where they belong.
Yeah, I mean I would want to say this is a dumb move but I think long term investment in Ford (as in the next 10 years) is actually a solid move. Solely because they have restructured their product line to maximize the markets they profit in, they've made the right move to allocate research into electric cars (beating even Toyota), and they're releasing competitive new product families like the Broncos. So far the Bronco Sports appear to be on the roads and doing well. I don't think Ford is going to have any sort of jump in the short term to really bang the moon, but like idiocy aside... Ford stock might be extremely valuable in 10 years. And it's so cheap as it's always been that I don't think it's crazy to keep it. Plus, the government already demonstrated they'll bail out American car manus (but Ford didn't even need it) so it seems like a safe bet. Just my stupid take. I bought a few shares but don't have enough money to plow it as much as I'd like. Just hope the actual Bronco that hits the market is dope, and that in some years time they're smart enough to release an electric Bronco to get that gas-to-electric switch even easier to make for people who like bigger vehicles but not the price point or look of Tesla.
This is such a good analogy because it demonstrates a misunderstanding of the semiconductor industry by referencing a misunderstanding of the automotive industry. Will Tesla be a big company? Sure. Will it ‚Äúreplace‚Äù GM? Lol.
I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs easier or harder but I‚Äôm hyper focused on trading 2 stocks as my main focus and then I‚Äôll dabble with others. The 2 I‚Äôm hyper focused on is Amazon and Tesla

After watching that Tesla robot dance, I'm starting to think that Burry might be on to something.  Time to load up on Tesla puts.
I felt the entire thing was used as a recruitment tool more than anything else.I cant pretend to understand it, I barely got the basics, but the Dojo project was enough to convince me to add to my tesla position. I'll likely continue to buy as long as the price remains between $600-800. After that I'm just going to ride it out.
Humanoid robot that is actually useful is a lot harder problem than self driving cars. I don't think you should even consider the Tesla Bot when making valuations, and even if they have prototype next year, the software it needs will be another FSD level project. The amount of FSD development they have made was very impressive tough, and there's no question Tesla is the leader in self-driving cars, but unfortunately the timeline is still completely open.
The humanoid bot is just hiring bait and "classic Elon". I'd ignore it completely. They are rapidly expanding, and the bottleneck seems to be talent, and by showing off their "cool ai project" they're hoping to attract people. One of my biggest takeaways was that Tesla is currently operating *the 5th largest supercomputer in the world and it's growing*. That's mindblowing, considering they are competing with entire nations.

"But you don't understand1!1 Tesla is so good at research and development."I wonder if they've ever seen the charts where Tesla's R&ampD development has been pretty close to $1.5 billion for a while. Meanwhile Amazon and apple is almost 20x that. Nearly every big tech player in the US and most Chinese tech are investing 10x what Tesla is into r&ampd. Take Baidu for example. Less than tenth of the mark of the market cap of Tesla yet more spent on r&ampd. Baba is about 60% of Tesla's market cap yet is spending 6 times as much as Tesla.I'm honestly incredibly impressed with Tesla's marketing. Elon Musk is far more gifted at that than at delivering cars that pass more than the basic QA inspections.To answer op: every indication that we'd have would be Amazon or mayyybe a Chinese tech company like Baba (but that is very speculative). It's possible that the company doesn't even exist yet. Imagine saying in the 80s that apple would be the biggest company in the world over oil companies and established tech like IBM or Intel.
Tesla? Omg lmao a fuckin car company...is this a joke? On that note how are you gonna get you materials for you chips, batteries and alloys? One word AMAZON

Then you look at your reflection on the TV made by Tesla. All of a sudden you lose your appetite because you are also a humanoid made by Tesla.

If you want to work for Tesla, just put in your resume you are a self driven individual.
All I can do is think of Tesla. But what else is new?Last year they were 500k into the market, less than 1% of total global sales. This year they're helped not only by growing \~75% YoY but also that everyone else is getting crushed by the shortage. We'll be looking at over 1% of sales. 2022 rolls through with 2 new factories online, 2% or so, and onwards and upwards to 10-15% before end of the decade.

1) there‚Äôs no evidence that full self-driving will be available anytime soon (or soon enough for Uber)2) As much as Tesla is very vocal about full self -driving it‚Äôs most likely Google will get there first (and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Apple was next). Google will crush Uber with their massive scar, brand recognition and partner availability.So no, I don‚Äôt have a lot of faith in Uber being saved by some startup coming up with self driving first (because as far as I know Uber had to give up on self-driving research).

How did OP only buy 1 Tesla share I can‚Äôt get over that, I bet he wishes he had a time machine af
Shorting arkk is the same as shorting tesla
They most certainly love Tesla, and it‚Äôs ARK‚Äôs biggest holdings. In fact if we‚Äôre judging it off Reddit only I‚Äôd think people hate Tesla.
I repeat, AMZN went from more than $100 to $6. I very much doubt that many held on to their tech stocks through that crash. The fact that AMZN even fell that much says that everyone was desperately unloading it.Also CSCO is a legitimately great company with great fundamentals. Since 2000, their revenue has 3x and profit has 4x. But their share price hasn't recovered. The things that people were saying about CSCO back then are being said again about companies like Tesla. But hey...this time it must be different, right guys! *You can overpay for growth* regardless of how good the company is, and that's exactly what Cathie is doing. And look at what they do, not what they say. Cathie trades *constantly*. And don't confuse her overly optimistic speculations for fundamental analysis.
NIO will eventually go up, I firmly believe it‚Äôll be another Tesla
If you tried to equate how people buy cars and do research for 6+ months to how they yolo on meme stocks they would see that.  You wouldn't pay $20,000 on a $10k car but we'll buy tesla at a 350 P/E with 32% growth estimates and wonder why it slowly goes down with potentially exciting stuff in the middle.
I saw that massive 1,348.09% gain on Tesla and then look up to see that it is just 1 share.
I am sure he had a lot of Tesla from $45 and sold until 1 left. That's why he had $2.5m in his account too
Wow you're up on Tesla lucky
This exactly. This should be a top level comment. He did not bet a quarter of the portfolio against Tesla.
At 27 I had a net worth of -$29,800 ($30,000 in student loans and $200 in the bank)I started putting the max matched amount into my 401k. Since it came out of my paycheck, I didn't ever "see" the money. At 30 I had -$18000 net worth. ($10,000 in my 401k and $28,000 in loans.I started focusing on paying down my loans. At 32 in March of 2020 I had -$5000. ($15,000 in 401k and $20,000 in loans still)I tossed $1800 into the stock market. I wanted amazon. Too expensive. Google. Still too expensive. Fine. I'll buy Tesla. A whole 4 shares. My husband was livid that I had just "gambled" away my money, especially on a car company that was showing no profits. Sooo... At 34 now, my first 401k is at $25,000. I opened a new 401k with my new job which now has $15,000 in it. The stock market bounced like a superball and now my account has $20,000 in that. And I paid off my student loans. 34 at $60,000 net worth, not including the house purchased in 2017 for $180,000 and is now worth $425,000. This also does not include my husband's accounts.Luck may have finally been on my side after a rough go after graduating college in 2008.
Obviously, Tesla isint liable at all. Tesla says you must pay attention while driving, the idiots that didn‚Äôt take back control while driving are the ones that should be investigated.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/16/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa/Sell the news buy the fud. Are you buying?
I'm gonna be a dickhead and play devils advocate here, because I like the fundamentals you've mentioned... But Is it just me that remembers what happened to Tesla when they jumped balls deep into assembly line automation?Sometimes it works out cheeper just paying plebs to work repetitive tasks than to cough up huge capital for machinery that will end up obsolete in 5 years time anyway. I think the sticking point for $BGRY will be how versatile they're systems are for continuous changes, and how much training is needed to implement the systems.That being said I'm gonna keep an eye on this one, cause' it could be promising.
I thought ive learned over the last almost 2 years how not to fuck up. Yet here I am again blowing 15k on Tesla weeklies down 90%. I‚Äôm just peak retard thinking I could do this full time. Account just dwindling down since January hard
Im curious if you think Tesla has anything close to the equivalent difference in margin between those two companies? Every time Apple sells an Iphone Samsung needs to sell about 6. This is because apple is getting double the revenue for it on average while also netting 25% vs 10%.
Sounds like Tesla autopilot when an emergency vehicle is stopped in the roadway.
This is precisely it. This sub has had several conversations regarding Cathie woods "investment" decisions and universally every thread always boils down into the fact that she got lucky with Tesla and then caused and rode  a self influenced hype wave related to pharma, clean energy, tech and crypto. Although a bit late in crypto. Then when things began to tank(6 months ago) because all the companies she dumped money into were hugely speculative and extremely high risk, she defended her position with statements like this then quietly got out by citing a shifting strategy to focus on those companies that she has conviction in. Which is a nice way of saying, she doesn't know what the fuck she's doing. She has no business having as much influence or attention as she doesn and Burry is going to prove her wrong spectacularly.Burry has made plenty of bad calls in the past, he got it right with the sub prime and I 100% believe he will be right about Cathys ARK but it won't be because of Tesla.
&gt I can see how you believe that for sure. In a perfect world I would be right by your side in that thought but we don‚Äôt live in a straight shooter perfect world.What? The other poster‚Äôs point is that *even without any interference*, they find it extremely unlikely that Tesla would get that successful. The two of you don‚Äôt agree at all.
Great company can be a bad investment at the wrong price. Tesla is a great company but bad price.
If they were the biggest car (Toyota - 250bn), energy (Exxon Mobil - 350bn) and insurance company (Allianz - 80bn) in the world right now Tesla would just about make up its market cap (680bn). Or say Tesla does become the biggest car manufacturer, do you really think the _possibility_ that they create AI is worth $440bn?Do you really think that's likely? Or maybe do you think the share price has got a little ahead of itself?
Imagine at that interview taliban screams "Tesla to the moon" lol
It‚Äôs easy to like Tesla but think the stock is way overvalued.   Tesla market cap is bigger then Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM and Volkswagen combined.  There is never going to be a point where half the cars you see on the road are Tesla‚Äôs, which Is kind of what the valuation suggests
&gt It‚Äôs very hard to believe that Tesla will tank or won‚Äôt become the sole owner of the entire EV market.You realise that at the moment Telsa have around 11% of the global EV market, the lowest it has ever been?There is very close to 0% chance that they 'become the sole owner of the entire EV market'.The US is only the third largest market for EVs, after China and the EU.
Tesla gonna straight ruin me again‚Ä¶.wow
Compare Tesla's market cap (710B) to Walmart (419B). Walmart does over half a trillion in revenue (~12B earnings), while Tesla claims to be pulling in $50B revenue vs (~4B earnings).So what we have is Tesla with 1/10th the revenue and 1/3 the earnings. Are their superior margins enough to justify the $300B premium on their share price?
Burry is not shorting Tesla because it‚Äôs a bad company or overvalued. But because it‚Äôs piece of a much larger puzzle regarding a single security with idiosyncratic risk.
Tesla likely has a nice future, but no doubt the stock has been memefied by the fanboys who took in elon as their new papa after steve jobs died.
Shorting Tesla is one thing, but shorting an ETF that holds 10% Tesla is completely different.   He‚Äôs trying to capitalize on the popularity of ARKK and the growing sentiment against it from retail investors who bought it at the top after a 100% run up in one year.
&gtNone of these companies truly make actual money from their CORE operations - looking at Tesla carbon contracts.You must have missed Tesla's last earnings report where they did precisely this
Michael Burry is short Tesla again and of course the FUD is hitting hard. Let‚Äôs bury Burry. $TSLA
&gt If you can hold a short position for a few yearsAnd therein lies the crux.I'd like to short tesla, but all I can afford is something like a 100P 12 months out.
Even Musk has said that when Tesla posts disappointing results one quarter the stock is likely to come crashing down. It‚Äôs not mentally dissonant to believe it‚Äôs a great company, but also that $700b is a highly speculative valuation.If you can hold a short position for a few years there‚Äôs a pretty good chance of turning a profit
Bro I have a Tesla‚Ä¶. I love Tesla ‚Ä¶ but when I hear Burry is betting against Tesla‚Ä¶I take a second and wonder why it‚Äôs trading at 650-700 a share
What is Burry‚Äòs reasoning for shorting Tesla? He seems convinced
Why did I touch tesla deep yesterday fucking why
He's amassed crazy wealth over the years. Just because he's not always right doesn't mean his plays are bad. If I can go to the racetrack and successfully pick a 50/1 horse one out of every twenty bets I'm going to look like a loser to most people who watch me for 3 or 4 races. Watch me for 3 or 4 weeks and you'll realize I'm a gambling savant.If theoretically he says Ark is going down 80% by 2024 and he places low cost options bets on that every month from now til then, guess what he'll still make a shit load of money on the play if it crashes in 2024.Now he has certainly straight up lost money on plays but I don't understand how people overlook that he made a ton of money on the GME run up pre squeeze. And he also shorted Tesla successfully recently it seems. So he's not actually wrong as much as people here would have you think. There are long term plays that take time to develop and maybe this is one.
They are following the Tesla playbook page by page. This is the part where everyone buys cheap and then the result of the investigation concludes that the auto pilot didn't malfunction and the stock jumps back up

Tesla down 4% after a fatal auto pilot crash means we can correctly determine Tesla is now valued at 24 human lives
Breaking: Aug 16 (Reuters) - Five children and an adult were taken to hospital with injuries after a self-driving Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Model 3 crashed in a school car park in southern England on Monday evening, the Telegraph reported.TSLA 100 PUTS are almost free
The list of undelivered promises from Elon on self-driving are pretty insane. I used to be a really big fan, and still am on his work with SpaceX, but the Tesla's recklessness in marketing has really tarnished my view of him.List of promises here:https://twitter.com/Christiano92/status/1390667466515308544Great video documenting how dangerous what Tesla is doing is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxXiTf4sO54
I am a long-time Tesla Bull but would be wary about betting on stock price movements based on catalysts here. For me, Battery Day was huge and yet the stock did not go up right away. I invested a ton more money into TSLA around then and ultimately made out well on it.Regarding the catalysts you mention:Crash Safety - Whatever Tesla says will likely be taken with a grain of salt as getting proper data to measure this is challenging. I think it is self-explanatory, so won't bother trying to detail an explanation. Also, crash safety has to be significantly higher to convince people that something changed.Autobidder - Tesla energy is supply constrained right now, so this is not changing the bottom line much, if at all now. That said it is a good long-term thing, but doubt the impact to the stock price.Robo Taxi - Will simply be disregarded as long as FSD has a while to go before such a system can be implemented. Business plans for this are premature as well and will inevitably change over time.Basically, I don't see any market moving catalysts mentioned by you. Instead I think we get a more investor focused (prettier slides) of what Karpathy has previously talked. Also I think we get more insight into DOJO and perhaps a few other interesting tidbits about AI. Maybe a reveal of either the Model 2, X, or Roadster or something else they have been working on.
Agreed. I'm not giving Tesla a blank check but let's not over scrutinize because it's new technology. That honestly seems like a very low number of crashes.
Congrats OP, and fuck you. I bought a Tesla put two weeks ago and almost shit my pants. Paper handed it today for a $200 profit
How many non-Tesla vehicles crashed into stationary emergency vehicles from 2014-2021?
To add a source for this : [https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/59057/tesla-admits-full-self-driving-is-just-level-2-autonomy/](https://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/59057/tesla-admits-full-self-driving-is-just-level-2-autonomy/)&amp#x200BTesla FSD is still misleading marketing even if it is only released to 2000 testers. Level 2 autonomy is in no way "Full Self Driving"
&gt"Next year for sure, we will have over a million robotaxis on the road," said Musk on October 21, 2019. "The fleet wakes up with an over-the-air update. That's all it takes." [link](https://www.thedrive.com/news/38129/elon-musk-promised-1-million-tesla-robotaxis-by-the-end-of-2020-where-are-they)Elon Musk constantly makes statements which imply the technology is much farther ahead (and therefore much safer) than it actually is. It's very debatable whether these statements cross legal lines, but they most certainly cross ethical ones, in my opinion. And one can argue that every company stretches the truth a bit in advertising but we're not talking about a hamburger that doesn't look like the ad. We're talking about 2 ton missiles that can easily kill.
There are enough idiots. There is one in Bay Area who ‚Äúdrives‚Äù in the backseat of Tesla all the time. https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/backseat-tesla-driver-unapologetic-after-arrest-for-reckless-driving/2544875/
How are you up voted? Tesla literally calls the upgrade full self driving and it is not which is exactly what the poster is referring to. Its level 2 autonomy, you are making false statements. If tesla true full self driving isn't available to the public don't charge 10k for a misleading upgrade.
It's amazing, generally, how much Tesla can get away with a lot of things.
What i find most interesting and yes im a tesla owner but not a fanboy. I have my own issues with them. the biggest being this area wondering what the hell is the driver doing during this time? If you are paying attention as you are supposed too, things like this dont happen. Who in their right mind is watching the road and just letting the car run into an object thinking its going to stop or turn away at the last moment? Now if it was a car lights off stopped in the middle of the road on a completely dark hwy. Sure i could see maybe because you look away for a moment (happens to all of us no matter what we are driving) and at hwy speeds you cover a good distance pretty fast. But otherwise, other than blaming tesla for giving people a false sense of security (which they do not, they specifically say you better be paying attention and in control at all times). I dont see how any of this is their fault with most of these incidents.
Musk said a few times it was around the corner, while possibly every engineer worldwide in that field choked from laughter hearing that. Except tesla engineers, as they probably choked from fear instead.To put it simply, this is the limit of this kind of passive, self driving approach. Radars, lidars, cameras, all the kind of sensors used have limitations, and AI processing (used a lot to process their data) has too. Namely, AIs provide great results when you only need  a "good enough" result, not an exact result. If errors cannot be tolerated, then you must not use an AI. It really is that simple. In my opinion the idea of using AI for this is a massive mistake, but I am not surprised chain of commands will always make a manager somewhere to believe that if something works 90% of the time, throwing money, time and engineers at it will make it go to 100% one way or another. There surely is some progress to be made, but nothing is going to get significantly better without a different kind of sensor that does not exist today (not at a reasonable price anyway), or without switching to a move "active" approach, like equipping every vehicle with trustable, automated communication devices and managing them. This, of course, is not around the corner either.Tesla's documents clearly state the cars are not autonomous though. While the option name itself could be a problem, they repeatedly said it requires a human. I doubt this is enough for lawsuits, but I do not live in America, so ... maybe.disclaimer: not a tesla anything owner (except maybe through a synthetic ETF). I work as an embedded software engineer with hobbies around cars, robotics and AI, in a different sector too.
I know right. Tesla has a good cruise control system, but their marketing stun to call it "Fully Self Driving" is way over the line.
What are the chances Tesla opens a factory in Afghanistan ?
I NEVER WANNA TOUCH TESLA AGAIN HAHAHAHA -10kAlone TODAY ON IT
Ah yes tesla being investigatedGonna be one of those +5% days
Can't wait to see people with their 50k camper in their backyard with no cyber truck because typical Tesla delays
It‚Äôs meant to be a hiring event, to get young people to apply to Tesla.
Yes NKLA was a scam, but thats because they didn't actually have the tech, not because the tech isn't desirable.&gtThe theoretical maximal efficiency for creating hydrogen than using it for fuel cells is worse than Tesla batteries already on the marketThe selling point is potentially lower rare earth requirements than current batteries. That's a BIG deal that current research says is plausible, and is probably required long-term if the goal is to eliminate fossil fuels. You know, theoretically, if NKLA actually had a product.
Tesla barely leases any vehicles and they auction off lease returns just like every other captive financing company. Stop making shit up.
it will be years before tesla produces what they say they can produce
Tesla is currently valued higher than the top 5 car manufacturers combined.  It finally being cash flow positive doesnt change the fact that Musk fits OPs description to a T.
Ford is releasing several EVs. BMW as well. I'm sure I missed some companies. All the car companies will have EVs in the next 5 years. I personally don't think Tesla will remain at the top of the pile, but I don't think they'll go bankrupt or anything.
Tesla is up 19% in the Afghanistan stock market.
Not saying Tesla is going to die, but other car companies are actually entering the EV space now. So they actually have competition. We will see how they hold up compared to more established brands and their new EVs.
Reason why tesla is collecting all leased model 3 after lease ends. No buy after lease option. They are getting ready for driverless taxi in their own.
Tesla is cash flow positive retard
Not so sure about Tesla
Rememba when all these competitors were coming to kill tesla?  Pepperidge farms rememba
Youre forgetting that fully electric cars were fucking shit before Tesla. A brand can't last 10+ years if their product is trash. Esp in the public markets.
None of the pre-Tesla vehicles were household names. They sold in the dozens, maybe one or two of them in the hundreds. Maybe.
Full electric cars predated Tesla. The technology was already fully available by then. And now we have basically every major auto manufacturer rolling out their own line of fully electric vehicles as well. Tesla's insane valuation does not come from its sales or from the performance of the vehicles. Their valuation comes from one thing and one thing alone. The brand. Musk knows how to pump his brand and make it synonymous with the idea of "the future." And he also knows how to mythologize himself into this role of the super genius modern day Tony Stark figure that is also a giant selling point for his stock.
I add Tesla to this list because they are only profitable recently because other manufacturers have to buy EV credits from them to be in compliance. This will end pretty soon.

Battery companies will be in high demand for the next few years. Tesla can‚Äôt get enough batteries to meet demand and plus all these new start up will increase demand. MVST is fully integrated and they been producing in China and now Germany then soon in the US(2022). Check all the DD, MVST is Great long term play with some exciting short term pump.
What if Tesla already uses AMD chips?Also, in case you weren't aware of this, which you clearly are not, the reason AMD is eating Intel's lunch is not strictly because of performance.  Actually, it's almost entirely because Intel's parts are huge power sucking monsters, and any sane engineer planning out a data center looks at total cost of ownership, of which power consumption is an enormous driver.AMD is crushing Intel in the performance/power consumption curve, *already*.
Elon threw his last $30m into Tesla in march 2019 he was literally jacked to the tits.
maybe he will fomo back in like musk did with tesla
Disagree. The early Model S vehicles had a substandard touch screen that couldn‚Äôt handle temperature extremes. Every single one of them. Tesla tried dancing around it until they finally started using a touch screen that was more appropriate for vehicles. Substandard paint on a hard top, while unacceptable, is vastly different then the touch screen that effectively controls the car.
What the fuck does this have to do with Tesla? Which vehicle that Tesla makes is remotely comparable to the Bronco?
You‚Äôre downvoted but you‚Äôre not entirely wrong. Tesla‚Äôs have tons of documented QC issues. Like, all you have to do is a web search. I would applaud Ford in this instance for stopping sales until they get this fixed because it‚Äôs unacceptable for them to go out this way. Tesla would‚Äôve covered it up/minimized the issue for as long as possible and continued pushing the cars out the door. If you go to the Tesla subreddit, there is literally a laundry list of things to look at on your new car to check before accepting it due to the litany of QC issues Tesla‚Äôs have.
Just remember next time anyone says "This is gonna be the next X!" (Replace X with amazon, google, tesla, whatever) that you need to stay far away from the retard and any of his/her/whatever-stupid-ass-pronoun-their-emotionally-soft-ass-uses ideas.
Well I‚Äôm with you guys on CLOV and PLTR‚Ä¶ also 1 Tesla call expiring tomorrow lol
I‚Äôm by DC and drive all over Virginia and outside DC some days it feels like you see an honest 5-10% Tesla or hybrids.

Made $3k from Tesla in 10 mins lol
Dear brothers and sisters,  We have been in a tug of war with the hedgies for the past months. We had a technical breakout (NOT SQUEEZE) to $28.5. They pushed us down like a rock. It has been painfull. It has been frustrating with all the times they have pushed us from $10 to $8 in the span of 1/2 days. It has been frustrating with so much fake news, FUD or that a great company is being looked at as a joke or "pump and dump".  The haters were wrong. They did not do their due dilligence, because if they did they would find out that:  Failiure to deliver shares was as high as 19M in July. This equals to 15% of the float. FAILED to deliver. Compare this to AMC and GME at their peak, and we would beat them with 3M and 6M FTD. We are at 19M! THIS IS INSANE!  Shorts are NECK DEEP in this. Company is valued at over $3B. Short volume in dollars is at over $1.2B. Imagine that! Only other company I can remember that hedgies tried to kill this hard is Tesla. I was there in 2020 and it changed my life! Now $Clov will change all OUR lives! No wonder they have tried to kill momentum so many times!  By doing these ladder attacks and always pushing us down, hedgies are banking on making us frustrated, tired and make us panic sell. What they don¬¥t realize is that we apes have evolved. We have social platforms on Reddit, Discord and we share information with eachother. Shorts stand for about 50% of the daily volume - and don¬¥t get fooled, they will come hard at us today as well!  But we will FIGHT back. We will prevail! This is a great fucking company that will disrupt the dinosaur health care industry. Company reported over $400M in revenue, 140% increase year over year, membership is at over six digits and $Clov is growing like a beast! The Clover assistant will bring over $1B in. THIS IS INSANE. How is company valued only $3B? Easy, because market value doesn¬¥t reflect the reality. If shorts were out of the picture, we¬¥d be hovering around $25-35, but because of them, the sky is the limit.  My dear brothers, my dear sisters. Fuck the corrupt system. Fuck SEC and all other institutions. Fuck the 1% that always cover for each other and make life miserable to the rest of us. Don¬¥t we deserve freedom!? Don¬¥t we deserve to live a life where we can actually live instead of just surviving? Don¬¥t we deserve the chance to make our own future!?  We will accept this no more. No longer shall corrupt hedgies be able to bankrupt great companies. No longer shall corrupt hedgies steal money from us. No longer shall they rule us by fear. FUCK FEAR. FUCK PAIN. It limits us. The system is built to limit us, to make us sheeps, to not let us reach our potential.  Clover Health is a company that will change lives. It will help a lot of humans. It will revolutionize the health care industry, and remember this is only the beginning. Today, we got the catalyst we needed. The volume premarket and after hours has been insane. Today is going to be a fight, but we WILL WIN.  Don¬¥t sell this stock for peanuts. It¬¥s worth FAR more. If we look at the options for this week, if we surpass $10 and we can go as high up as $50. Should you sell? FUCK NO. Wait for MOASS. The squeeze will bring us to several hundred dollars! The fundamentals will take us to $100 in a year alone.  Brothers. TODAY IS OUR DAY. Far too long have they put fear and pain into us, but today - we fight back! Pain and fear is temporary, it might last for a minute, an hour, a day or even a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take it¬¥s place. If I quit however, it will last forever.  LETS FUCKING GO CLOV FAMILY!
Evidence supports the opposite, though.  He got his first fortune (hundreds of millions) from the sale of PayPal, and then he plowed *all* of it into SpaceX &amp Tesla.  Most other industrialists wouldn‚Äôt risk their entire fortune on ventures they themselves think will most likely fail.  As another data point, he recently sold all his houses and currently lives In a relatively modest rental.
I cashed out at $12k profit from CLOV. But to make you feel better. I lost it ALL plus 16 % on actual companies. NVIDIA, Tesla and more. Yeah thanks.
Tesla $850 by eom
Say what you like about the financials or the CEO, but for me it's Tesla. Not even the cars, just the solar part of the business. If in 50 years every home in the US has solar panels on the roof, that would be awesome.
Ignore the downvotes.Accelerating the adoption of renewable energy in transport is very important and Tesla is doing a great job of it.How many other companies have a goal like that?  They're all "maximize shareholder value".Making human life multi-planetary is also critical to the survival of our civilization but most people are not interested in thinking on those timescales.
Nice! I started with around 14k as well, mostly invested in AMD, around 4 years ago, was buying and selling amd, then switched to tesla for a bit, then some crypto, now own 1000k shares of AMD and some crypto. so far turned 14k it into 280k, I hope I don't lose it all!
Yes but that is because people ignore the normal advice which is to hold total market funds. Tesla's inclusion in the index didn't do anything bad to me because I already held Tesla via a total market index.
You're exactly right. When Tesla was added to the S&ampP500 its value increased as Funds which tracked the whole S&ampP were essentially forced to buy it as a consitutent of their basket.
BlackRock also owns roughly 9% of Tesla. Second largest shareholder behind Musk. BlackRock is getting heavily integrated with the Chinese government- important, considering they‚Äôre the largest car market in the world.Tesla is memed but the future legitimately portends well
Me: $75 dollars in November for Moderna is too high for my likingAlso me (January): $35K on TSLA at $865. Nailed it!Next Monday: Fuck! Tesla DROPPED!Me (Now): SaltyCongrats my fellow ape!

Pussy, what happened to the days of taking out $50,000 student loans for Tesla calls? Fuck what this place has become
The crazy thing is that Coinbase is actually relatively cheap compared to traditional brokerages in forward sales multiples because how fast Coinbase is growing.      This reminds me of Tesla and how so many people were using ICE auto maker multiples b for realizing Tesla can sustain much higher margins.
You literally can copy the plays its public record.Don't even have to look and I know its just amazon, tesla, Apple , and other fang calls. That's mr Pelosis big thing
Lmao all it is is leveraged plays on faangs.Deep itm calls on Amazon Apple fb tesla and the like. Shit ain't corrupt lol ton of professional degenerates do the same
Yes color me shocked.  This has never happened to Tesla. They are always on time with their releases.
Heres some info on the  trucks Walmart Canada has  under contract with Tesla500 miles range allows a driver to go to their destination and back without recharging (500 mile range at maximum weight at highway speed)Capable of 0-60 mph in 20 seconds with a full 80,000-pound load and can climb 5 per cent grades at a steady 65 mph (compared to 45mph for same grade in a diesel truck)Google has more.

I miss TSLA pre S&ampP.Swing trading was free fucking money man.Elon schedules interview with Joe Rogan.&gtOh fuck Joe's gonna ask him about DMT, let me buy some puts*Elon literally smokes a fat ass joint even if he doesn't inhale. Boomers freak out.**TSLA opens 7% down**Don't even bring up taking Tesla private.
I sold tesla stocks @ 280. It was even before split.
I love TSLA with all my heart, but I¬¥m going where I see the most opportunity and money to be made. I¬¥ll get back into Tesla again in the future, but hey, I was there since $100 share price, pre stock split. I¬¥m happy and I don¬¥t think we¬¥ll see another 10x this year.Now I¬¥m going to enjoy the same ride on $Clov. Being an investor means taking what you believe are the best cases. Here I can easily 5x-10x+ my investment, when squeeze goes through.Follow the data young padawan. 19M FTD shares (15% of the fucking float, failed to deliver) and get in instead of downvoting me.
One year of Tesla ownership down the drain. I‚Äôll never buy another gas vehicle again.
If Tesla hits $850 next week I‚Äôll get the logo tatted on me
Only buy an electric car if you want one, not because of cost savings.  They are too expensive right now.  There are a ton of less expensive (but better) electric cars in the pipeline.  My advice is to drive the Honda till the manufacturers are on the second gen of their electric cars.  The only exception is Tesla because they are already on gen 4 and are worth every penny.
&gt Pretty sure I know what the answer is, but is it worth it?The answer is always no in this subreddit, but in 2019 I traded in an 18 month old car for a Tesla and have zero regrets and would do it again.If you can afford it after doing all of the responsible stuff (paying bills, saving, contributing to retirement, etc) then go for it. In my case, I have a healthy emergency fund, max out my IRA, 401k and HSA every year and could comfortably afford the payments. What the hell else am I going to spend my money on? Can't take it to the grave with me.
Made $500 today, thanks tesla.Done for the day, see you all tomo
Rush? Go buy a tesla plaid, do bungee jumping, paintball, whatever. 300k a year...come on my guy.be smart
Lol, indeed, a deposit was made. If only Tesla would start shipping their damn cars!!

&gtTesla pushes back Cybertruck deliveries to 2022 as anticipatedTSLA $900 tomorrow.
It has been held down because wallstreet understands this is the true winner of class 8. Tesla probably won't ever produce a class 8. Nikola will be bankrupt this time next year. There is just no competition. This is why the stock hasn't went up even on news of receiving environmental credits, news of a 300 ERX order, and news that the truck can run off a battery for 75 miles (3x longer than previously thought). It is being held down because this company is a gold mine and if you look at recent SEC filings, institutions are loading up.
typical WSB retarded post about some stock that already went up 20x. inb4 hey guise have you heard about this company called tesla? they're the future for sure get in now before it's too late!
Yea that‚Äôs like buying Tesla in 2013, pffff. What an idiottty
The govt looks out for the very poor and the very rich, but nothing to help the white, upper middle class who are just trying to afford a Tesla.
The shares held by institutions is over 80% percent. Wouldn‚Äôt take much to move the price. Also WsB loves AMD and Tesla and those are way bigger
So what are your thoughts on Tesla? Or all these pre revenue companies? I'm not a GME guy, but there are some stocks that don't have the traditional fundamentals investors are used to looking for, but are still good investments.
"Long Term"Sells Tesla at 34.
Says who? GME, AMC, Tesla and I'm pretty sure Hertz offered shares while being shorted. As long as the company and the bank believes there will demand they can do a new equity raise. Or they raise capital through debt. Which shorting would have no influence on due to equity be subordinated in the cap structure.
No you retard it means Tesla puts
Simple. Live below my income each year, saved raises and bonus. Never got into debt and invested in the stock market for long term. I also don‚Äôt buy flashy clothing with logos. I also bought tesla at 23$ and sold at 34$ thinking I was making a killing. HahaNo BJ‚Äôs but I‚Äôll think about a reach around. Lol
Tesla cut their P/E in half in the most recent earnings call . This is why P/E is such a bad metric for high growth companies. If you wait for the company to be insanely profitable before you invest then you will surely lose out on pretty much all of the growth going up. In addition to this the high amount of liquidity in the markets would always lead to such valuations. Your method of waiting is appropriate for when interest rates are high that speculation on future value is not worth it because of asymmetric risk reward. TLDR: P/E not best metric , Interest rates low and high liquidity leads to more risk taking.
who cares about energy credits? I said production rate is increasing 50%. Competition has been ramping for 7 years now and has nothing to show for it. First it was the Chevy Bolt, then the Jaguar I-pace and the Audi E-tron. You're telling me the mustang Mach-e is going to be the next Tesla killer with less range, more expensive, no autopilot, no supercharging network worse technology when compared to a model Y?
Using Tesla as an example ? Wasn‚Äôt it‚Äôs PE ratio like 1400 6-7 months ago ? And it‚Äôs growth is even accelerating. Now at only 365 it even seems undervalued. You‚Äôre looking at historical PE. Forward PE is really the only valuable metric. It doesn‚Äôt seem to high right now. A crash is possible but trying the time the market is really hard. Good luck.
I wouldn't assume the stock would tank.&amp#x200BIf Elon Musk showed his balls on Good Morning America there would be thousands of  20-40 year old dudes on Twitter arguing why it proves he's willing to do anything and tripping over themselves to put more money in Tesla.
Yolo it on Tesla 800 weeklies and tell them you forgot what happened
Puts on our dumbass Government for not including Tesla at the ev summit
MVST -Morgan Stanley called a Price Target 6$Remember Morgan Stanley called 60$ while Tesla was 2000$
Have you looked at the market caps of EV companies? Tesla alone is priced as though it will have 100% market share. Lucid has yet to produce a single vehicle, yet has a bigger market cap than Kia.
Tesla would be like $20 a share if it expected to stay at current production levels
Tesla calls always looking better
That soccer mom Model X from Tesla would still smoke it in a drag race.

Tritium makes charging hardware and is going public under the DCFC ticker symbol (SPAC). I know very little about them.CHPT - Chargepoint - Their business model relies on the sales of cloud services to partners that provide colorful reports on charger utilization. The partner provides the power and in many cases the maintenance as well. Each charger nets them at least $300/year in revenue, with more if the customer buys a maintenance plan.EVGo - EVGo builds the infrastructure and pays for the power, and profits based upon how they bill customers. Their primary revenue source is customers using the network. Their prices are a bit high, but they are working on getting really valuable locations.  BLINK - They revenue share with the site hosting the charger and are mostly installing low-reliability chargers at usage prices that make gas look dirt cheap. Without a major change in their business model, I don't see this going far, but the upside is that low information site hosts (often in the hospitality industry) find them appealing.VOLTA - Advertising based free charging. The way I see it, these guys have figured out a way to buy billboard space in high traffic areas for &lt$100/month in operational costs. Its a really clever business model. Not sure how sustainable it is, but maybe?Electrify America &amp Tesla Superchargers - Automaker subsidiaries, so not independently traded. Probably closest business model-wise to EVGo, though with slightly different pricing strategies.I've probably left out some other charge equipment manufacturers, but I can't think of them right now.
After I watched Tesla go 1300 -&gt 2500 in front of my eyes, I stopped asking what causes Tesla surges.
I get from your SEC link that:Robinhood only has 81B assets under custody (AUC).  For context Schwab has 6.69 Trillion AUC.  \~39B vs \~127B market cap for the two companies.Robinhood had less than 1B in total net revenues in 2020, yet their market cap is now 40 B?That valuation is totally absurd. People mock Tesla's valuation but for context Tesla had 31.5B in revenue in 2020 and it's market cap is 702B.  Robinhood's market cap is about 40x 2020 revenue while Tesla is closer to 22x 2020 revenue.This is not investment advice.
Can Tesla go higher?
Odds are extremely high of any company losing their edge on a 10+ year timeline. I'd think Tesla is more likely to become blackberry than Toyota is. Blackberry was the 1st, but Apple was Apple.
So, is today the day Tesla became a real stock?  Down on good earnings, looking like an actual vehicle company.
I feel like we re visit this reason every earnings season, do not play earnings, due to the fact that MMs are in control. They spike IV, to over 100% and then you all wonder and ask why your options lost 60-80% value at open when Tesla had good earnings. It‚Äôs because your IV went from 110-140% to less than 60% IV. That crushes all your profits and that $500 you spent on that option, instantly turns into $200. Read about IV Crush before you play earnings.
Ofcourse Tesla dies üòÇ
Uh oh Tesla got sent to the concentration camp with the other cultsLet's see how this plays out
Yeah Tesla the OG meme stock
I was gonna take the day off then i noticed that Tesla is in the cursed threadDo the mods have no shame?
Typically after a stock split, the stock goes down, unless it's Tesla.
For your comment to make any sense whatsoever, I have to assume you are carefully scrutinizing every last investment you make in US companies to be sure they don't have substantial assets in China? I mean...yeah...not like Microsoft has offices and teams there or anything, or Tesla has factories or anything......orOr are you just having the absurdly misguided thought that by not investing in companies who in name primarily are "Chinese" you are avoiding all this shit and all the implications? Cause probably if you own any S&ampP500 you are investing in China's future plain and simple. Foreign investment helps the economy stay strong ergo help the CCP stay in power, yeah, like even hiring their programmers

We produced and delivered over 200,000 vehicles, achieved an operating margin of 11.0% and exceeded $1B of GAAP net income for the first time in our history.Supply chain challenges, in particular global semiconductor shortages and port congestion, continued to be present in Q2. The Tesla team, including supply chain, software development and our factories, worked extremely hard to keep production running as close to full capacity as possible. With global vehicle demand at record levels, component supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for the rest of this year.We successfully launched Tesla Vision in Q2, which was mainly possible due to our ability to use data from over a million Tesla vehicles to source a large, diverse and accurate dataset. Solving full autonomy is a difficult engineering challenge in which we continue to believe can only be solved through the collection of large, real-world datasets and cuttingedge AI.Public sentiment and support for electric vehicles seems to be at a never-before-seen inflection point. We continue to work hard to drive down costs and increase our rate of production to make electric vehicles accessible to as many people as possible."
Why would they try and send their ICE investments into the red? If it weren't for Tesla and that meddling Elon, they would've gotten away with it too.
Dear Heavenly Father, Forgive those who bought Tesla calls for they do not know what they are doing. Give them strength, peace, and comfort thru the IV crush. Amen.
&gt 2024 really will be the year that tests how much of the market Tesla can hold on to.That's fair. I'm looking forward to seeing how it all ends up, I certainly don't know for sure but I'm pretty confident in Telsa and will keep diamondhanding my shares.That being said Tesla has what, 2 factories operating ATM, one in Shanghai and one in Fremont? With Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, they're going to what, double-triple their manufacturing capacity? &gtYes Tesla is battery limited and it makes no financial sense to dump all of them into trucks that will eat up all their margin to try to fight in a market that is extreme hard to compete in.I also know very little about how hard it is to compete in the BEV semi market, it seems to me it's a growing market that still has lots of room to grow for industries around the world to replace their ICE fleets of short to medium range semis. Then again I'm kinda talking out of my ass because I really have no idea, it's just an educated guess on my part.&gtTesla blazed the path and now the rest of the industry can walk on in with a fraction of the capital investment with enormous established customer bases.Tesla blazed the path, but most other OEMs still have a lot of issues with their software and batteries. The path Tesla has blazed, has been to the benefit of Tesla, and they're not sharing how they did it. All the other companies know it can be done, they just have to figure out a way to do it. So far it's been rather disappointing with lots of promises and few high-quality products delivered.Tesla blazed the trail, they know how to make cars, and now they're going to produce massively more. The other OEMs know how to make ICE cars, they're still struggling to catch up to Tesla, and Tesla is going to keep blazing ahead with giga-casting, 4680 (when they're ready), [getting their own lithium supply from Nevada clay,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mej1erLgCIs) and more.Scaling up isn'T easy, the model 3 production hell showed that, but Tesla has better products and is in a better position to scale up EV production than pretty much all the competitors. I hope we get lots of great BEV options from many different manufacturers, but I don't see Tesla getting dethroned anytime soon.
&gtAll too accurate. Everybody is ramping fast Funny, people have been saying that for a decade now, and we have Toyota with no electric cars and trying to push back the transition to EVs, VW with cars riddled with software issues, Chevrolet with self-combusting cars, GM with a huge investment in vaporware (Nikola) and a battery system that looks impressive but we don't actually know how well it will perform, and while Ford has some good EVs, they don't have many nor do they plan to produce a ton.&gtTesla doesn‚Äôt have a working design group that can spin model refreshes at the rate other brands canI'd rather have a good EV with the same design for a decade, than shitty EVs that can't even run right. &gtThat‚Äôs part of the reason the semi is delayed - PACCAR and Daimler already have their semis in production.This is fair, but I think also another huge reason the semi production is delayed is Tesla just doesn't have enough batteries. With battery production in Giga Berlin and Giga Texas when they're done, that might change, but maybe the 4680 isn't quite finalized yet, who knows.&gtIt‚Äôs kind of amazing that they made it through S3XY, now time will tell if they can do a major model refresh - customers will only let you make the same body for so long.Given Tesla literally cannot produce enough vehicles to meet demand, and consistently tops the charts in pretty much every country, I don't think that's a problem, not for a long while yet.Meanwhile, none of the other car manufacturers can produce cars that approach either the quality or the quantity of model 3's and model Y's being produced. OEMs better hope Tesla doesn't come out with a 30k EV anytime soon.
marketing genius is correct tesla doesn't spend money on advertising and they are lightyears ahead of other car companies in terms of EV manufacturing, engineering and software. no other company is close which blows my mind not a single established car company was really even trying before tesla
They've been in production for two years already. Source: the article linked in this post and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\_Megapack#Completed\_deployments
I hope Tesla shoots to $700 by Thursday so the IV crush circle jerk can stop for a few posts.
Apple will join the fray, never. There's not going to be a dozen Chinese manufacturer, Nio has their blessing XPEG is also doing okay, Tesla in China is considered a luxury brand and Shanghai can't keep up with demand.Tesla is overvalued if you don't understand Tesla. EV's are only a part of what they do. Most valuation models only focus on EVs and ignore everything else, so of course a PE of 200 looks high.
Toyota lobbying is not for the the reasons folks think. The EV OEM business is terrible business for manufacturers. Toyota is going to lose so much $$$ they were making from service, not to mention the barrier to entry is now much lower to make an EV car rather than combustion engine. Once you have the commodity battery, it's not too difficult. Wait until Apple and a few more Chinese manufacturers join the fray. Tesla is overvalued AND Toyota is going to get rekt at the same time.
So you're saying Tesla is going to end up drawn and quartered and its remains spread around the world as a warning to EV companies only to inspire more to take its place?
I found this place after turning 5k into 80k on options - not gonna lie 40k came from tesla option with a two crazy ass hits - while doing more research (googling shit) on how to to make better trades. With the assistance of some helpful people here that showed me how not to blow up my account I was at 180k some.I stopped looking shit up and got addicted  to wsb lol. Since then I have lost 120k and I still can't quit you fucks lol.
There is still bears in tesla? Holy crap. Lols
Not sure why people are flipping out over this. We‚Äôve seen infinitely stupider plays on WSB.He‚Äôs buying contracts barely OTM. The stock is $664 in after hours. It doesn‚Äôt take much to see Tesla move heavily. He has complete break evens at around the $685 price point (literally only 3% beyond where it‚Äôs currently at) and that absolutely could happen by Friday, where IV doesn‚Äôt even matter.
Don‚Äôt forget competition! Meanwhile Tesla took 0.8% of the automotive market last year, will take ~1.1% this year, and will likely exceed 4% of the car market by 2025/2026. Tesla is the competition.
At one point and time you could say tesla was living off government funds for profit . Those days in my opinion have been long over and the company delivers damn near every quarter more or less.Not surprising the ice car companies are trying their best to delay the ev future . Its very frustrating seeing the price and believing it should be alot higher.
I'm a simple person. I see Tesla, I upvote
I invested my entire life savings into Tesla puts. I need it to open at $100.00 tomorrow or I‚Äôm fucked
You can't say that P/E is invalid just because Tesla is growing so quickly. If you want the P/E to drop to something reasonable, like 30x, that would require the company to grow by 12x. In other words, you're already pricing in 12x growth as you purchase Tesla stock today. Tesla does have a decent probability of continuing its growth, but pricing in 12x future growth is an extremely risky strategy no matter how you look at it. And remember, that growth needs to happen in order for the CURRENT share price to be justified. If you want to actually make a reasonable percentage, you're actually betting that Tesla will grow by even more. And that the future demand for Tesla shares will continue to be high enough that the market will pay you a 30x multiple.P/E is obviously flawed in dealing with companies like Tesla, but you cannot just extrapolate explosive growth into the future. I think that there is a case for value investing in Tesla if you plan to hold for the next several years, but it is an extremely risky strategy.
Agreed.  TAM is too large for just tesla (and let's leave autonomy out of this convo).  I'd be more scared about how overcrowded the short trade is at 17% of the float than the valuation, which is well within range of reasonable comps. With that much cash in that teams hands, you really think they won't have explosive growth?  You do you.  Buy puts.   I'll sell them to you.
Once again we here "the new &ltinsert car manufacturer&gt is going to be better than Tesla along with their &ltinsert new self driving technology&gt." We've been hearing this year after year and no one has anything on the market. I'm not saying they won't but I've been hearing these comments for like 5 years now.
Tesla margins are in same category as Ferrari. So high what it is unattainable for other automakers tnx to 0 marketing spending
Toyota makes a dying product - ICE cars. It is clearly on the wrong side of the technological revolution.Tesla is spearheading this revolution.You're arguing for Nokia stocks a couple of months after the iPhone was announced.
That's the thing about hypergrowth companies, they can crush crazy looking multiples fast. Look at AMD which seemed to float above 160 for a while, but then crushed it down to just the 30s through revenue growth. Tesla went from negative to nearly infinite to 650 down to 350x PE fast. Forget FSD, forgetting even 4680 for a second, if the four gigafactories alone get to full production that remaining 350x will be crushed down even further rather fast too.
I hope you don't invest in Apple, Tesla, or all of the other American companies with substantial Chinese business and sweatshops in the region then
Yeah. Looking at it including growth (aka PEG ratio): Tesla has a 52% yoy revenue growth in the last 5 years (obviously ebitda or net income isn‚Äôt relevant as they don‚Äôt have a 5 year record).    Therefore the PEG ratio is ~7. FYI, historically a healthy PEG even for high growth companies is very close to or below 1.
Tesla BAG holders: AH doesnt mean anything ü§°ü§°ü§°

I don‚Äôt see Lucid as an actual threat to Tesla as of now. They don‚Äôt have any cars on the market  yet and their price point is way more expensive than Tesla models. But I gotta admit, Lucid‚Äôs cars look dope af
Tesla going to either go up 10% or go down 10% in premarket tomorrow. Either way, dicks gonna be hurting.
But this sub told me Tesla was sure to fail because of their Bitcoin investment and regulatory credits!
Keeping my Tesla calls til expiration. Going down with this ship!!P.S Elon please shut the FK up and stop being a btch. Yes production is hard.
Tesla up 2% ah means calls gonna be -50% tomorrow. IV is huge on shit like Tesla
There‚Äôs gonna be some serious Tesla loss porn tomorrow
Yeah Tesla almost always tanked after earnings. Their current stock price was already pricing in like 10 years of explosive growth and good earnings, so unless there‚Äôs unexpected stuff coming from Elon himself I don‚Äôt see it popping up.
Tesla gonna tickle$700 tomorrow?
Isn‚Äôt that how Tesla started?
I‚Äôm such a fucking boss these Tesla calls gonna preeeeeeeenttt yolo‚Äôd my whole life savings eod today. Fuck yeah. The look on my bosses face when I told him I quit and Elon was my daddy now was priceless. So glad I can just shit post w you retards and trade all day forever nowüòä
Tesla is opening up the Supercharger network to anyone soon, as per Elon.
It's based on Tesla being an energy and AI company. Automotive manufacturing will be one arm of the company. The TAM is absolutely ridiculous - look at the top global companies by revenue and energy dominates. You're right though, it comes down to execution. I believe they will do what is necessary to obtain these lofty goals. Many don't. We place out bets and continue to wait for results a few months at a time. That's the market for you.
They've yet to bring a vehicle to the market, whereas Tesla is selling hundreds of thousands of vehicles each year now.Same with Rivian, who delayed their vehicle yet again until September now.
I think there's serious reason to believe the traditional automakers will quickly close the game (2-3 years) on Tesla in terms of EVs. Many are already doing better on quality of their builds, it's really a matter of closing the gap on battery tech. The electric F-150 looks miles better than the Cybertruck, and on the luxury side, you have to be consider what Audi and Porsche are rolling out on the top-end.As far as self-driving tech goes, Tesla doesn't seem to have any sort of edge over the competitors at this point. I don't think anyone still considers FSD a key part of the Tesla thesis, but I still wanted to mention that.All that said, anyone investing in Tesla is not doing so thinking of it as a car company. You'd be insane to invest in any auto manufacturer at that price.
Tesla üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ
all you tesla bulls and bears need to wait for the actual call first
Anyone ever notice the Tesla logo looks like an IUD? Lol
I lost count. All the previous Tesla killers were acquitted on all charges.
tesla is crazy. I wouldn't dare get in now. too much swing
Tesla will probably pump tomorrow morning, usually it drops AH worse than this during earnings, but because it‚Äôs relatively stable currently and still up for the day, I expect it to rocket off tomorrow Just my retarded opinion though
Tesla is going to surprise us all.
Where‚Äôs that guy that bet 600k on Tesla 700c expiring Friday?
"Tesla is only profitable because of regulatory credits ü§°üëå"
Tesla did this well even with supply issues
How‚Äôs my Tesla 410 puts
Shouldn‚Äôt Tesla be up more after hours today?
Tesla keeps going to $666.  Is Elon Musk the devil?
Anyone who thinks Tesla is gonna pump because of a big beat and bought calls doesn't understand that Tesla is currently priced for a big beat for the next 40 quarters in a row lmao
Rip that guys 600k in Tesla FD‚Äôs
Tesla bulls &amp bears gets wiped out together lmao
Those were great earnings and Berlin news wtf Tesla should b up 10%üò≥
IV crush can fuck off when tesla opens at 700 tomorrowü§£ü§£ü§£
This million dollar is literally free money to Tesla. This thing will sell a lot more than you guys think. All the commercial &amp development is eyeing for this one. With current politic pushing green shit, this thing is gonna sell like hot cake.For commercial application, owner can depreciate this fucker and claim tax credit, can recoup 80% in first year as long as there's tax appetite and other 20% over following 4 years. All of you retard degenerates are literally giving free money to papa Elon via tax venue.
Unless Tesla swings higher to like $700, people who bought calls are still IV fucked.
tesla with the big dick quarter god damn
TESLA I don‚Äôt think the move is enough to stop the IV crush. ü§ûüèª hope it ends up being enough the market expects a 10% move atleast
Elon needs to anounce a tesla with blowjob mode for u to win
# HOLY FUCK TESLA BEARS R BIGLY FUCK
5k in tesla calls and 50k in shares for earnings
Sounds like early tesla
Probably. But IV isn't terribly high this earnings. Definitely have seen Tesla with higher IV with no earnings.
I'm having Tesla flashbacks
I‚Äôm sitting on the sidelines but really rooting for Tesla on earnings today. Hope it moons, we need more companies looking to clean energy future.
it can also tank hard if tesla slacks a bit and competition catches up
But the banks are stronger than ever and worth more than ever 13 years later‚Ä¶so 2008 crisis really didn‚Äôt harm them as much as folks think. (Sure Lehman and their idiotic boss went under, but Goldman, JPM, Morgan Stanley, BAC are all doing very very well with record profits and compensation.)I do agree with Elon here and think Tesla has far more long term value as a tech company/alternative energy play than as an automaker.
You charge them at night when energy costs are low. Sell that energy back to the grid during peak hours. I think the long term goal for the Megapacks and even the smaller Tesla batteries is to basically sync them all up in their Virtual Power Plant and eventually phase out peaker plants.
Tesla doesn‚Äôt make batteries they pay Panasonic
It‚Äôs very hard to know where tesla will be in 10 years. They could be the Amazon of renewable energy or Elon could blow up going to space
I'm retarded, what's the use of a Megapack? Who buys them?   Like solar energy storage bought by towns and large companies for Tesla owners to recharge their cars?
Problem with Tesla is the current price. The company is definitely the future. Problem is that you're already paying more today, than they will be worth in 10 years. If prices come down to reasonable levels. I will definitely buy TSLA stock.This is not financial advice.
Yeah.... it was funny at first because you had companies like Tesla skyrocket from 180‚Ç¨ up to freaking 800‚Ç¨. A insane jump, but than the stock continues to rise to over 2000‚Ç¨. But now I associate "to the moon" with scammers and pump and dump schemes.
Over the course of the 2020's Tesla is going to do to legacy auto what the 2008 financial crisis did to the banking industry.Tesla Energy is, now in 2021, where Tesla auto was in 2017-2018. When it's FULLY on its feet it'll be like Elon said. ‚ÄúI think long-term Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive...‚Äù
Will be the highest mileage, 100 more miles than Tesla Plaid even.
Remember - Tesla is just an overvalued car company and their battery tech is nothing special, anyone can do batteries. *Pay no attention the the Chevy Volts that are autoimmolating.*
If there‚Äôs a crash I‚Äôll just be up 50% instead of 100% on Tesla. Whatever. I‚Äôm holding till Valhalla
Another pre-revenue company in the EV space...Wonder if by the time they are done their IP will be worth much.Remind us again what the pricing on the Lucid Air is....Their first planned car is the Dream Edition at $169,000, next the Grand Touring at $139,000, then the Touring at $95,000 (and about 400 miles of range) and finally sometimes in 2023 the Pure edition at $77,400. The Model S Long Range with about 400 miles of range is available now for $80K... So dollars for range, Lucid in 2023 hopes to be in competition. Let me guess that the majority of those 10,000 reservations are for the Pure Edition, which bodes poorly for Lucid. If the earlier versions have any issues, why would people not switch over to the Tesla Model S which has the same range and you have access to the supercharger network? Even without any issues, if the Pure does not surpass the Model S Long-range overall (and don't tell me about quality until they produce cars and this can be seen in real life) then Lucid just has a very small market super-expensive car that they will sell maybe a few hundred to a few thousand of a year.Actually the projected price of the Pure which is not out till 2023 (maybe late 2022 if everything goes perfect for Lucid, which it has not so far) indicates that if they are actually getting better efficiency for the Dream and Grand Touring models at about 500 miles of range, it might be costing them a pretty penny to accomplish that. If you can't build a car affordably for a given set of features it is not that important what you can do otherwise, if your goal is to be a mass producer.
Not even a joke. They basically *are*, my Mormon parents are investing in GME.https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/mormon-church-100-billion-fund-gamestop-stock-gain-tesla-stake-2021-5.
Suits say we have had 6 corrections this year so far.  They all seem to last a few days tops. If the market does crash it better for me tesla will be $300 apple $60 airlines $20 a freaking fire sale. No matter what I'm not leaving
Elon Musk just sold Tesla to Bill Hwang
Lucid looks good so there is that. And Any Tesla to date in production is a Model S clone.
Elon also claims to be a founder of Tesla, he bought it.
Fabulous excuse to give the grandkids as to why there inheritance is 2000 shares of a penny stock...  "We were bullish AF at the time you know, one guy actually worked at fuckin tesla!  I mean he ACTUALLY. fucking.  WORKED THERE, couldn't go tits up orrrrr well that's we thought at the time..  and I had a wicked dream of tendies after a weekend of binging on ayahuasca and dmt but anyway....  here's your shares."
Clov is going to the moon soon. It's the next tesla of insurance industry.
They've been around and known, just not in a general public way like tesla so no one has heard of them.My advice is get in now.
You'd think it doesn't need explaining, except Elon continuously trys to say Peter Rawlinson wasn't important at Tesla.
It‚Äôs been one negative story right after the other since the ANT IPO fell through.  Everytime the stock starts recovering it seems like something new comes up. I personally bought a bunch of BABA @201 and JD@70.  I personally view it as worth the risk and sooner or later the FUD will fade a bit and the ANT IPO will happen and the shares will recover.  It would be crazy for China to handicap these companies and open the doors for Tesla to dominate in China and so forth.  Shooting themselves in the foot. This is just my opinion and this is not investment advice as I‚Äôm half retarded anyway
thE cEo WAS viCe presiDEnt of VEhIclE ENgIneErING at teSLA
Wow.. nice to see a sane comment lol even if lucid could be half of tesla I‚Äôll be happy. Want to see both companies succeed
I see you big Tesla guy, perhaps you‚Äôve become annoyed with those who say ‚Äúlucid is Tesla killer, bla bla‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not Designed to be. Their business plan isn‚Äôt to kill Tesla. They are going for a niche, highly profitable market of high end EVs. They won‚Äôt be trying to compete with mass automakers of ev‚Äôs. Anyone saying otherwise is just recycling rawlinson PR bullshit. Of course he‚Äôs gonna say they are ‚Äúbetter than Tesla‚Äù. That‚Äôs flashy. What‚Äôs he supposed to say? ‚ÄúOur production capacity is relatively infantile compared to the reality of mass automakers?‚ÄùI wonder where he got the idea for an EV CEO vastly overpromising what his company can do. It‚Äôs business
I mean he once considered himself the founder of Tesla, was sued, paid,  and now gets to call himself a founder. Dude is nothing more than a wallet imho. The patents are put in his name but I don't think he's done much if any actual engineering at Tesla.
Lucid is to me an EV player amongst the Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Bugattis. A high-end luxury car with high-end performance. It will be a status symbol for the wealthy: celebrities, politicians, bankers, CEOs, sportsmen,... I see the "somewhat cheaper" Tesla as a car for entrepreneurs, small managers, civil engineers, realtors, lawyers,...Just my personal comparison between the two but I could be completely wrong.
Without government subsidies, Tesla wouldn't even be profitable
They're doing the exact same path Tesla did.Except that they're also looking for a partnership with some Honda/Toyota to build cars together with Lucid electric tech
Only Tesla investors insult somebody by calling them a "vapid sycophant." You're kind of weird for that bro
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so odd seeing all these Tesla shills complain about Lucid, I think it‚Äôs a win win for both companies
Exactly, they ditched Tesla to go with Lucid. Must be a more convincing play behind the scenes. To me I like both companies but only hold Lucid because I can‚Äôt afford Tesla anymore. Plus the battery issues, vehicle fires and solar roof lawsuits are too much to worry about.
Tesla has plenty of competitors, but I guess youre being more specific and saying no EV competitor right now. Fortunately, there are many many many EV competitors on the way and the best part is you'll be able to get them serviced by third parties and not rely on just them after purchase. :)
I only see this is a long term hold. The merger is priced in. It was common knowledge that it was happening. I was high on them for a long time but I sold off cause I see this stock tanking back into the teens at some point after IPO. I‚Äôll be shocked to see it spike right at IPO because nothing fundamentally has changed. Depending on how low into the teens this gets, I might be hopping back in. Still worried about their success long term though. The market is vastly different now then when Tesla did this.
I don't think Lucid is a tesla competitor. It seems more geared towards S-class or BMW 7 series buyers. The only direct EV competitor is the Mercedes EQS. Even Taycan is not a competitor since it is even sportier than Model S.They have the potential to do very well in China and Middle Eastern markets where being Chauffered around is way more common than in Western markets.
I'm DCA this for many many years. Best EV tech in the market in my opinion at the moment. I'll be adding another 2k shares on open. It's easily worth way more than it traded under the CCIV SPAC.   With new stores being built on the monthly and the great car reviews they've had I don't see any high-end competitor giving them a challenge.     People love to bring Tesla into the mix but that isn't even what Lucid is marketing their cars to. The only thing those two have in common is the vertical integration business model. With Lucid selling their drivetrain to other EV companies plus their battery manufacturing experience and the Saudi PIF backing I don't see how they can lose. They plan on expanding to the Middle East an into China in the next few years and those people in those wealthy areas will gladly buy the luxury.  I do like their plan on making a 30k version of the Air for the Average Joe that will be a smart business move. I'm guessing they will split the cars to keep the luxury separate from the 30k Joe car similar to how Hyundai had Genesis split off as their own "luxurious line".  The one thing they have over Tesla is that they have gotten to sit back and watch all of Tesla's failures over the years as things that they know not repeat themselves. The only company I see competing with is Lucid is possibly Rivian but they had a rough month for their debut.     Atleast with Lucid Motors you actually have an assembly line which is more than half of the EV companies in the market can claim sadly......I'm long on this one. It may be the only stock I got faith in with this screwed up sideways trading market. Maybe there is hope for us all in this one so fuel up that rocket ship and make sure Houston hears us loud and clear lol.
Selling puts on Tesla is going to net you about 1% a week. You threw out big numbers (25k a month) but in the context of a 740k cash secured put, it‚Äôs 1% a week. Not a terrible return but certainly not worth the risk. If Tesla crashed you‚Äôd be out a fuck ton of money. You also assume Tesla will be trading at a number near 564. If it dropped to 300 you‚Äôd be so incredibly fucked. You‚Äôre either making nothing selling calls at 600 or you‚Äôre selling calls at 350 with the risk of solidifying your losses when those calls cash.
It sounds like you got rid of it at the right time. Every bolt manufactured from 2017-2019 is now recalled, and you have to follow strict guidelines to maintain it at home which included not parking it indoors and keeping the battery between 25-90%. GM now has to replace all the battery packs entirely sucking up the batteries for 70k more cars, or just buy the cars back. Those pouch cells sound like they were expanding too much to be contained and would fail causing thermal runaways. They may have fixed it with newer models, but they are a few generations behind Tesla.This is why Tesla leads in battery technology. They have had a decade to fine tune the battery management system and be able to effectively design and control batteries to last year's. The bolt was almost entirely LG technology, and this is what happens when too much of the car is outsourced.
Shit you can buy 12-13 weekly cash secured puts in Tesla (strike price $570) with 85.88% chance of profit of $6500 a week making it $25k+ a month with that $750k. And even if you get assigned, your break even is $564, and than you sell Covered calls for like $600 strike.
I recently interviewed with Lucid for autonomous controls engineer. They‚Äôre actually ahead of Tesla
I hated Tesla but I didn't really know why, maybe because it kept being pumped in wallstreetbets back in 2018. So I bought a 2018 Chevrolet Bolt EV. Worst decision of my life, so much fucked up issues with this car.I decided to buy model 3 in 2019 and I am now a huge fan. High quality, high reliability, and I no longer have the same level of stress worrying about my vehicle.
New plants, higher demand for EVs (which are only a few % of total auto market), improved margins with scale, eventually amazing margins with software (primarily FSD) are just a few off the top of my mind.Competition is great. More EV options means less combustion engine cars sold. When someone buys an EV, as it is a large purchase they research it heavily. First they go to their favourite brand, then they look at leaders in their car type category which is often Tesla. Yes Tesla won‚Äôt win everyone one of these but the ones they do they take away from someone who owned a combustion engine previously.
I think another important factor for Lucid is that their CEO understand that this is a technology race. Car companies have been stagnant for decades. The industry needed a rich fanatical nut to come along and disrupt things and Elon Musk was kind enough to do that. He disrupted an established stagnant industry. Now Tesla can't keep up with demand. Traditional car makers are coming up with half-assed EVs so they can say "we have an EV too". But Toyota's infotainment is still shit. Their driving assist features are basic. Wireless Apple CarPlay has been out for almost a decade and no one but BMW bothered with it. Tesla is taking modern technology and putting it into cars. That's why Tesla is a threat to traditional car makers. And now Lucid is too. Lucid is a long way behind Tesla, but I think Tesla has gone a bit too far with their insanity. Tesla broke the ice, but they seem more focused on selling hype now. Fudging numbers. Making wild promises. They're over promising and under delivering now. But the momentum is there now for EVs to replace ICE vehicles. Tesla could fall behind and if so, Lucid is the next in line that understands this is about bringing modern technology into vehicles and not just about propelling your car with batteries.
This car is built by the ex lead engineer from Tesla‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs not a concept‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs Lordstown
Just from a consumer standpoint, FSD's inevitability is what tipped the scales for me to purchase a Tesla. Otherwise, I could've gone with a slightly cheaper EV, but I want my car to drive me. I don't think I'm the only one with those preferences.
Obviously. Tesla needs batshit insane earnings every quarter the next decade to justify the current valuation.Every "good" earnings report is going to bring expectations closer to reality, not the other way around
Man, Just do you. Tesla is gonna make us so much money selling EVs credits, batteries, solar systems, energy etc.
AAPL had almost $15B in profits in 2010 with $65B revenue. Tesla profited $700M last year at a 2% margin. Not even close to being similar, but nice attempt. Try again?
The CEO of Toyota has clearly positioned the company against EVs. They are pursuing hydrogen gas vehicles which shows how out-of-touch they are. In terms of EVs, Tesla has the head start obviously. If Toyota doesn‚Äôt start developing EVs soon they are going to cede a huge chunk of their market share to Tesla.
Tesla fanpages is where I get my investment advice too
The ignorance in this comment is astounding. First, Toyota‚Äôs CEO has clearly positioned the company against EVs. Toyota is pursuing hydrogen vehicles which shows how out-of-touch they are. Tesla won‚Äôt have to worry about Toyota. Second, batteries are going to be bottleneck for EVs, not bumpers or any other part. Tesla is the only one capable of mass manufacturing EVs right now and so they will have priority when ordering batteries and minerals. Ford simply will not be able to manufacture any significant number of Lightnings because they will not be able to secure the batteries.
This.  Do any of you guys actually own a Tesla or experienced the current state of FSD? It‚Äôs about a smart as a drunk toddler. The current cars on the road will never have full self driving capability. Not with the current technology and definitely not with the technology in the cars right now. I‚Äôm just waiting for the class action lawsuit. It will happen. People will want their money back. I know I do. $10,000 is a lot of money to pay for an empty promise. I got in at 5K and that was still too much to pay for lane change assist.
I don't complain about problems. My car has had no issues in 33k miles and 2.5 years other than some scratches from the shipping carrier that Tesla fixed. The only delivery issue aside from that was a stitching error on the seat which they fixed. I rotate my tires, bought one new set which had a 60% Michelin prorated warranty discount, cleaned and replaced my air filter and add washer fluid as needed. It needs no other maintenance otherwise and constantly improves with software updates, but the current update is taking a while to get FSD out which required a fundamental restructuring of the autopilot algorithms to fully utilize the FSD computer. I still consider the FSD hardware upgrade well worth the money even though it's taking a while to release the software.I pay 9 cents a kwh in Texas so it only costs me around $6.50 to charge my model 3 for around 230 highway miles. I took a trip to North Dallas and started with 300 miles of range, drove mostly on highways from 75-85mph (I am not conservative) and got home with 6 miles left and drove it to 0 miles which hit 232 total miles. Then I plugged in on my 50 amp charger and it took 8 hours and 45 minutes to fully charge overnight. When comparing against my old scion tc I still have, that car costs around $35 to fill up for 280 highway miles. Electricity is 1/5 the cost of gas and I never plan to go back. I will replace both of those vehicles with a cybertruck eventually. It's just far cheaper to drive with electricity.On the manufacturing issues, it looks like they keep improving with their newer factories. China reportedly has far better quality since they designed the plant around the production line. I view Fremont as an operations nightmare. They are doing the best they can with the facility, but they designed the manufacturing around the building which can lead to far more issues than fine tuned process designed from the ground up.
The competition is coming. Jesus where have I heard it before.  Oh right. Right here for the last 10 years. If you haven't heard, GM is recalling every single Bolt (original Model 3 killer) they made between 2017-2019 due to fire risk and the battery packs have to be replaced. Battery is the constraint in EV and GM has to allocate 60000 battery packs to the old cars rather than put them in new vehicles. Very smart engineering. Mach E has entered intonfull production since late last year and so far they have delivered fewer than 20,000 worldwide in the first 6 months (compared to 400,000 Model 3 and Y). They couldn't mass produce more than a fraction of what Tesla can. Lightning F150 is going to need so many battery cells that F150 EV will be a low volume truck, just like the Mach E. Credit to Ford because Mach E and F150 Lightning doesn't suck. VW ID 3 and 4 sales are abysmal in China and they are sounding alarm because the tech in them just suck compared to XPeng and other Chinese brands, let alone Tesla's. E-Tron, EQC and Ipace are nowhere to be found. Hyundai Kona EV has been recalled numerous times due to fire risks. In Erope, despite extra shipping and 10% import duty, Model 3 is the top selling EV. What would happen when Berlin starts pumping out Model Y by the end of this year?And in US Tesla STILL has 70% marketshare. Model Y price went up $5k in the last 6 months and it's sold out until November. So tell me, where and when is this real competition coming?
I grew up in a similar situation and I totally get where you're coming from. Quick warning: this is going to be a long comment walking you through a really basic explanation of investing that can hopefully help you look at it a little differently. I think it's really common for people who don't know anything about investing to think of it as gambling with extra steps. So, like any form of gambling, *you shouldn't invest more than you're willing to lose.* You only invest $10K if you can handle that $10K disappearing forever. But that's not really the right metaphor. The question you should be asking yourself before you invest is: **how much money would I be OK *not using* for several years if I had to?**First off, this advice assumes you invest in something called an index fund, *not* an individual company's stock. If you invest all your money in something like Tesla, it's technically possible that Tesla could go bankrupt and you lose all the money you invested. That's the scenario many people imagine when they think about investing.**But if you invest in an index fund, you're buying a bit of stock in every company in a particular market.** Instead of Tesla, let's say you put that $10K in VTI, an index fund from Vanguard that invests your money in the entire S&ampP 500 stock market (there are several stock markets, btw, but this one is popular). In order for you to lose that $10K, every single company in that market would have to go bankrupt. If that happens, it's probably because the revolution has already started, money is now worthless, and you have more important things to worry about.So what *can* go wrong when you invest in index funds? The price can drop, and in the worst case scenario it can stay low for many years. However, the price *will go back up* at some point, and **you only lose money if you actually sell the fund at a low price**. **An example:** Let's say you invest $10K at the beginning of 2007. Then boom! A few months later there's a huge stock market crash. If it's really bad, your $10K fund might now be worth $5K (which is a *huge* drop, like worse case scenario). **If you need some of that money right now and you have to sell some of that fund, that sucks.** Let's say you sell $1K worth of the fund (which was worth $2K when you bought it) to pay for an unexpected car repair, you just lost $1000 of your original investment. Or let's say you've lost all other sources of income, spent all your savings, and you need the $5000 now to pay rent and eat. You sell at $5K, losing $5K of your initial investment. **But let's say instead you don't need the invested money right away.** You can leave it there for 5, 6, 7+ years because you have a job and cash savings to get you through any unexpected expenses. If that's the case, then the price bounces back. In 2015, you're $10K fund is more like $15K-$20K. Those are completely made up numbers, but people who didn't have to sell during the 2007-08 crash ended up making lots of money off those investments a few years later. **TLDR: Try thinking about investing money as a risk that you can't touch it for a long time, not a risk that it will disappear forever if the market crashes.**
I didn't say lucid was the only car company to use 900 im just saying its a plus over tesla. Btw I invested in tesla way back in the day at around $50 a share prior to the 5 to 1 split and haters like you scoffed. If you don't want to invest in lucid your loss. Clearly people want the car or they wouldn't have 10,000 plus pre-orders.
From people actually in the AI space, we are still years away from any form of real self driving. Also, any tesla already sold with ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù capabilities will need more than just a software update to work. IE: a different car
Holding &gt1000 shares since 2018. Drive a Model 3 with FSD.This is the best resource for Tesla near term projections. https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/near-future-quarterly-financial-projections.116065/page-223This is a post by a guy who has been spot on modeling Tesla's growth for years. Here's his latest 5 year projection. https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-valuation-based-on-5-year-outlook.234307/#post-5723319
I see so many new Tesla‚Äôs in my city, literally can‚Äôt go a day without seeing a Tesla, 3 Tesla owners live in my building too. They‚Äôre really seeing a surge in demand
Yeah. Unless their profit margins go up substantially I expect this year to be mostly flat. FSD wide scale release or production ramping up quickly at the new factories are the main catalysts I expect. Still had lots more potential questions to ask. Where will be the next plant? Will they be able to sell cars in India without massive taxes? would they wait until the compact car to expand there? How much harder would FSD be in India? One thing I think Tesla should focus on more than solar roofs would be mass producing solar powered carports. Those would be far easier to install at scale to back up the megapacks, and could be used with stadiums and parking lots. We have so much wasted space in the USA with parking lots that just absorb heat. That would bring value and shade to parking lots.
If Rivian is raising money at a 70B valuation then LCID is worth at least that. These are the two pure EV companies that can finally compete with Tesla.
For all the people that don't do dd . Peter Rawlings the CEO of Lucid is the man who brought the model s to market for Tesla.  Gl to all !!!
Lucid is the real deal and is currently undervalued especially compared to a lot of its peers.Lucid was a company long before they decided to make a car. They made powertrains and batteries and had a very good reputation. The people at the top worked in high positions at some of the biggest car companies in the world. A lot of these guys are perfectionists who wont cut corners and will push to crrate the best vehicles possible.And the tech speaks for itself. EV experts were shocked at what the Air can do and they assumed the battery would be much large than it actually was. Tesla and Lucid are like a half decade to a decade ahead of the regular car companies on EV tech. For tech, thats a huge lead.Stocks atent about wait till something sky rockets and get in, stocks are about getting in before it rises. So if you waiting for sales numbers or a bunch of Lucid's on the road, you are too late.Like I said, Lucid at this price is undervalued. There are l3ss attractive EV companies looking to ipo at 80 bil who dont gave the tecg, dont have giga factories and dealerships made, who dont have the reputation or people behind it, etc.
For all the people who don't do their dd the people involved with this company started in Formula E over 8 years ago . They aren't gonna put out some crapper to go against Tesla.  In fact Tesla won't be the major player anymore Lucid will be competing with Mercedes and Audi . Formula E
The DD reveals a company that was founded just a few years after Tesla yet has never delivered a single car...
Man, Tesla can really go either way so I‚Äôm not touching it. I‚Äôm buying puts on most of these but hella calls on UPS and FedEx even though I don‚Äôt see it on the list but if one runs the other will too. Calls on 3M too.
Let‚Äôs see these Tesla earnings, shall we
Considering Apple and Tesla both have massive operations in China and are dependent upon China for much of their growth...How come no one seems concerned about Chinese intervention in these companies?At least as far as their operations in China are concerned?
GM recalling 69k cars due to fire concerns, where are the headlines and articles? Where is the media outrage? Tesla had 1 car catch on fire and its all they talked about for a week
I will always upvote a Tesla yolo cause time decay can be staggeringly brutal on this ticker.
He fucking gets loans against his shares to buy even more shares so while I can criticize him for a lot of stupid shit I can‚Äôt say that he isn‚Äôt ride or die with Tesla. Guys about as degen as a billionaire can be lol
If it hits 515 by monday I'll buy you a tesla. Literally.
I remember saying that about Tesla at $180 pre split
Run Tesla, Run
Always remember Elon's tweet: Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in, it will be the last out.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/342107352041922560?s=18
You know people bitch a lot about Tesla full self driving not truly being full self driving right now. Meanwhile subway has a 10 inch sandwich they called a foot-long but nobody said shit. This is why this country is going down the drain.
That and Tesla has been squeezed into a huge inflection point by the lower 1 yr sup and 1yr upper resistance. This thing is going to move in a huge way, Tesla hiring more employees due to increased demand and my folks buying their own Tesla tell me faith is still in musk. That being said getting cucked is still on the menu.
He's playing earnings. Pretty decent move considering Tesla tends to move in a big way just prior to earnings and in a bigger way just after. He could close on a gain into earnings or get bailed out of a fail coming out. "YOLO" just depends on whether he spray painted chrome into his mouth doing it.
Can‚Äôt get a new tesla for 3 monthsEven showrooms are all sold out. They even shipped the demo frame of a model 3 back to build a car or some shitUsed teslas selling at the same price as brand newThese guys r killing it
I'm invested in Nio and from all research I have done about the company I believe that they will become the strongest competitor for Tesla. However: the Chinese government's recent actions to limit the power of their companies adds some uncertainty to this otherwise very positive outlook. Some say those regulations will make the companies only stronger because the investments will be more stable. Others discuss that China might try to take their companies off international markets in the long run. So I'm gonna stay invested because I still expect great growth, but I think that Nio isn't the no-brainer investment anymore that it was when I started investing. So keep your eyes on the news if you jump aboard!
People who work for Musk are more into the prestige of the company than their personal compensation. SpaceX and Tesla are terrible places to work for anything other than just to say ‚ÄúI helped build that‚Äù.The sad part is that the prestige angle really only matters to a small group of people. It‚Äôs not even that big a boast in the real world, since what a lot of people hear is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind being exploited‚Äù. Working for Lockheed or NASA is just as prestigious at much better pay.
You toss and turn as Elon gently rubs your shoulders. "You seem a little tense" says Elon, as you look at your bank account. Your phone shows $107 left to your name.You think to yourself while Elon rubs you down, you pull open Robin Hood, type in TSLA. Leaps $900 JAN 2023' are only $1 you can afford 1 leap. This is finally your chance to get rich, you'll be able to actually buy a Tesla. You ask Elon what the next Tesla will be.He says "U, for 'you'" as he smiles sweetly. You picture him dancing on stage explaining U S3XY to everyone multiple times as you smile back at him.All of a sudden Elon flips on the TV to CNBC to catch the tail end of Jim Cramer, you see a new law has been passed, "we believe options have inflated the markets into a bubble, we will be imposing a new rule next week only allowing accounts that qualify for day trades to also purchase options with a $25,000 barrier to entry."You start weeping aloud, you feel a caring hand wipe your tear away, it's Elon again, "what's wrong my little X'‚àöœÄ3?"Suddenly you wake, you're in a pool of sweat, at first you panic about the new options policy, then you're filled with relief realizing that options aren't restricted it was all a dream.You realize this was actually a vision to earn 200,000% gains to buy a TSLA leap. You log into RH, it welcomes you with your $107 balance, you plug in TSLA yolo 2023 @ $900 and realize the options are actually $20 each. The best you can do is $900 TSLA weekly expiring around Christmas.In a slight fit of despair you try to remember the feeling of Elon rubbing your cheek, and rub one out onto your stomach, then roll over back to sleep. A single tear rolls from your eye into your waifu pillow.YOLO you whisper.
Maxwell had two major clusters of patents. One cluster for super advanced ultracapacitors, and a cluster for dry electrode cell lithium batteries. Dry electrodes save about 80% of the steps in making a battery and save more than half the drying and curing time, with a huge impact on the cost of battery factories, and about a 20% reduction in the per battery cost, all while improving power and energy density. They got the part they wanted and sold the super caps back to someone who wants to run with it. Neither bearish nor bullish IMO, just pragmatic. Tesla having those very futuristic 4180 cells being made in 3 or 4 factories is a pretty bullish sign though.
I miss tesla +\-50 days. Now it‚Äôs just a boring stock
Seriously Tesla just make the stock go up already. Fucks sakes
According to options profit calculator:Breakevens at expiry: $710.20Max Loss: $600,475 as pictured in the photoMax Gain (lets say tesla runs up to at most $800/share next week friday): $4.4 millionProbability of profit: 15.6%Godspeed to you OP but this isn't looking good
Fortunately for Tesla a good portion of their costumers are absolute retards.
https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/push-supply-tesla-piedmont-lithium-irks-north-carolina-neighbors-2021-07-20/Looks like they are not producing in a welcoming neighbourhood.
Tesla and its pipe dream are wildly over valued and laughable. Therefore it will go up
Who in the fuck is spending $200/month for FSD?  How much time do you spend in your cars?  My daily (not tesla) holds the lane, adaptive cruise control, and does auto lane changes and was maybe a $1500 option out the door.   It will auto park and will back out of my driveway without any assistance ( as long as I‚Äôm in the car) and It‚Äôs less finicky than Tesla‚Äôs software.
How was Tesla worth $880B at one point earlier this year? Speculative buying mixed with a short &amp multiple gamma squeezes. Will the same thing happen to GME? Let‚Äôs kick it back and find out üëÄ
"In March, Electrek exclusively reported that Tesla was building a production line for the Tesla Semi at a new building near Gigafactory Nevada to produce five Tesla Semi electric trucks per week by the end of the year."5 trucks a week? wow that's what I call mass producing
They doing something with Tesla, esp. with regard to battery production?I need a *CATALYST*.Tell me they're sticking their corporate treasury into bitcon or something.
Plot Twist Elon shoots down Bazos rocket with Lazers from Star Link and Becomes the most Legendary Super Villain of all Time.  Calls on Tesla Puts on Amazon
Silly wabbit. It‚Äôs been Bezos‚Äôs plan all along to publicly ‚Äúexplode‚Äù when exiting our atmosphere. He‚Äôs already uploaded his consciousness to AWS and will soon use all of his micro-satellites that‚Äôll shoot off from his human-form to gain control over this planet. It‚Äôs the primary reason why Elon wants out from earth - he doesn‚Äôt want Jeffrey all up in his Tesla grill.
holy fuck someone just dropped 1.2 million dollars on tesla 7/30 $650 calls.    oh fuckkkkk
If spy craters 50% I can't see a scenario where Tesla does better than that
Assets under management can move price if the index follows a strategy. Vanguard's VIGAX, for example, is a large cap growth fund with $165.6 Billion under management. It will ignore value companies and small caps, but continue to pump up prices of large cap growth companies such as Tesla.When index funds have inflows, there is trading that occurs that can drive up prices as they buy and hold more and more companies with high market caps.
I put my last 5k into Tesla 650 fds If I‚Äôm gonna go out might as well do it retardly
Correct. Tesla rear view mirror shows a hundred less expensive model gaining.
Incorrect DD leading to fanboy conclusion.  Reality Tesla Deliveries pushed back due to supply chain constraints and inability to source parts. Can‚Äôt build or deliver cars if parts don‚Äôt show up.
There's an extremely high chance you wouldn't be retired because you had sold all or most of it when it was up 50-100% in this alternate reality. I had a number of shares of Tesla, kept flipping them between 170-350 and it worked well for a while as it kept bouncing off that wall...Until it didn't, and it just kept going for a long time. That was pre 5 for 1 split...Yeah that hurts lol. Would have bought me a new Tesla already. But goes to show that the whole genre of "if only I bought X in Y year I'd be retired by now" doesn't include the strong phycology of being up 100, 500, even 1000%, most people won't hold a single stock while up so big until the point it could retire them.
I did that too.... wanted tesla (before their fist car), Amazon (when they were just selling books) , Netflix (when they delivered discs), (Bitcoin at $210) and Moller (well they still don‚Äôt have a flying car, and they never will). Never had money that I could afford to lose at those times so I didn‚Äôt buy in.Now I have money to buy in but have no clue what to buy......pfft.
Yeah I wish I bought tesla when I put it on my watch list in 2013 .. same with. Netflix. I would have been retired by now.
High school economics teacher here. My students come into my class with all kinds of opinions on financial markets. The goal (as a teacher, so take this with a grain of salt) is to demystify investing for them. The idea that it's the same as a casino comes from ignorance of both how casinos work and how the stock market works. Sure, you win some and lose some, but it's not random numbers, and buying Tesla stock is not betting on black. In particular, when you're talking about something as broad as the S&ampP and not individual stocks, I underscore why diversification in investments helps pad losses when some companies do eventually fold.A lot of animosity toward "investors," be that the guys on Wall St. or Joe Schmo retail with a Robinhood account and 5 shares of $F, comes from populist thinking. It's the "that's how rich people stay rich," and it's not for us because  Some of my students are absolutely astounded at the ease of making trades and watching their accounts move up and down when I have them buy stocks on Wealthbase (killer resource for teachers, by the way!), a paper trading app I use in my class. I see the self-efficacy about investing form. It's the, "I can do this. It's not hard!" For those worried, by the way, I teach the efficient market hypothesis too and our benchmark as "money managers" in the game is to beat the S&ampP, not each other.All told, what I'm getting at is that just like politics -- there isn't a clear-cut way to tell people that you think they're wrong about the purpose of the stock market and investing. I have an advantage because the teenagers I teach are captive at school and I have a position of authority there as a teacher. With regular folks that I meet, I rarely can explain that away.What others have said here really works: just let them live in that world. If you explain it to your best ability and they don't "switch sides" or whatever, that's what it is. If they want to know more eventually, they know they can ask you. Otherwise, it just is what it is.
I lost like half my account last year. Bought into Tesla heavy when they announced split believing it would go up because the stock was hot and the per share price would go down bring in some retail investors. Made all my money back, sold it because if I just held I'd be doing capital loss carry over forever. Spent a week thinking about things and planning because I was nearly 100% cash after the sale, and had the opportunity to start from scratch and change my investments. Decided with the way the world was going Tesla was still a good bet. Got lucky twice Bought some Tesla $420C for June 2021 two weeks later the S&ampP 500 announcement came out and in 3 weeks I made 250% considered selling at that price but didnt set a market order- decided to watch it the next day. It dropped and usually recovered- this time it didnt. Sold 2 days later for 150% gain. At Christmas I bought 100 shares on margin around $645. Sold a call against them for Jan 9 $800C a 30% move, figured. If It doesn't hit I make $500 and sell another. Someday one will hit and I'll have made premiums on the ones that didnt, and when it does, I'll get more than I paid for them, pay back the margin ad keep the difference. It HIT cashed out and made 12,000 the first week of January. Figuring there was little reason for Tesla to go down I put the cash into more stock, moved most of my savings too. It went into from 900s to mid $500s and has been range bound in the $600s now for months.  I lost all the money I made in 2020 and most of my savings too. :( I know it will all come back eventually but yeah.... so far I'm hoping 2021 ends the way 2020 did.
AI is just casually thrown around nowadays. Tesla is AI. NVDA is AI. AI AI AI wowzers so much future n stuff. most people don't even know what AI is.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get how you are so obsessed with stocks.‚ÄùI start driving a Tesla‚ÄúCan you tell me about some stocks.‚Äù

The biggest car company in the world, VWAG, is heavily invested in QS and I would assume that they buy the shit out of them once QS gets a working battery at scale. And trusting their published specs they are the closest to one of all competitors.Also JB Straubel (the person who made Tesla great) is on the board. If he is in, I am in.
i loaded up on some RDS/B on this dip. Oil stocks are fairly undervalued with crude oil prices holding up well. The market seems to believe tesla will magically rid the world of oil and gas in 3-5 years or something rediculous. The reality is most cars on the road will be oil driven for at least another 10 years, and that is enough to make oil a good investment here.
Tesla is not a short-term play, at least, not at $800. It's a stock you should plan to hold for 10+ years. In 2030, $800 will look cheap, but it could do anything in the next few years. I can see it going over $1000 or back to $200 in the next year. Doesn't matter to me since I'm long.
Somebody get this bot.Your name doesn't match your actions. You're in for 153k in $CLOV but didnt think that money wasnt better spent in tesla? Last time you posted about tesla was in june 2020? You're telling me you didnt post once in the ramp up from 890-2500? Fake account. Good to see your in amc as well posting. I'll be sure to screenshot this b.s. for confirmation bias of shitty bots and bought accounts. Try harder shills.
Reddit isn't a joke nor is/are the other market participants.This is the beauty of a free market. Every participant gets to decide which companies they want to invest in. People who invested in Tesla clearly believes in the company and its potential. Those who choose not to invest in Tesla clearly don't believe in its potential.There are bulls and bears for every investment and only time will tell who will be proven right. Both bulls and bears stubbornly hold strong conviction in their decision and both try to call each side as a joke.I think this game of tug of war kind of discussion is healthy and is part of the beauty of the free market.Good luck with your investments. I don't own Tesla but I do indirectly since I am 100% in SPY.
The risks of investing in Tesla only exist if you have a short time horizon. Over enough time, Musk will cause politicians to steer trillions of dollars into infrastructure projects like the Boring company. The need for batteries to buffer the demand that electric vehicles will put on the electric grid will be trillions more. Tesla will be given sweetheart deals to build the vehicles that will run in those tunnels.Starlink will supply Tesla vehicles with massive data speeds to allow them to navigate around traffic jams, and essentially operate as one large, intelligent swarm of vehicles - able to work together to help each other be more efficient. Letting each other merge, change lanes, etc all with the superintelligent thinking only AI could come up with. Your FSD car will be changing lanes for reasons that don't make sense until 5 minutes after you've made your way through a gridlock of non-AI vehicles. Not having FSD will be like not having a cellphone. You can live your life like that, but you'd be a fool if you did.Any country that doesn't participate in the scheme that he has in mind will find itself being left behind by countries that do participate. He is literally the type of visionary that Henry Ford and Thomas Edison were - except more so.However much money it's going to take to put people on Mars - Musk will make Tesla earn it. Tesla is Musk's bitch and Tesla is going to suck the cock of global economy until it hands over every nickle.
Risks of investing in tesla? Can‚Äôt think of many, anyone please let me know
So I was going 15 over the speed limit today and next thing I know a unmarked cop car is behind me with the sirens going off. I switch lanes and he proceeds to pull over the Tesla I was keeping pace with. Tesla calls it is boys
Thanks for sharing! That was interesting to read. Sounds like GM is making OK progress! But not a single thing in that article makes me think GM is ahead in self-driving, or even close to Tesla.The author mostly prefers GM because he thinks they‚Äôre handling the human driver/safety piece of autonomous driving better, which - agree or disagree - doesn‚Äôt really have to do with how good their self driving tech is.Further, GM is taking a similar approach to Waymo - extensively map out and learn small geo‚Äôs of roads and then prep your cars for those. Nothing about their tech is general purpose - they haven‚Äôt even OK‚Äôd it for anything other than a few highways!Plus their data collection (which is the name of the game in self driving) is literally miles behind Tesla‚Äôs.This to me is bullish for Tesla. Happy to be corrected if I missed (or misread) something though.
Ayee Tesla LETS GOOOOOOOOO been a while since I saw TSLA posts here!
TM(Toyota) and VWAPY/POAHY. Everyone wants to get into the EV space, and that is great. Everyone is also investing in companies like Workhorse, NIO and Lucid. I‚Äôm going the other way and investing in the legacies. They have the economy of scale, plus Toyota has partnered with Tesla. It‚Äôs fun to that that NIO or Lucid could be the next Tesla. But, we sometimes forget that the old dogs have the advantage of brand loyalty and economy of scale.
Earnings are a week from Monday. TSLA usually runs up to earnings. But the big news is Tesla launched its subscription FSD service sometime last night. This is expected to bring in millions in high margin revenue. Wall Street loves them some recurring revenues and Saas (software as a service). üöÄüöÄ
These are the kids who got pushed into lockers and silently simmered in their parents‚Äô basement innovating based on that burning motivation to one day be successful enough to drive up to a gas station in a Tesla and watch as the jock plugs their car into the supercharger!!These days because bullying is frowned upon we lose that nerd motivation. Bullies are essential to long-run innovation. Bring back bullies better!!!
Well assuming that this is all true and then assuming that individual investors can stop from falling into the same traps that professionals do (buying Tesla at the high cuz FOMO). Then sure it‚Äôs possible to beat the market. Sad thing is‚Ä¶ this simply isn‚Äôt true based on the data we have about retail investors. And often, retail investors perform worse than fund managers do because they get scared and run during dips or simply just make terrible stock picks.
Bruh the cfo and other executives dumped all their shares after the original meme pump. Sold between 12-13.Does that seem like the behavior of someone that thinks their company is the next tesla?
Just hold. You will be fine. I‚Äôm buying more every month When this becomes the new Tesla stock, you will be bathing in cash
I'm bullish on ford, but you can't draw fundamental comparisons between ford and Tesla, they are not similar enough.  Comparison to GM would be more appropriate.

and let the gas crowd win? no thank you. buy a tesla.
Tesla started in 2003 and didn‚Äôt release the Model S until 2012. Sooo‚Ä¶.
Careful it is the Tesla killer.
Tesla is a 10 Trillion dollar company? I own shares, I own a model x, and that is fucking absurd
Tesla To the moon
Thank god nobody buys those things or else GM would be in trouble. The only reason i even clicked this post was cuz it said Tesla.
If it were Tesla ‚ÄúTesla claims they intentionally murder people with cars that cause house fires‚Äù
You believe Tesla is worth $700 billion? That‚Äôs pricing in 15 million vehicles sold annually lol. Do you think Tesla can sell 15 million cars a year and generate $500 billion in revenue? Yeah‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt either.
The rebalancing question is really the heart of the challenge.I bought $40k worth of Tesla when it was trading at $26. I sold half when it hit $40, and the rest at ~$70.Today the split-adjusted price hovers around $3300. That's over $5M if I had just held.Note that I think TSLA is grossly overrated now and I'm down lifetime on TSLA due to shorts. RIP
Tesla will be $1800 before you die.
üòÇlol are u serious ?, every company with a considerable sp drop has to dealWith these ‚Äúclass action fraud claims‚Äù , with Tesla it happened the exact same , they went on 500-1000% increase within mere moments from that point.

The CEO said in his tweet that‚Äôs he‚Äôs not allowed to say anything about timing or partnerships until it‚Äôs public.I believe Samsung is a confirmed partner. Samsung is providing cameras to Tesla. MMAT is working on components needed for autonomous driving like defogging cameras. Just some dots that may or may not connect. Company is undervalued indeed
I won't touch them. I don't even like American/International companies that do a significant amount of their business with China, or are heavily pursing a presence there. Tesla isn't even on my radar anymore after Elon's recent CCP bootlicking. I'm sure the CCP is having one hell of a time stealing his technology.
Yeah. Honestly I‚Äôm a noob who started when covid hit and got lucky with Tesla and plug. I found this sub because of the gme thing but I can understand how it is annoying. MVIS is interesting though so I encourage you to look into their patents and tech. Good luck to you and all your investments my friend ü§ô
You must have been a Tesla bear from 2011 till current day. Too bad.
800 strike on GME? 1700 on tesla? The rest? Please tell me you are joking? You bet Tesla was going to go up more than $1000 by Friday? Are you insane?This has to be trolling. All of these are impossible strikes.

Tesla is gonna fuck this shit out of bears tomorrow
Should have never been caught int he hype and bought BB at $21. Now instead of buying a Tesla i have to keep driving my old Toyota :(
HOLY MOLY someone just spent 1 mil on Tesla Jun 2023 1200C Fucking send it üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I learned from Tesla that When I‚Äôm absolutely sure a stock is going up, it always goes the other way.
More or less indefinitely. It will surely be eventful as there's all kinds of micro-bubbles like meme stocks, green energy, meme currencies, and entertainment industries who haven't recovered from Covid.Understand, though, the economy actually slightly grew in 2020. Most industries are either essential or had the ability to telework, so when the market rebounded it went back to fair value.Actually a little above fair value because Tesla is on the S&ampP 500.
did Elon just say the n word in court Tesla boys not happy
Tesla carrying SPY harder than Jose‚Äôs at the construction site.
Yeah, no. That's not going to happen. The same exact logic can apply to Elon. Elon is more likely to be caught in the geopolitical crosshairs than anyone at NIO. Chinese know how to play the political game, Foreigners don't. Elon is a fucking tool that doesn't know how to placate the CCP. NIO does, and literally did. There's a reason the Hefei Government bailed them out: because they know how to play the game.You think the Chinese Government is going to bailout Tesla if they run into trouble? No. Absolutely not.
Random, but also important: Hefei Government is invested in NIO. The local Hefei Government is trying to groom NIO as their local brand. As someone who lives in Hefei, I can attest to the fact that the Hefei Government is not going to let NIO Fail and if push comes to shove will have favorable government policy support. Anecdotally, I've seen more XPeng, Wuling, and NIO, rather than Tesla in Hefei. I have absolutely no idea why Tesla is so hyped. Tesla has almost no competitive advantage in China and is facing stiff headwinds.
Playing earnings is usually a gamble. The safest way is the run up to earnings (if you notice one starting) but a lot of times the price action right after earnings isnt predictable. I've seen Netflix dump on great earnings multiple times and have also seen Tesla rip face on bad earnings.

Tesla taking us to mars baby! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Fuck you Elon, this is my second time finding you on reddit and I have yet to receive my Tesla X!
Neither did tesla....
Or it can be the Tesla of space not make sense and make u a shit ton of money, Sometimes it‚Äôs not about fundamentals. I truly believe you are underestimating the amount of rich people there are in this world
I remember when Branson said he would take passengers to space back before Tesla and Amazon even existed, also before few of you were born. People thought he was a maniac because that idea was so unfathomable. Today he did what he said he would do. Absolutely insane to think about.
Meanwhile, Elon's Tesla is zooming through our solar system just for shits and giggles.
You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúafford a Tesla‚Äù‚Ä¶you only need rates low enough to buy one for $299/month.
You‚Äôre conflating share price with total value or profit. Tesla could do a reverse split and it‚Äôs share price would be $6,000+ each. Would that change anything about their business? No. Your analysis is dumb because your foundational understanding of the market is extremely incorrect.
I‚Äôve had these same thoughts for awhile. For Tesla to really breakout they need to cater to the average person while still maintaining quality. Like you said the average person can‚Äôt afford a Tesla, hell the average person can‚Äôt afford the car they are driving now lol. If Tesla *successfully* makes a cheaper vehicle, then the sky is the limit
For Tesla shares to hit hit $1500+ I think Tesla would need to start producing more ‚Äúbudget‚Äù vehicles. With these giant companies like amazon at 3000+ a share, they all have one thing in common, and that is that they all cater to the massive majority in the world. With their cheapest vehicle being over 35k dollars, not a lot of people can afford the products they produce and with the stocks exceeding 600 a share, they are getting more and more difficult for people to buy. Tesla only caters to the top of the middle class and above. Imagine Tesla coming out with an affordable version of their cars with limited access to the luxuries of even a model 3, I would still buy the shit out of it. For electric vehicles to take over, the population would actually have to afford it. I also think since Tesla cars are, in the bigger picture, ‚Äúnewer‚Äù we will start to a lot of resells in the future, and maybe then will I think Tesla could go above the stated price. But as of right now I don‚Äôt see Tesla being anything more than a hype stock that a lot of people buy into with out research. With that being said I am holding a single Tesla stock for savings reasons lol. It‚Äôs definitely a sketchy buy in my opinion
So you've either lost 19k (paid weekly the amount invested would be 104k) which being wsb I can see this one. Or you made 33k (biweekly pay would be 52k invested), or made 61k (monthly pay would be 24k invested, really nice if this is the case). Regardless, just straight investing in s&ampp500 for 5 years would have been higher returns. Or Tesla would have 14x'd it
I‚Äôm aware ‚Ä¶. Lol if you play earnings you gotta play something like Nike or upstart or Tesla not bugle boy jeans
Lol a million meme stocks to choose from and you pick a boring ass jeans stock . Congrats retard . If it makes you feel better I seen someone post a $30k Tesla yolo yesterday expiring today that went to $0
ya, I think OP is overestimating Didi's influence in this case. Just look at Tesla, the whole EV space didn't really do well in the last couple of days

For what it‚Äôs worth. Here are my thoughts on __TSLA.__There is too much apprehension regarding how big of a loss they‚Äôll have to report on their BTC holdings since they have to report the lowest price over the quarter. This ultimately has 0 impact on Tesla fundamentally and my guess is that until the headline risk is off the table (after they report), the stock will not breakout above 700. That being said, as soon as they report, no matter how bad it is, the risk will be off the table and the market will buy the news as they have already sold the rumor. Plus if you‚Äôre bullish and patient, you get to wait for the IV drop after earnings as well üòâ. Edit: fuk. üö®here comes VMüö®
This exactly. If you bought Tesla at ATH, you'll probably have to wait a similar time if not longer, if you ever see it at that price again.
I once again am inducting u/doctorhomage newer account but he loves FDs, man threw 30k on 0dte tesla calls today
Hasn't both of these happened? Tesla (bricked), and... I wanna say jeep (hacked)?
THIS is some fuckin Chad on jack Daniel's coke and Xanax level shit right here.  1 dte 30k tesla yolo... FINALLY this fuckin sub is getting its shit together.   Don't let em put you down bro.   They just jelly there balls and bank accounts aren't like yours.   Godspeed brother.
Ah the old Tesla trick, I‚Äôm something of a magician myself. I make money disappear
Ok say the SPCE  flight goes  well it won‚Äôt be a sell the news because you have bezos the following week and it will just melt up going into that flight There is a lot of money to be made on the stock and u can call me crazy I think this. Is a Tesla 2.0 in the making
Tesla FSD is shady marketing.You literally believe Tesla has this capability ü§∑Level 5 (Full Driving Automation)Level 5 vehicles do not require human attention‚Äïthe ‚Äúdynamic driving task‚Äù is eliminated. Level 5 cars won't even have steering wheels or acceleration/braking pedals. They will be free from geofencing, able to go anywhere and do anything that an experienced human driver can do.
So do I put all my money in Domino's or Tesla?
Mr. Krabs woke up pissed the fuck off about his $AAPL $147 strike calls for July 16th. I was seriously going to sell this morning and buy $SPY puts and more $PLTR puts. Keep this in mind everyone - if the $SPY fell to $429 twice this week, don't be surprised if we touch $425 tomorrow. I'd wait till around 2:00 before buying shit. And then see how tomorrow afternoon goes. Too much instability after a fall like that. Bears are licking their lips, loving the fear, and want that $425. If Tesla touches $590, I'm in for calls. Also eyeing $NVDA. $SPCE calls are a go. $X calls are a go. $SOFI puts are a go.Everything else is questionable.
Tesla just dropped the price of model y by 10k üêÇ as fuck
Tesla a few years ago - EV's, green energy, self driving carsMore recently I've invested in gene editing companies like Intellia, Crispr Tx, Editas, and Beam. It's honestly hard to overstate just how much gene editing will change humanity in the coming decades and centuries. Outside of maybe AI there's nothing else that will have as profound an impact.Pretty much all diseases will get cured and everyone will be super human. Dying from diseases or old age will become a thing of the past.
No, you need a disk to receive Starlink, this isn't in their wheelhouse nor will they be able to do the same thing.What I would describe it as just because there is Tesla doesn't mean there isn't Ferrari
No matter how you try to spin it, Tesla makes no fucking sense. Basically a precursor to AMC and GameStop.
I couldn't agree more.People don't appreciate Tesla's level of vertical integration in my opinion.Amazon's cash cow, AWS was invented out of necessity to provide their services.Tesla keeps creating solutions for their own problems which few have the capital and concentration of expertise and execution power to achieve.For example, they're building out enormous computing power in their Dojo project to train their AI which once online could be offered as a service.They needed specialty processing for full self-driving so they developed their own silicon.They make their own seats in-house.  Most automotive companies use suppliers for this and other major parts of the car.  To me, if Tesla is an automotive manufacturer, then other companies are just assemblers.        They need more battery capacity so they're building out their own infrastructure to supplement suppliers.When faced with a problem, they don't just try to throw money at it, they invent solutions in-house and capture that value.
I wrote the following two comments regarding TSLA in another thread:‚ÄúTrying to do a DCF on Elon‚Äôs ability to move markets is impossible.Tesla is overvalued by every metric and common sense.  However you cannot put a price on a brilliant Chairman who can move markets with a simple tweet.A lot of the hype is centered around full self driving being a thing and Tesla being the leader in fully autonomous driving. Full self driving is a week away every other week.. for years now. At what point does the user base accept reality?  Plenty of complaints from owners that they can‚Äôt transfer the FSD purchase to future models - so is it a software license purchase, or hardware?  When does that lawsuit come to fruition?  When do governments clamp down on the use of self driving and it‚Äôs limitations?Here‚Äôs the thing - how much has been priced into the stock where FSD fails to be a complete product?  What if it‚Äôs never fully self driving like we‚Äôve been led on to believe?  *what if customers don‚Äôt actually want a car that drives itself because they don‚Äôt like nanny tech?* - how much of that has been priced in?Is it a car company?Is it a tech company?Is it a energy company?Is it a battery supply company?Here‚Äôs the thing tho.. if anyone questions the above and the stock tanks, elon simply tweets out ‚Äúso excited to work on our new, mid-sized pick up truck or convertible model 3.. expected soon!‚Äù  And the stock doubles in a few days - wiping out the shorts.That‚Äôs Tesla and Elon magic in a nutshell.‚Äù‚ÄúI agree with you that self driving tools are *helpful*, but I question the ambitions and real world practically of *full* self driving.Tesla has been pushing a narrative of being at the cusp of full self driving for years - Elon himself has been pumping the idea of FSD being ready for years now. Oct 2016: https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardwareMeanwhile in the real world, drivers (including myself) *are turning off autonomous features* : https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/drivers-turning-off-annoying-or-bothersome-vehicle-safety-systems.htmlNowhere am I insinuating that self driving is not useful or welcome, but rather to what degree?Problem is, even when there‚Äôs this big gaping hole of mis-pricing, as a fund manager you can‚Äôt take advantage of the opportunity because if the short-market moves against Tesla, a simple Tweet from Elon will move it right back and wipe you out - even if it‚Äôs 100% bullshit.‚Äù
Have you done any research into Ford or GM? General Motors is literally investing everything they have into electric vehicles, with numerous electric vehicles in the pipeline, and is planning to phase out gasoline cars completely within the next decade or two. Now that they are all in, with the kind of capital they have... its honestly only a matter of time. I wouldnt invest in Tesla right now honestly.Also GM China has like, the most popular electric vehicle available on the market iirc... More popular than Tesla.
tesla always disappointing..
Funny, mine are Biontech and Tesla. Soon probably Wish too.
I'll preface this by saying I have no view on Tesla. &gt Sooner or later it‚Äôll become like other Big Tech companies and all the former Tesla shorts will pretend it was obvious that building a position for the longterm was a good idea.It is easy to make analogies. Because it is a tech stock doesn't mean it goes to the moon. To re-cast a your analogy in a different light&gt Sooner or later it‚Äôll become like other Big Tech companies of the dot-com area and go to zeroPretending that you *know* the future to the degree you're representing it is.. well it's just incredibly silly.
&gtNo the agreement is not only will they have to buy shares in milestones but they have to purchase 500 million gallons of rng before they can buy shares at 13.49.Great point. I don't know what the price of RNG is, but if we assume $3/gal, that's $1.5billion in revenue before any shares are purchased. Now let's take a gander at the TTM revenue numbers of CLNE...they made just $282 million revenue over the past 12 months. In other words, Amazon would have to roughly 5x CLNE's annual revenues in the next 12 months in order to start buying any CLNE stock in the next year.Also note: I have not fact checked OP's statement here, but I hope it's true.Earnings in August I'm honestly expecting to be a nothing burger from a numbers perspective. Probably coming out to about break even or close to it (though ideally on the positive side). They will continue to expand their network and their production capacity. What I'm interested in is to see if they announce any new deals and if they give any more details on progress of existing deals. I'm hoping to see some signs of progress as we head towards the latter half of this year into next.Amazon isn't the be all end all, but it is a huge deal to expedite their vision. Hopefully CLNE will prove that RNG is a viable option for their long haul truck fleet over any of the other options they're looking at. Let's look at EV as an example...Tesla semi doesn't really exist yet, much less their mega chargers that supposedly can charge the battery to 400 miles in 30 minutes. Don't forget a semi's job is to haul a lot of weight. Batteries will cut into a significant portion of that weight capacity, limiting the potential revenue of the truck per load. Not to mention the cost of buying the truck + the cost of replacing the battery. EV car batteries might last \~10 years, but if we say a truck drives 400 miles a day and works 241 days (365 days - 104 weekend days because we'll assume trucks don't drive on weekends - 20 days vacation because we'll assume truck drivers take a month of vacation = 241), that's 80% of an EV car battery life (guessing 10yrs at avg 12k miles per year = 120k miles) in 1 year instead of 10. So...buy an EV truck for \~200k, replace battery in one year because range is getting tight...\~50k? (it's 10-15k to replace battery in a tesla car I think). 50k...that's 15k gallons of diesel (avg $3.25/gal), which is worth \~107k miles at 7mpg. Oh crap...I can drive more on diesel than I can on the COST of my EV truck battery, not including the cost of the electricity, the opportunity cost of the battery weight that I can't haul as revenue generating freight, or the opportunity cost of driving instead of waiting hours for my truck to charge.So...let's summarize the "value" proposition of an EV truck:* 200k initial cost* 50k annual battery replacement (total guess, but normal tesla car battery replacement runs around 15k on a random google search result, or about 33% of extended range model 3. 200k\*.3 = 60k - 10k to be conservative = 50k), which is already over 100k diesel miles before paying for charging.* ? cost of charging* opportunity cost of hauling 0 revenue battery instead of revenue generating freight* opportunity cost of spending potentially hours charging instead of hauling (400mi range/ 60mph = 6.67 hours driving of an 11hr limit in a 14hr period (Tesla has not proven the mega-charger 30 minute charge capability yet).* Avg trucker salary = .40 cents per mile (on the high end per google), which equates to roughly 62.4k per year if they work without vacations (again per google, not using any numbers from above...my math may not be as conservative as I thought).EDIT: I'm sure some number I used above is wrong...I didn't do any double checking...that's for you to do and down-vote me for being an idiot smooth brain donkey.
I bought tesla FDs because i saw they were -75% today so that means i can possibly only lose 25% tomorrow or +500%
Right on cue haha. Remind me, what does Tesla sell/ make their money from again? Anyone who think Tesla is anything but a car company at this point needs to do research. And remember guys, Elon/Tesla stated multiple times that they have basically solved FSD... 5 YEARS AGO. Lol. And the most recent crash out of China where the AP cannot read and turn on a sharp curve.... insane the lack of critism Elon/Tesla gets, and instead, deluded praise. Insane.
"Install solar" - can't wait for that Solar City court case starting just next week, obviously current negative GMs is surely a great reason for it to be valued at... oh $81bn according to MS?The issue (well one of - there are far far more - but that's for another day) with reference to Amazon / AWS, is that I don't have to spend $40k on Amazon before I can unlock the profitable AWS. Unfortunately that '$40k' comes with cost to Tesla, but it's ok sure some BTC sales and some EV credits make it profitable..Also, 5th largest supercomputer with 'several billion miles of highly detailed driving data'.... great ... and? Still no Robotaxis on the road (they're very late), still no viable FSD product, no regulatory agreement on using it.Oh quick question, in which country is that 5th largest supercomputer, where is the data being stored, how much of it has been agreed too, and more importantly, who is the US can access the China data? Oh actually, let's ask that question in reverse, who in China can access that US data, can China access AOC's detailed driving data for example?Obviously, no inter-country issues there..
For perspective, Tesla is trying to solve self-driving with computer vision. Every Tesla on the road has its software running in the background, feeding the 5th most powerful computer in the world. There, the AI is trained by comparing driver decisions to the decisions it would have made on its own.With each vehicle doubling as a data collection device, if any company out there is going to solve self-driving (if it is even possible), it is going to be Tesla. It's not going to be Waymo, nothing out of China, nothing out of Uber or Lyft, and certainly nothing from the traditional car manufacturers. The competition cannot match the sheer magnitude of data that Tesla has collected and continues to collect, and it will be done using only pure vision (cameras), and not with any LIDAR.
Yeah it‚Äôs for their autonomous driving work. The hilarious thing is that the current supercomputer is a precursor to their newer bigger computer (Dojo) that will take that work to the next level within the next year or so. No specific details on how big/powerful Dojo will be, but there are some articles on these topics:https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/tesla-detail-pre-dojo-supercomputer-could-be-up-to-80-petaflops/https://cleantechnica.com/2020/11/21/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-explained-how-to-make-full-self-driving-ai/
Sooner or later it‚Äôll become like other Big Tech companies and all the former Tesla shorts will pretend it was obvious that building a position for the longterm was a good idea.
To be fair, I took a lot of profits on feb21 $12 calls I bought back then‚Ä¶ bought my Tesla in cash üòÖ
Doing the same with $25 each week split into apple Amazon and Tesla. Also buy 1 msft a month and one VTI. Hoping to sell my AMC shares to spread out if it ever takes off again.
Tesla been producing cars for a long time, model x and s owners would have revolted if they had to buy battery packs every 2 to 3 years.Seems they lasting.However I doubt Fiat or Peugeot batteries would last more than 2 to 3 years.
JPM raised Tesla PT to $160!!!BULLISH
This shit. There is no way. People just don't get it yet like they didn't get Tesla. There is no way this isn't relevant.in the future
What's the difference between 5-8 and 10? Don't you think those numbers are arbitrary?And in case of Tesla, what changed since you bought? Are you investing for the medium-long term or short? If short... Why did you buy it during ATH...? If medium-long, I think short term ups &amp downs shouldn't bother you imo
Normally I'd agree but china 100% wants a competitor to Tesla.
First came coin. Then came Tesla. Then GameStop. Then amc. Mixed in was some weed stocks. Some other EV plays. There have been significant winners on this sub, consistently for the last few years. There will continue to be winners. People will continue to get rich quick here. No boomer investing advice necessary. Many will lose yes. No different than scratch offs. A lottery ticket that can change your life. You won‚Äôt convince people to play it safe. Playing it safe locks you into being a wage slave for the rest of your career waiting for compounding to do its thing. When you could have yolo‚Äôd Tesla and made 800% instead.
MeetKevin comes across really disingenuous he often talks about safe investment strategies while going heavy in on Tesla and Bitcoin, he constantly shills them, even his interviews for governor he shills it in there.He cannot be trusted in the slightest in my opinion
I‚Äôm not sure what the ‚Äúhyper‚Äù part of hyper libertarianism is. But what I can say is that he got lucky from the pandemic and Tesla which made him into a multi-millionaire. He also hates school and tells his audience that school isn‚Äôt necessary and no one should go into college because everything is available on the internet. All because he got a 2.0 gpa in highschool.I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt have to explain why everything he says is bs.
MeetKevin is a videopreneur like the vast majority of people making YouTube content the goal is maximizing view ($) not creating value. I used to watch some of his real estate content, on which he was somewhat knowledgeable given his main employment (doubt its still the main income source) as a RE agent so there were things to learn from his RE content. But you could literally see as an outsider that when he made his first stock and/or Tesla video (ideally both), it garnered a shit-ton more interest and within two weeks he forgot about real estate and made his Jim Cramer-like flashy setup. I don't blame him, I would do the same in his shoes (just get the money who cares), but it was clear he wasn't particularly knowledgeable (sorry Kevin) on the subject and he just went with the views, I expect it's the same path for most on the platform.
The legend of Joco the shrimp man, Bry drinks his piss if Spy closes green, Chinese dam puts, Microsoft 200, Tesla battery day There's a ton
all of them are questionable but tesla has Musk's cult that will buy anything he says and GME basically got taken over by new management, so they have some aspects that make the future less certain in a positive way.AMC is basically in a worse position than before with a ton of debt and their business hasn't really changed at all, but retards kept shorting it even though the company was on track stabilize, and then bigger, more retarded retards bought in and fucked shorts in the ass.
Trick is, they need to be heavily shorted companies that actually have some positive catalysts... Basically companies that have had bad press and short reports, but fundamentally are actually solid companies. It's hard to find the next Tesla, AMC, or GME, but they are out there... we're just conditioned to dismiss them because the mass media (including social media) tells us we are fools for being bullish on them.. see Deepfuckingvalue's early posts...
Tesla
Tesla did the one thing required to justify their share price.They have a loyal shareholder base that keeps holding and buying.Sentiment trumps fundamentals in most cases
lost me at the next tesla lol
Tesla is so well branded, very much like Apple, and most Tesla owners are dedicated to the product and the brand.  Just ask them and they'll tell you more than you want to hear, because they're excited.  There aren't many brands with that kind of power.  This enthusiasm accounts for at least part of the share price, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  Tesla is also the leader in a sector that is still emerging, so there's no reason to think its stock price will take a prolonged downturn.  It may correct, but it shouldn't bottom out.
It would need to have an autonomous taxi service on Earth and Mars and every car in both planets to be replaced with a Tesla for the current valuation.
Purely on an EV stance yea TSLA is probably overvalue, but Tesla isn‚Äôt just a car company.
Got on wsb around a year ago to date.  Right before that I converted all my amazon shares and other misc stuff into Tesla/calls.My stock account is \~1000% from June 2020.Mostly due to me purchasing calls on GME at $12 a share and selling at 220(I only put 5% of my money in at the time and it ballooned to being 60% of my portfolio)
I did +1300% last year thanks to Tesla, SPACs, and of course GME.It was a great year...Now, I have mostly been selling covered calls and using the premium for more risky options plays. NEGG was a winner on Fri :)Also, this survey will be skewed by reporter bias. Either people will want to brag about gainz or tout their retardness...so you'll get mostly extremes
Goddamn ive seen so many Tesla model 3s out today...its like every other car is a Tesla. There was one parked next to me at the fuckin gas station!? Like wtf...why does a Tesla need to go to a gas station? People have too much money.
ü§£ü§£Other posts from you within the past 24 hours:&gt $SEEL&gt $SEEL calls it‚Äôs at bottom&gt $SEEL oversold below $3 and got an $8 price target now.&gt #SEEL oversold to under $3 and got a price target of $8 this week. Saw it in the Tesla/amc chats on Webull. Someone confirm?&gt $SEEL oversold down to under $3 has a price target if $8 this week looking for someone to confirm since this was in the AMC Tesla chats on webull&gt Buying $AMC / $SEEL today! Both bout to rip!All of which were on other people's posts that were unrelated to SEEL.This is like the crack dealer complaining about a massive drug epidemic.
And who bets so heavily against tesla, with a brand new manufacturer that makes 400 vehicles a year? Jeezy Pete's, this guy was doomed from the beginning. At least diversify some into the meme Healthcare or meme clean energy. That shit has true potential.
I saw Elon Musk asking for gas money at an Austin, TX Walmart parking lot.Then he rolled away on a Model S.Times must be hard at Tesla HQ.
Elon - "Well statistically speaking, all cars burst into flames every now and then.  The question is whether Tesla cars turn into fireballs more often than other brands.  According to our stats, We would need 5 more Teslas to turn into fireballs for us to exceed the national average on auto explosions."
I believe it. There has been a core group of us who have been quietly buying this stuff up way before anyone on WSB put it on here.To be completely honest, I have no clue why it trended on WSB.This is not a short squeeze play. LOL. I would get whatever you can. Or just buy shares.My calls are exclusively so I can execute shares. I plan on holding this like it‚Äôs Tesla 5 years ago.Social Finance and 23&ampMe are my 2 highest conviction 6month-3year plays.
Tesla Superchargers can do a full charge in 25 mins.
Bought weekly Tesla options. Got ruined
Pretty much this. It‚Äôs probably going to be slow charging stations and the whole thing is probably tied back to Ford and Chevy. So Tesla spends billions building into their entire charging infrastructure and traditional auto just lobbies Biden admin to build it for them? Why not put this mo way towards our actual grid?
If EV charging can get down to the 10 mins at most it takes to fill the 50gal tank in my truck then yea we won't need 60 million chargers to cope with demand.I think the better solution is to roll out some big tax credits to employers to put in charging stations in parking lots and garages.The hospital by my house has 10 charging spots, all had Tesla S in them already when I got there at 6am...
CLNE may be a decent long term play. WKHS on the other hand doesn‚Äôt have much going on (despite what pump and dumpers will tell you). They lost the contract for USPS, they barely produce 400 vehicles a year and the chances of them pulling a Tesla are very slim (although not impossible) but you have to wait for a few years to see
Thank you Tesla I will never touch you again piece of üí©
Who else got tricked the fuck out by Tesla today ?
Elon has talked about the importance of continued rapid pace of innovation.Part of the reason for that is that rapid innovation protects you against would be copy cats. So if Tesla continues to innovate and optimize at a quick pace, then copy cats have no chance of ever really competing with Tesla.
 I probably have around $45k Tesla. waiting for $900 levels.  should I buy more?
Gotta love the media.. tesla estimates all week were 195‚Ä¶ this morning they change to 203k and tesla hits a little over 201k and now all you will see is how they missed estiamtes

That one sec spike in Tesla ah gave me blue balls
God why does my imaginary wife bitch so god damn much. Sure we are eating hot pockets for dinner tonight bc i bought Tesla fds but wtf. We still have one day untill they expire so stfu already
I agree, in hindsight.  But if picking Tesla or Amazon or Apple is easy, can you tell me what the next one will be?
I concluded that, for me, passive indexing was the soundest strategy, but I was saving enough that I allocated a small percentage of my portfolio to picking individual stocks hoping for a moonshot.Turned out, I bought a bunch of Tesla with that percentage, and that stock now has an outsized presence in my portfolio due to going 5x since I bought it.I think if you are saving enough, there is no harm in taking a small amount to satisfy that urge to try to pick a big winner.
I think people are making way too big of a deal with this. I believe she also sold some Tesla quite recently. Doesn't mean she thinks it is going to the shitter, just means that she had to adjust her portfolio to minimize risk
Yeah it's crazy. No way we could do it without the discount.Daycare, or a new Tesla every year...

Biggest bear case is the number of makers entering the market.  Tesla Market cap reflects a Monopoly that is going to erode.
I think NIO wins this. In China only. TESLA wins the world though IMO
yeah, but over time as the swarm grows and the bandwidth gets cheaper and cheaper and musk starts buying ground relays and augmenting the network‚Äôs service with landlines and cell towers and shit and fucking solar powered cell tower drones because I just made that up and it‚Äôll be a regular ol‚Äô data provider with a cool name.

Trudeau and his cabinet of activists are virtue-signalling asshats.This fact aside, the bulk of the costs of the 'transition' will be borne by middle class tax payers. Government has no money.  They collect money.  Anytime you hear 'incentive', 'rebate', 'credit' or some shit like that, the cost is borne by us with life getting evermore expensive.GM, Ford, all the big automakers will fill the gap, with more boutique firms like Tesla and commercial-centric's like Workhorse rounding things out.Heavy metals, lithium, graphite, copper, etc in massive quantities will be required.
Tesla going uppies big time tomorrow
Only to uneducated retail investors.  To anyone with a basic understanding of finance, she should never have been either.  A few months of red when she has a 5-year time horizon does not mean she‚Äôs a ‚Äúzero‚Äù‚Äîespecially since growth stocks in general took a hit for a few months because of external factors.  And she‚Äôs not necessarily a hero for making a good bet on Tesla and a couple of other winning stocks in a bull market.
Short term? Sure. Long term? Hell no.Ark isn't her first rodeo and won't be her last, her track record is open for anyone to see and has been posted here many times. Needless to say she doubles down on things that once was successful (tesla) regardless of future potential. I'd her funds go down she doubles down on more violation and higher risk, often leading to massive losses.Her ETFs generally peak within 3 years and crash within 5. She always bails out after a big dip all while telling people "it'll get better". None of her former ETFs ever recovered...
I work in this industry so my $0.02‚Ä¶.also on mobile so sorry.  I suspect that the stock price and P/E are taking into account the risk associated with intel.  They have struggled to deploy their newest technologies and are &gttwo years behind - executing and management of technical risk have been tough.  They have had to consider outsourcing operations to their competitors.I also think there are major potential headwinds with the direction chip companies are taking.  Take for example apple (M1), Tesla and google.  All are moving major applications from generalist chips where intel made their name to specialized chips designed to work with their(that companies) software.  Intel has to become a foundry to compete for this business (and has announced to invest to do just that) - but there will be more competition here for that.  Even servers which is where intel has been strong and showing some movement to custom chips.I think if they can sort out their technology scaling challenges they have great assets.  The new strategy from the exec team there seems decent And semi is expected to be strong for the next few years.  And their are some macro issues in their favor (concerns about too much tech concentration in Taiwan, lack of domestic (US) chip mfg.  But they have to get a good edge back and execute well or I think they have real risk of continuing to lose market share.To those saying US government needs will fill.  until recently used IBMs old fab in fishkill ny for a lot of defense needs.  But missles don‚Äôt need the most advanced chips like you find in computers (fishkill was 90/65nm vs TSMC which is announcing 2nm).  However I think we need to see how much desire there is to preserve domestic leading edge semiconductor mfg.
She has managed and failed multiple funds before ark and the only reason ark succeeded was one overwhelmingly lucky bet on Tesla. Without Teslas returns, ark funds would've never become mainstream as they were the best way to get Tesla exposure while also diversifying.
The argument for those holdings is around satellites proliferating making bandwidth cheaper and GPS more available/accurate. Therefore netflix will experience better margins and millions more people will reach the "has good enough internet for netflix" threshold, and John Deere can sell gps guided automated farming equipment around the world. The idea is to give broad exposure to the macro trend of space technology, not just focus on the companies actually putting the satellites in space. Similarly for the Bitcoin ETF, my guess is that since Tesla hold a large portion of the liquid bitcoin in the world, the company has a lot of exposure to bitcoin therefore include them in the etf.
It was great to ride with Tesla into the S&ampP 500 but I'm not too bullish on them, and I'm bearish on Cathie Wood.Should be a fun few days for BTC fans.
BB, AMC, Tesla and and AMC on sale this morning
should've bought NIO instead of Tesla 2 months ago god fucking dammit
Tesla 710+ by end of day. Let's go bulls!
Tesla opening at $710 today
How many times do we have to teach you old man?!    Tesla stonk only goes up.   Except somedays when it goes down.  But other times it goes up ü¶ç
If you crash in a Tesla, it cremates your body right at the scene, saving your family money.Very bullish
NIO the next tesla according to Cramer.He's making me rethink my long![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)But I will ride my calls till it hits $100 in AUGhttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/nio-to-surpass-tesla-in-china-electric-vehicles-navellier-says
Still think it‚Äôs a decent long term investment, cyber security is not going away, and their QNX software is in practically every electric vehicle except Tesla (over 195 million vehicles), but yeah‚Ä¶bought in at 20, also bought in on a few dips‚Ä¶bots got me. But still, fuck off.
Tesla PLTR guy here ‚Ä¶. Just want to leave the BB guys know I sold 10 PLTR 16c calls and bought BB shares to support the movement ..:.y‚Äôall better remember this when it‚Äôs Tesla time, the OG meme stock ‚Ä¶.
Tesla free money right now honestly
Oh I'm positive.  PM was my biggest position (60%) which kept paying a nice div and now went up finally.Tesla was 10% of it. Pipelines was 15%.  Other stuff like rail went up nice too.  Under performed index in my 'I can do better than the index' account.  So now I'm just back to sticking with the index.
Once PLTR and tesla partnership confirmed we üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Tesla gonna break 700 this week? Downvote for Yes, upvote for no
It might pop a little they are supposed to be doing something with Tesla
Tesla PLTR gang gang
"Blackberry is in a partnership with Telus" is this like a knock-off Tesla? Cause that would sound right
Tesla PLTR SPCE gang gang
Probably not, the ‚Äòrecall‚Äô was actually just a software update. Chinese Tesla owners don‚Äôt have to bring their car in for it either. It‚Äôs equivalent to an update to your phone‚Äôs OS
The real bullish news for Tesla is that there‚Äôs a new season of Rick and Morty.
Tesla is the king of America, NIO will be the king of China
NIO is taking many pages out of Tesla's book! Which is a great thing. I support them and hope they destroy legacy auto too! Tesla is and will always be king though.
I read a DD a while back stating that if GME were to mimic the Tesla squeeze it would reach 13.5k. Of course we all know that GME si is way higher and ape diamond hands are way stronger, so who the hell knows how high this thing's going
I throw out my jewel boxes of CDs because music is on my iPod now. My GF starts using Netflix as a verb. Friend rents a Tesla at 5x the price of a normal rental. Amazon packages accumulate in the lobby of the building. Any pattern like that? Buy the stonk before you buy the product.
if tesla hits 1000 this year, ill personally jerk off everyone in this sub
lmfao if they want to turn this into a tesla long squeeze on steroids, be my guest fuckers
He‚Äôs a paid shill, and a famewhore who prefers everyone listen to his FUD and likes to believe he has ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù of the market in that way. Cathie is the antithesis to that and has gained broad appeal and popularity. Naturally, Jim is probably being paid to shut her and Tesla down. Bc old money is oil money, and they aren‚Äôt happy.
Tesla $690C duh
I actually did just pick up the Tesla. Got it tinted yesterday. Tesla Model Y Performance [pic of car](https://imgur.com/gallery/O52aYC1)
man these tesla fds are so fucking stressful.. i feel like im losing years off my life from it bouncing up and down... lmao...
And yet Tesla is on the way back up.
Now when you look at it, Tesla gave you a free Tesla just for investing in Tesla. üòÇ
He would only get a free ride violation if he bought the Tesla with unsettled funds then sold it before settlement. If he bought the Tesla with settled cash and then sold the next day or same day that is okay.
Tesla $700 by noon
Congratulations WSB! Yesterday was a momentous day for the upper echelons of the mod hierarchy! Yesterday WSB hit the front page again on Reddit! A Mormon placed a bet that he‚Äôd drink coffee if Tesla hit a price by EOW! Going from piss martinis, yachts, cocaine and prostitutes, shitposts and low effort memes to coffee and an endless supply of DD!So wholesome!Let‚Äôs fucking go VIAC!
I mean Tesla is only going to keep going up for the next few weeks.
TESLA TO MARS and ur_mom giving bloweys the entire ride!
Tesla to $700 today?
How many new cars have you owned before? I would love to test drive it, but a Tesla dealership only came recently to my country and I am not looking for a new car.
Honestly, my positive opinion on Tesla comes solely from the fact that they forced every other auto manufacturer to get their shit together and actually develop their electric vehicles. (Don't own one, but do want their drivetrain underneath a 2006 Tacoma, c'mon coach building)And the GM EV1 doesn't count as that was pandering, miss marketed on purpose, and was killed off before any good could come from it.
&gtLike, I honestly don‚Äôt understand why people find this so hard. Many people don't like conflict. Or having a car purchase devolve into a hours long squabble over multiple days, when it could be over in five minutes instead.That is partially a reason why Tesla got so much praise for their order process (zero bullshit, transparent price, no haggling) and so much flak from dealers who felt exposed.
1. Inflation fears were overblown and everyone is rotating back to growth stocks like Tesla. This is the most important factor.2. There was an agreement on a new infrastructure bill in Washington that includes electric vehicle funding.3. Tesla just came out with the best car ever made by all traditional measures (e.g., speed, safety).4. There is a long term secular growth trend towards technology and green energy.
Investing in a low market cap young company is a high risk high reward move, that Panasonic pulled off well.Investing in Tesla now is a medium risk low reward move as they're already the highest valuation in the car industry and insane growth is already priced in. For high rewards, the rest of the car industry would need to collapse pretty much.
Even as recent as a couple of years ago there were significant doubts about whether Tesla would go bankrupt. Tesla has only been profitable for a few years and there were periods before that where it literally only had enough money for a few weeks of operations.Tesla has paid off for those who held through that, but anybody who pretends like it wasn‚Äôt a risky bet to hold all these years is lying to themselves.
This, especially since every new EV car news or vlog that comes out it gets compared to a Tesla, not a Taycan or Etron or a Kona
~3x more profit than Tesla has made in its entire 18 year existence.https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/net-income
Lol, you just compared Tesla to a few companies that make shit ton of money, like really lots. Off the top of my head: Facebook - $10B, Google - $20B, Apple - $25B, Microsoft - $15B. That‚Äôs off the top of my head and only for the last quarter. Tesla? Well, they sold some carbon credits and made $0.5B, while still loosing money on their primary products (unless that product is selling carbon credits).
I don't know why you're being downvoted - if the Ford F150 EV is actually good, it's a really bad sign for Tesla.  I am sure they can continue to be a niche player, but if other carmakers catch up, they're not going to be the future of transportation the way their stock is priced.
Does no one click articles these days? Did you u/MrJACCthree?Title :&gtPanasonic sells Tesla stake for **$3.6 bln**, may use cash for strategic investmentsWould've been the hint you misunderstood the sentence.. It is a rather bad one to be fair, especially if quoted in a void, but they compare the stake at end of March 2020 to today's "if they hadn't sold" for whatever reason. 1.4M @ $21.15 is not split-adjusted, they bought around the IPO.
People always shit on Tesla's but they never look at the bright side of things. For example:1) Tesla's have terrible interiors, you don't need luxury since you're humble, you're paying 80k on a car with a Camry interior because you're so humble.2) Huge panel gaps, surely you don't need small panel gaps? Who cares about quality, it's all about owning a Tesla.3) Rattling materials, you said it yourself, the soothing rattling can be music to your ears.
Tesla is the iPhone of EVs. They are the icon and gold standard of electric vehicles. Whether or not it's hype or speculation, doesn't really matter. They are the lead and first mover on EVs and more than likely FSD. They deserve the hype and speculation.
People screamed 10 years ago that Tesla was going to go bankrupt
Tesla has the highest brand loyalty in the industry. I know there are people who really love their Fords or Toyotas, but objectively speaking the proportion isn't as high.Also Toyota seems determined to ride the (non-plugin) hybrid bandwagon into irrelevance. Their EV strategy is extremely weak.
&gtBuying Tesla 10 years ago was an entirely different story.You're right, it was really risky back then. Props to Panasonic.
The Tesla battery factory is actually a joint venture with Panasonic, which provided all the battery expertise.
Buying Tesla 10 years ago was an entirely different story. They're very right to sell now.
Rule 1, don't short SPY.Rule 2, don't short Tesla.
My shares of Tesla are happy to see that you got screwed
You either get shot for defending or attacking Tesla based on whatever the headline of the thread is.  For example, this is a headline that provides ammunition to Tesla bears, so you will be upvoted if you attack Tesla in this thread.  Because the people who are reading it are more likely to be Tesla bears.
Tesla has been using 18650 cells manufactured by Panasonic in Asia in the Models S and X cars since 2013. Pretty interesting that each Tesla battery is made up of hundreds of small 18650's.
&gtTesla has risen a lot based on speculation and hype. You get shot for these kinds of statements on reddit.
&gtPanasonic bought 1.4 million Tesla shares at $21.15 each in 2010 for about $30 million. That stake was worth $730 million at the end of March 2020. Shares have gained almost seven fold since then and closed up 3.5% at $679.82 apiece on Thursday.
It seems like a good move imo. Tesla has risen a lot based on speculation and hype. I feel like a lot of other companies are going to come up and try to take some part in the same market.
Tesla $1k?Y or N
I don't know about that, but I do know that when 30% of a stonk's float is shorted, it's incredibly volatile and anything can set it off, starting a chain reaction . People mocked BBBY when it fell to $27 just last week. (The calls I bought back then are showing a nice profit already haha) People are calling it a pump&ampdump now that it's back to the level it hit 10 days ago.Tough crowd. :P BBBY is a fundamentally solid company - it's not the next Tesla or Amazon, but it's more fundamentally strong than some of the tickers getting pumped on WSB. Nobody is trying to distract people from AMC, BB, GME, etc. (Hell, I have a position in GME, a big stake in WKHS, and I swing-trade BB on top of my BBBY.) All of this is just to provide an option, an alternative, if anyone is so inclined. BBBY will go up at some point, and I think that point is approaching.
Should I risk it all on Tesla call options
Tesla 0DTE calls tomorrow? Why not
Can apes just all buy 1 share of Tesla so we can watch Mormon dude drink coffee?
If I think Tesla is going to 1000, nio to 70 and Apple to 200 by year end should I buy January 2022 options or just buy shares
Meant to buy 10 Tesla calls and ended up buying 80 by accident at close. I‚Äôm financially ruined
Of course the person in a religious cult is also invested in Tesla.
Tesla $685 pre-market and $720 eod
I think decent chance we see a run back up to $900 in the coming weeks.The increase in price is likely mainly due to shareholder rotation. Shareholders who needed to diversify or thought the price was high have been selling and are likely for the most part done with their selling now. You might have catalysts like the positivity associated with the S Plaid (especially that new motor was a surprise that no one was expecting) but shareholder rotation is likely the main explanation.As long as Tesla can continue to perform and they put out nice numbers for Q2 reaffirming the story, I think we can get back up there in short order.As to people thinking it is overvalued, there are plenty who think this stock is perhaps the best stock you can buy today to ensure future returns. No point trying to time this as, like you have seen this past week, completely unexpected the stock shot up. Probably Michael Burry is someplace screaming.
Tesla is teasing me! You naughty, naughty üëø
Tesla: drops $5- "fuck it's going back to 640"Tesla: pumps $5- "all aboard last chance $725 EOD"

[Mormon Church cashes in on GameStop and Tesla stock craze](https://www.kxan.com/news/business/mormon-church-cashes-in-on-gamestop-and-tesla-stock-craze/)
I have a strong suspicion Tesla will never be very public about the energy division. The return on investment is higher with the batteries in the cars, but surplus production can be used for energy arbitrage using autobidder. Tesla‚Äôs secret ‚Äúgambit‚Äù Company in Texas is definitely not the only one. Zero chance. Why so secret? the amount of pushback they will get will be absolutely enormous if they start really publicizing what they stated goal is. Right now you only really hear it from Youtubers‚Ä¶ But the ability to store energy gives you the ability to control the price of energy. Tesla can essentially, overtime, control the price of energy via storage capacity. they will arbitrage this while not being responsible for grid upkeep or generation. It‚Äôs a pretty sweet situation but it could backfire heavily when it becomes more publicly known to the extent to which this program is expanding, it will be fought. Imagine Tesla taking in energy at night very cheaply, then distributing it during the most profitable part of the day, early to late afternoon. This will bankrupt grid owners and create hundreds of billions of dollars of stranded generation assets.
Tesla dip. No way it doesn‚Äôt go 700 with all the 700c expiring tomorrow
TSLA pumpers, stop saying you're gonna buy a Lambo. Say you're gonna buy a Tesla with the profits. Then it will run past $700.
Can we break 700 already with Tesla

How about if Tesla reaches 750 you never knock on a persons door ever again.
&gtAlso here to prove you‚Äôre not a terrible person if you drink coffee, and you‚Äôre not kicked out if you do haha. My reasoning for never drinking it is actually because I just try to stay away from addictive substances, at the bare minimum at least I am saving money by not drinking it so I can invest in more Tesla and lose it there loli would argue that sugar is more addicting than caffeine. while there are coffee addicts, and some jokingly talk about it openly, it's way more mild than more well known substances (crack, tobacco, etc). I definitely think Sugar is one of the most evil things to ever hit the legal market in such high quantities.cheers and I hope to see your thoughts on coffee this week!
thats a nice new tesla
Tesla the original meme is BACK!!
it‚Äôs perceived as a ‚Äúgrowth stock‚Äù which are frowned upon at this moment. also there are large shorts on it keeping the price down and it is counter to oil so it‚Äôll face natural resistance much like tesla and EV tech does. but it is the future it‚Äôs is a growth stock so for long term investors i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad.

Well you have to look at it at the largest scale conceivable to change the entire world to alternative/green energy. It would be a new energy race.  You would have sprawling mines all over and change the existing infrastructure. Like a Tesla is better than buying a new Truck but the most environmentally friendly thing to do is actually buy a used Prius.

To all the WISH haters saying WISH sells cheap crap therefore is a crap comany:  Walmart sells junk, has been for decades, Target's crap isn't much better.  McDonald's literally sells edible poison that causes heart disease and diabetes. Tesla sold cars that actually exploded. What about Microsoft? Remember the Windows phone? There are tons of companies that manufacture and sell crap, yet are extremely popular and profitable.  WISH is not the products they sell, they are an e-commerce marketplace, that is their business, that is where their value is. WISH is gaining marketshare by the minute in the developing world.  Is McDonald's a successful company because they sell the best food? No.  Is KIA a successful company because they make the best cars? No. Get your heads out of your pretentious asses. /end rant
I think its a legitimate concern, and a contributing factor as to why the price is so attractive. But look at Tesla, they had a very rocky start as well. Making vehicles is hard. I think ultimately they will prevail.

It's like watching Tesla climb and climb even after their stock split, but I've got a better feeling in my heart for GME.
That‚Äôs great news. We need all the batteries we can build. 200k per year starting mid 2023, I imagine these are already spoken for to fulfill F150 orders and expand Mach E. So possibly by calendar year 2024 Ford will be 1/40th electric at 250k EV units per year. Which is great. But Tesla is planning to build about 2.5m EVs in 2024, which yields auto revenue around $135b annually, excluding energy (which is intended to outpace auto revenue).I am very comfortable owning Tesla stock :)
Took delivery on my Model Y Performance this week, all I have to say is anyone who doesn‚Äôt understand TSLA‚Äôs valuation has never driven a Tesla.  Fook man, this thing are fast.
Why do people pay premium for iPhones? Same reason they‚Äôll pay for Tesla. If you don‚Äôt get it, then you don‚Äôt get it. Move on.
Counterpoints - Ford can only build 50k Mach e per year because they didn‚Äôt secure a battery supply. F150 will be the same story. Lots of demand, no batteries to build them. Ford just broke ground on their first battery factory, slated to open in 2026, will be able to supply 1/15th of their fleet. Hopelessly behind on battery production, to the tune of decades. Tesla has 5 battery production factories under construction, several of them already producing. Tesla has essentially zero debt (all convertible) and $20b COH. Iron fortress balance sheet. Ford has net debt of nearly $100b (?).Ford needs to take $200b in write downs from zombie assets.Ford needs to thread a very thin needle to survive the next decade.
Ford isn‚Äôt a vehicle manufacturer, they are a vehicle assembler.  Third parties manufacture the parts that go into their vehicles.  Tesla, yes may be overvalued, but are 5 years ahead of Ford in the EV world.  Don‚Äôt expect the Ford EV truck to come in anywhere near 40K. They use that price to gain pre-sales, but it will be much much higher Fords value comes 5 years down the road.  At that time Tesla is already dominant
Tesla isn‚Äôt a car company, it‚Äôs an energy company, you can‚Äôt compare apples to oranges.
Yep, it's funny when people make these comparisons. It's like, "hey guys, nikola is involved in green vehicle production and its only worth a few billion. Tesla is worth hundreds of billions. Nikola is undervalued!"Hurts physically
Tesla is overvalued as fuck but I wouldn‚Äôt short it. Learn from other shorts, you only get destroyed

Well, if you want to retire early, you‚Äôll need to save aggressively and spend frugally. Talking about buying a car is going in the opposite direction. Granted, a car might be a necessity, but that is completely opposite of your goal. Putting a nice down payment on a car just means you now have less money saved to retire.Step 1, you should be maxing out your Roth IRA and 401k. 14% to your 401k likely isn‚Äôt going to cut it unless you‚Äôre making over 150k. I would also look for side hustles and semi-passive money earning opportunities. Around 28, I also had a small chunk of money saved up. Instead of buying a new Tesla I was eyeing, I ended up buying a condo that I rent out on Airbnb. It‚Äôs value increased pretty substantially (luck), but the rental income has been amazing. I could probably quit my jobs and live purely off rental income right now. Anyway, save even more, if you‚Äôre going to buy a car, buy a cheap reliable one, and when spending money, I would ask myself if the purchase is a necessity or if it will help you earn more money in the long run.
I‚Äôm gonna buy a Tesla, with or without wish but I‚Äôd get the self driving package if it does lol
Ape logic: I just calculated the final price for BB. Hear me out: BB IVY will be like Android, while Tesla‚Äôs version will be like IOS. Since Tesla is trading at roughly $600, I calculated the value of BB share at $11500. So that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm selling. Don‚Äôt settle for anything less!
Honestly I find Palentir company and CEO as one of the most fascinating new companies. It‚Äôs legit Tesla status changing the world through AI. THINK FACEBOOK IN 2010
they just need one profitable quarter in the next two to qualify! I expect that similar to tesla, due to the high volatility of the stock, they will not be added before the second consecutive profitable four quarter spell, but after that, i don't see how the committee can justify leaving them out.
I miss my money fuck you Tesla
I‚Äôll hire out the things that I‚Äôm bad at or I know will take me 5x longer than a professional. Example: I fixed a major appliance last weekend because I knew exactly what needed to be done and it took me 30 minutes to do, saving me a few hundred dollars. I did it during a time that I wouldn‚Äôt have gained any valuable time with my kids or wife.I hired out an electrician to add a new circuit and install a Tesla wall charger in my garage. I think I could have figured it out but it would have taken me all day and by the time I was done, the risk of getting it wrong was significant.I used to do all my own auto repair and all my own housework but anymore it‚Äôs about 50/50 when it comes to major work.I always mow my lawn or have my son do it but I like mowing the lawn. I have a friend who hires that out and does other things himself that I wouldn‚Äôt want to do like flooring.
Unpopular opinions: Fords new line of cars are 9999x better than Tesla
Probably a bad analogy tbh. This is what I was trying to get at:Tesla's software, that maps the environment for their autonomous vehicles to operate in, is exclusive to Tesla and only Tesla.BB's software that is similar in mapping the environment, is not exclusive to one car manufacturer.
So your saying it‚Äôs basically Tesla and the price should reflect by losing 3% today?
Tesla is to Apple as BB is to Android. This is just getting started.
I don't know better than Burry. What I do know is you don't bet against Elon.You're talking about a guy who YOLO'D his money into an EV company (non traditional) vs a guy who base his analysis on traditional fundamentals.Elon has conviction, I'll put my money with a guy who also leads SpaceX. Tesla practically has access to engineers and patents from SpaceX. Just look at the recent [Giga Press](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giga_Press) and the alloy used developed from SpaceX.
Idk about that one chief. You are harping too much on P/E. FAANG stocks when they were all up and coming, being a growth stock all had insane P/E. I believe Tesla in the long run will be a quality blue chip stock. I'm invested for 10 years minimum. Who cares about the short term. This is just the beginning of the EV boom.
Diversify diversify diversify the old farts tell you. Diversify deeeezzzz nutz. A simple portfolio of apple, google, microsoft, disney and amazon outperforms any fuckin index fund you can come up with the next 10 years imo. Shit, throw in 10 percent tesla and 10 percent palantir too if you want some fun factor. Fuck owning the rest of the sp500 with old dogs like att that need to be brought behind the barn and shot out of their misery.
so many retards here still gambing on tesla like it's 2020
most likely.I like how people think they are going to outsmart burry, when the guy made more money with tesla puts in 3 month that this whole sub will make in 5 yrs.
Good gains, but when was this taken? Tesla hasn't been 700+ a share for at least a month or 2
For all we know burrytard is already out of Tesla puts lol
Why do I feel sad when I lost $500 betting on baseball games but don‚Äôt feel a shit when I lost $10,000 gambling on Tesla calls???
What this shows is that the gains in the stock market are being driven by more money being put in stocks than in other things.  Tesla is hovering around new equilibrium price levels with each subsequent pump of new money into the financial system.It's a direct consequence of QE during the pandemic.  Which is basically over now, so it will not happen again.It'll probably drop another 30-50% as the emergency measures are withdrawn because everyone will flee for the exits to take profits.
1.  Tesla does.2.  Few cars have forward facing cameras.  All have rear cameras.  It cost money and inventory to to stock cars with varying options, which is why cars come in option packages.3.  Privacy laws vary in other countries, in the US it's fine if you're in a public place.4.  Cars take a few years to develop so by the time it's on sale, stuff like infotainment is already dated.  Towards the end of the average 5-7 year model lifecycle, stuff like the navigation gets woefully outdated.  That's why I don't want what the carmaker offers.  Aftermarket stuff can be swapped in and out, and can be on much faster update cycles.5.  The solution is to license an aftermarket company to make a cam that cleanly and easily mounts into a plug-play slot on the overhead console or rear view mirror mount.  But the crowd that would buy this stuff tends to be the same crowd that buys the aftermarket stuff for a fraction of the price.  So you're back to why carmakers don't do this.  I've seen some of the licensed mounts in car parts catalogs and they don't mount cleanly/easily and cost 3-4x as much, which is why I've never seen one in person - very few people want to pay 3-4x for the same part with just an Audi or BMW badge on it.
Everyone moving back to Tesla.. WSB is healing
No shit, eh. The crash won't last long since everyone and their grandmother will be putting their life savings into TESLA if it drops like 50+ percent.
you're not buying the calls. say you hold 100 shares of Tesla then you can sell 1 call that is considered covered because you can pay the shares out without needing to go into the market. The point of selling high OTM calls like say 800+ $ calls is that for someone to exercise it then they pay you 800$ a share + the premium already paid to buy those shares from you. If the share price is lower than 800 then the call expires useless since it's cheaper to buy in the market and it won't be exercised (if they do they're an idiot and just go buy back the shares cheaper than you sold em at.) Now when it expires you keep your premium + the shares. Generally pretty safe play if you know how high a stock can go and you give yourself an extra margin of safety though you can certainly get higher premiums playing more risky and closer to being ITM
It‚Äôs overvalued bc of the infinity gamma squeeze it went under and all the Tesla shorts getting clapped hard. I mean loyal auto legacy people will most likely buy Ford, etc in the beginning but once they see the supercharger network, UI of Tesla, and many other things they‚Äôll be doing‚Ä¶auto legacy companies won‚Äôt stand a chance. Tesla also has the 4680 batteries they haven‚Äôt even implemented in their cars and that alone will make the model 3 and y be in the mid 400 mile range easily

Nope, Tesla rallied before the split, went down later and rallied again on the index inclusion news.
Tendies in a Tesla
Apple and Tesla both sunk right after their splits. The time to buy is after.
This is good stuff, but no one should misconstrue it to mean and that you should buy Tesla at $900. Valuations in the stock market are completely insane. Let me repeat that: completely insane.If you buy AMC at $60, you should not feel calm when it crashes back down to 20 or 10 or 5 or 2. You should realize that you bought something at the height of insanity and you are now paying the price.
I‚Äôve lost here $16k of hard-earned money here since the OG Tesla run. How do I get flair
I need Elon to announce on his personal Twitter that Tesla is partnering withh BB üöÄ
Just remembering when this subreddit railed on Tesla for four years straight before it went to 400 and higher and never went back down.
The push for $13 with CLNE is to create a domino effect and print this motherfucker sooner than later. Nonetheless, CLNE is as good of a hold as Tesla was 5 years ago. It will consistently make you bananas the longer you hold and you will finally make your wife‚Äôs BF so happy he might fuck you too. This is not financial advice but it is money suggestions. And fuck the Cucklord bears that could make more money on buying and holding a fundamentally sound company than spending their boyfriends üåàüêªmoney on puts.
The new hvac units are extremely efficient. Heating is now 50% more efficient and the range will not be near as affected by AC as it would heat. If you're cruising around like a normal person, AC won't fuck up your day or range. If you want to cherry-pick a "day long-road-trip circuit through Death Valley with the cabin set at 64 degrees" you might succeed at skewing the results to the intended effect. But then again, I drive about 150km per day and charge my car at home while I sleep, like I do my cellphone. Four years of Tesla ownership (older models with far less range than the plaid) and range has never been a concern.  If it was, I might consider the very convenient lifestyle of an ICE: visit a secondary location once a week to have the privilege of paying 10x more to fuel my car.
TESLA AUTO PILOT IS STATICALLY SAFER ON FREEWAY THAN HUMAN DRIVERS DADDY ELON IS SAVING LIVES AND HANDING OUT FREE TENDIES
$BB 24/25 EV producers use Blackberry in their new vehicles. All except Tesla who will have to use BB because it has become regulatory with the ISO.
Were you working in 2000?  If you were, you know that it is very much like today.  We had etoys, which sold toys on line to have them delivered via UPS to your house.  We had Intel, Intel, Dell, and Microsoft providing computers.  We had AOL providing network access and internet content for $25 a month.  One thing we didn't have was a large stock quite as overpriced as Tesla.  Tesla is a $50-$100 company trading at $600.  Cisco only had a PE of 110, not 600 like Tesla.  Companies were laying fiber in the ground like there was no tomorrow (which was sort of true). We had [pets.com](https://pets.com) instead of Chewy.  We had webvan instead of Instacart.   Ariba did b2b.    The only thing that was different is rates haven't started going up yet.  If that inflation gets bad or sticks around a while forcing the Fed to raise rates, tech stocks will absolutely tank.  Nvidia doesn't get to keep an 80 PE when rates and inflation are at 4%.  It drops by 75%.  Intel was an amazing company in 2000 and it still makes loads of money, yet it still hasn't hit its 2000 high.  Back to Tesla -- I believe it will never see the $900 stock price again.  Ever.
right after you sell Tesla will go to $1,000
Tesla 700 tomorrow
What the fuck? This firm appears to sue just about everyone in a class action. I looked at their website. They don‚Äôt seem like ambulance chaser level, but definitely not too far off!Tesla, Samsung, Amazon, Exxon, Facebook,‚Ä¶fucking Amtrak. yo this firm sues everybody.
Indeed. AMD rocks in digital entertainment.The PS5, the Xbox X/S, the GPU market (6000 series GPUs), the APU market (5700G/5600G), the consumer CPU market, the handheld market (e.g. Aya Neo or even the new Valve console launching with AMD), the laptop market (Razer launched their new AMD 5900HX laptops), or the ASUS G15 advantage (with AMD CPU/GPU &amp Smartshift+SAM).... even the DATACENTER market.Even Elon wants AMD APUs and GPUs in Teslas to game while on autonomous driving.And Samsung is bringing it to the S22.... with Ray-tracing.I mean, it is a no-brainer.Google, Microsoft, Sony, Samsung, Tesla, Razer, Lenovo, HP, Dell, ACER, ASUS, Valve, etc.**Everyone that wants gaming entertainment is on AMD.**
Used to be a cellphone company, emphasis on cyber security. Sold their cellphone patents. QNX is the OS that many cars use for their interface Honda, BMW, Toyota to name a few. Tesla uses a linux-based OS-meaning very little security. As cyber security becomes more of a challenge, BB has strong footings in the game with a ton of patents revolving around security. Thats what made me go in on bb. Bought in early dec, holding 90 shares as a broke recent college grad lmao
I‚Äôm bullish af on Ford. Company piviot so well. Their Mach E competes with Tesla and it was built in 2 years. Their EV trucks are gonna be huge.
I wish for loan students and new tesla! Big Amen!
First sign up for options then buy naked call options on tesla
There's some sound advice on this subreddit. Unfortunately, it tends to get drowned out by some awful advice made by people who gained $10 investing in Tesla last year.
BB going up before earnings and might not moon still. People need to remember it‚Äôs not a race and it‚Äôs got to organically come about. Look at even Tesla shit is coming back to reality
üòÇ why don‚Äôt you want people knowing you paid over $840 for your Tesla shares? Love when people hide CPS.
Tesla is kinda screwed. They couldn‚Äôt make profits in the 10 years they had a monopoly. Now there‚Äôs finally real competition and they won‚Äôt have customers to buy their carbon credits since other car companies will qualify on their own now
It‚Äôs funny that a subreddit named WallstreetBETS wants a company to have the following before they invest:1) 100,000 preside vehicles2) $75 billion cash reserve3) EV, but not too futuristic. Maybe JUST LIkE Tesla, but not.4) $5 stock price, but should be $500.This is a prerevenue play. The DD is there. The potential is their. #RIDEorDIE have rolled the dice and we believe all the pieces will fall in place. Yes, some are zealous, but that shouldn‚Äôt cloud the opportunity.
Increasing rates .25 basis points after 2 years of inflation would not put stocks anywhere near their current value today. Tesla would dip from $4000 to $3000
I‚Äôve lost $200k in a day once. Tesla FD yolo lol
When something starts with "The next Tesla?" you already know its a garbage post
Tesla DD. If Elon says something that sounds cool, price goes up.  If Elon says something stupid, price dips then goes back upIf Elon says something groundbreaking is coming out, it probably will take 3 times longer then he says, but price goes up.If Elon says something completely rational and measured.  People will panic, think the world is ending, and price will drop.
So I've been OTL on Tesla a bit, but a Model 2 is in the works? So the lineup went from S3XY to 2S3XY?Bullish. I'm in.
There is no NEXT Tesla, the Next Tesla is Tesla
Damn, my account is nuked. PTD, Margin Called,  can‚Äôt buy any more shit. And what‚Äôs wack is that I don‚Äôt even day trade. I did it on accident in April messing around with the app and got cursed. Unless my Tesla FDs have a miracle turnaround, I‚Äôm screwed.
I don't think he lost money on Tesla. He was saying this near the highs, and Tesla may sustain these prices, but there's no question it's one of the most overvalued companies there is.
Tesla split 5:1 and is at $600+.600x5= ??? ü§î
What‚Äôs really depressing about losing money on Tesla and being from California is EVERY OTHER FUCKING CAR I WILL SEE TODAY WILL BE A TESLA
look at his prepandemic 13f filings he was managing around 500m he is now managing some where between 1.5b and 2b before selling the Tesla shorts. He has made more since Covid then he did from the housing bubble.His gains are better than Kathy Woods and while ARKK is down 35% he is making money. If he has sold his Tesla puts he at least has 1b cash that we can‚Äôt see. If the market does see a 20% to 30% correction. He may have 5 to 6b to start purchasing stocks. It‚Äôs like watching some one with loaded dice on  craps table.
Oil Futures pumping? Time to buy a Tesla. Im not paying $10 a gallon again.
$1.7M on a 60k investment.I paid for college cashing out tesla at 27, msft 32, apple at 60, Amazon at 213.
Easy to be right, been saying the same thing he is for 18 months, have the losses to show for it.  The trick is timing though, I thought Tesla was a bubble when it was around $400 on the way up, all the way to over $900. I still think $400 is a bubble, what I think is irrelevant, it‚Äôs all about ‚ÄúWhen‚Äù
Lol PLTR is bizzaro Tesla
I‚Äôm holding BB for long term. Whether it goes off or not, it‚Äôs a legitimate company. People only associate their phones with the Blackberry name, it‚Äôs seriously undervalued. I don‚Äôt think it will be the next Amazon or Tesla. But it has potential to be bigger than what is it is now .
If bill gates can‚Äôt figure out how to stop the cows from farting then this stock is a rocket‚Ä¶.üåùShould be the next tesla stock at $10,000 a share.

The market's 5 year frwrd pe is somewhere around 18, I think 19?If the sp500 is to end the year down 5% from here...the forward pe would be 18. This is with the backdrop of 35% more liquidity in the economy from the fed...this is with the 10 yr probably ending the year at 2%...this is with the fed funds rate being 0. This is with growth for next year expected to be ~10%. This is with the economy coming OUT of a recession. Yes, there are pockets of dog shit with meme stocks. yes some stocks like tesla are speculative, but the market, big tech, etc. are trading at or lower than their 5 yr average and if we go down &gt10%..we'd be cheap. It's important to follow fundamentals and tune out noise, especially when it's people preaching their own portfolio.
Cramer called ARVL the "mini Tesla" when its spac merger was announced.
Looool Tesla man, get it together bro
They completely destroyed all of the lies from the last 2 months on this call. Added 200 shares. No bankruptcy. Finally Steve is gone. Former Tesla exec will be our new CEO. Production still on track and enough cash until May of 2022.
Tesla doesn‚Äôt build last mile delivery vehicles.. but you‚Äôre entitled.
I remember when Tesla was the fave meme stock now it‚Äôs basically a boomer stonk lol
I have more in Tesla, of course not more than AMC, but this is just a Yolo account. Helps me separate my feelings when I make risky plays
So let's talk about this:&amp#x200BYou say 2 years before hydrogen and electric take over.  I wish I could just link to a comment I made that shoots that to hell, but my intern already nuked it.  So I'll summarize:&amp#x200BThere's zero hydrogen infrastructure right now.  It's going to magically appear in 2 years?  Let's not even talk about the supply chain of getting the hydrogen to the refueling stations, or building the refueling stations.  Let's just talk about how it took 12 years to get most of the Keystone laid, and that's one pipe.  We're gonna lay hydrogen all over the country in 2?  It's taken $CLNE over a quarter century to build out their infrastructure.  And there's still the issue that there are a lot of problems with the tech, not the least of which (at least for commercial transport) is hauling capacity.&amp#x200BElectric:  Tesla recently had to cancel an entire model of car because they were forced to admit that their battery technology was reaching its limits, and that the planned Super Plaid was not going to be able to perform plus was going to have almost no range.  That's a clamshell sedan loaded to the tits with batteries under your feet.  If their batteries are running into problems with that, how do you think it's going to translate to commercial transport?   Gonna stuff a 53' trailer with 8' of batteries?  Space and load weight is money, transport isn't going to go with that.  Going to stop to recharge for 4 hours every 3 hours?  Time is money, transport isn't going to go with that.  And then there's the issue of the $250-300K for the vehicle vs. a $250 retrofit on an ICE.  Money is money, transport isn't going to go with that.  Comparing extraction NG facilities to biomethane doesn't show an understanding of why the biomethane aspect is an important capstone.  There's a big difference between nat gas for real estate vs. nat gas for transport.
100k in amc and 2k in teslaü§î the internet really has taken over.

The graph is for ETFs not companies. Why would you compare that to Tesla especially when OPs post is specifically about less risk (therefore less reward).  Your thought process here is confusing

Have fun betting against Tesla! Worked really well for everyone in the past.
Aside from the fact that making cars actually makes Tesla money...They're losing money because they are accelerating their growth at a rapid pace. When Berlin and Austin are done they'll make a lot more money and be spending less.Also, saying that Ford's truck is going to be amazing is pretty shortsighted. Sure, they have the Mach E out there that they've made, what, 50k of? Ford lacks the experience that Tesla has, and they also produce a small fraction of the EVs that Tesla makes.You go ahead and join Burry on the short side, and you may well make a lot of money. Long term, Tesla is the one to own, not Ford. Ford has proven they can make and sell a low volume EV. What they haven't proven is they can make something with real volume and sell it. And what is not yet known is what will happen to all of those Ford dealers when Ford goes full EV and those dealers say fuck you, we won't sell that shit for you because we make no money on it.
I really don‚Äôt know how people invest. Making a pickup trucks is an over saturated industry with some of the established bad boys already in it. Tesla is probably the only new EV company I‚Äôd invest. Ford and GM already have control over the pickup market and they moving in on hard on these EV pickups so I really don‚Äôt know what Lordstown was doing there. This is an easy put play with little to no DD. My price target is $5!
Why not both? I agree with you that tech will be fundamental in our lives in the future, that doesn't mean stock prices will reflect that. Stock markets are forward looking and have already incorporated a large part of that envisioned future and more in some cases (e.g. Tesla). Past performance does not equal future performance.
the specific details do nothing to challenge the notion that Tesla is trading at an unreasonably high valuation if your goal is substantial share price appreciation in the next few years.It's far from the only stock in that position.
Lol idk why you felt the need to say that but I pretty much know everyone here I‚Äôve been on WSB for years. I drop TA &amp stock picks sometimes.Last week I mentioned Amazon, Baba, AMD, CRSR, Apple, and a few others. This week I like Tesla. They‚Äôve been consolidating very well since the beginning of the year. Either way cheers, never saw the point in acting like a cunt to someone you don‚Äôt know.
Don‚Äôt sleep on Tesla stock. Big moves soon.
Do you have any idea why Tesla fell or are you just going to parrot off of a downswing and not actually understand why it happened?
Not the same thing but Tesla is valued insanely. Obviously a company valued at 2 Billions is not at the level of 600 Billions Tesla. But it might be a better investment.
If Tesla motors is worth 400 billion mkt cap then nokia mkt cap should be at least 100 billion.So we're looking at 20-25 bucks a share all things being equal.
To all CLNE folks here:The news has been ripe that the largest shareholder in CLNE had shed 1.2 million shares. Which they see as a negative. Somehow these people forget to state that the company which did this: Total Energies, still holds 26.7% of CLNE. If some people see this as something negative but not as profit taking by selling a small stake. There is no need to comment further on such people. Given recent partnerships CLNE has had with Amazon, Chevron etc I am confident. Also CLNE produces Carbon Negative fuel RNG  which electric is not. The sale which is done by both the largest shareholder and the company is to increase the capacity of Carbon Negative fuel stations and research. Some people point to this being costly and I say so was Tesla too costly for many to purchase. Once CLNE completes this we will have a great future. Plus the current Biden administration is pro renewable energy and given CLNE is carbon negative the prospects are great.
Haven‚Äôt seen any Tesla talk in awhile. Might fuck around and make some bad decisions.
I originally turned 11k into 36 with the help of FCEL, from there I traded Tesla a bit along with some other energy stocks now I‚Äôve decided to jump completely into IDEX
Tesla? That's old news!I just ordered a sweet [C1000 in fire-engine red](https://californiahvip.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY20-Workhorse-C-1000-ZE-200722.png)! My wife's boyfriend is going to be so jealous!!

ARKK is crap. All its returns are due to covid bets and Tesla which is now a garbage can.For 4 years ARKK returned nothing.
$WISH should become another cult stock like Tesla to WSB
Tip 1: Avoid ANY and ALL get rich blah blah blah anything. It's all bullshit looking for some way to exploit you directly or indirectly. Don't fall for this. You will lose.Tip 2: Avoid the hype until you know what you're doing.  It'll take years to really start getting a good grasp (whether trading or just, "is stock A too expensive and overextended?"). Generally, if everybody's already bullish on it, you're too late. Think Tesla. Tip 3: Whatever you do, be patient. It's going to take time. Devote time and energy to working income and not trading.  I've learned this one the hard way over the years. I'm only now getting good at trading but I'm still in the hole all-time.
Tesla is the OG meme srock
This is the best Tesla analysis I have ever seen!
TSLA is going to LAVA. What you have is called HYPE.*They just sold their 1 million th car couple weeks ago yet there are much valuable than the rest of the automakers combined .*Overpriced let alone.*Their ev market share is declining rapidly.*No wise investor would hold their money in a company where CEO is a scammer. Tesla invests 1.5 b in b t c, later Musk tweets something dumb and b t c goes down. Only harming himself. Only harming his company.
Their FSD is never going to get signed off because it has no clean data. 5 years of ML and they're still manually fixing edge cases like winding streets in san francisco, it's just not going to happen. it's taken so long for them to even get it into beta that mobileeye, the company they dumped because they delayed their camera-based FSD over safety concerns, has managed to build a camera-based self driving system that can also integrate into a lidar system. Rest of the industry is moving on while Tesla is praying that datamining will solve everything.
Someone selling calls.  Likely a hedge fund that expects tesla stock to not break $1,100
Even this comparison indicates to me that Tesla is overvalued. Apple‚Äôs P/E is 29 vs Tesla‚Äôs 611.
There's something to this comment. Maybe not 100. But the cheaper and as good shit is already out, musk has pissed a few of his cum gurglers off lately, it is definitely going to decline in foreseeable future. Still a good company. But I've also read that Tesla is the HFz favourite long position and burry shorted the shit out of it and he ain't a retard like us. So take from that what you will I guess. Crayons are still cheap so least you won't starve
Car quality is that of a Chevy. Delays on so many fronts. Also there are other players coming to the market. It's not the same Tesla 5+ years ago. Elon got too full of himself and tweeting stupid shit. He'll bring the ship down with him. Unless the board boots him out, which is unlikely at this point.
I am married and also lost 150k on tesla, what the wife doesn't know doesn't get you divorced...nice thing is I won't pay taxes on gains for a few years.
Personally I'm bearish on Tesla but I have no holdings in them. Tesla was like proof of concept for electric cars for other car manufacturers. Tesla's going to be the Apple of electric cars with unique charging ports, and a sleek design.
I am of the opinion that Tesla is going to the moon, I am simply giving a quick reason why people might think otherwise. Did you see how long the exploded Tesla was burning? Great battery. Bullish. üöÄ
At its current state, Tesla seems to be overvalued. Highest stock price for an auto company, but lowest market share. There's a lot of potential, but it could go either way depending on how crazy Musk gets. But it's a gamble and that's why we're here!
Tesla calls? Super cheap? I don‚Äôt think you know what the word cheap means, or rather your definition of cheap isn‚Äôt relative to this planet.
Alot of people don‚Äôt realize that $NIO will be bigger than Tesla, just do your DD you‚Äôll be speechless
Is it true that Tesla is now accepting 1st edition Pokemon cards as form of payment for their vehicles?
NIO has delivered the juice to my portfolio more than any other stock. I got scared and sold Tesla like 5 years too early and I will not do that again with NIO. In at $12, off at the moon.
While I'm as bullish on CLF as you are, isn't Gordon a garbage tier analyst?  He was a pretty big Tesla bear and he got cleaned.https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/gordon-johnson
11:00pmCentral Florida80F, clearI got a $10 haircut from a black barber shop in a derelict shack today. I've been cutting my own hair during the pandemic and wanted a fresh fade. He had a 4.8 on Google and had online booking. I had never been to a black barber shop before.I was pretty stoned when I pulled up and there was no parking lot, but the two gentleman standing on the porch were kind enough to direct me where to park. As I approached, they said "Damn bro you outta it" noting how stoned I was. They directed me inside. There was preaching on the radio, a TV with no signal, and about 15 people in this old 2-room house converted to a barber shop. This is considered the "historic" part of town. There was duct tape on the walls, and a nephew was walking around sweeping up hair. Several men came and went, and I wondered if possibly there was some sort of drug operation going on. I immediately felt at home.Rufus' nephew wanted to be an artist, but Rufus wanted him to be a football player for Tallahassee. I told him I'm a graphic designer and I run my own business and I showed him some of the digital art they sell nowadays on my phone. They all got very excited that art could sell for so much. Rufus had 2 cosmetic silver fronts on his teeth glistening when he'd look up to repeat a proverb. He got to talking about money and said he was on the verge of bankruptcy, but that Jesus will get him by. He had an impressive social media presence and was the top ranked in town, but 10 dollar haircuts in a shack don't pay well. He said he had a background in prophecy and told me to continue in the path of the righteous man.He gave me a fade and I gotta admit he was rough as hell. The sort of haircut you get in prison. His father, Big Rufus, made franks and beans in a microwave and sat down to eat in the corner chair. He kept dropping proverbs the whole time about how when the world knocks you down you just need to trust in Jesus to pick you back up. If the lord makes you a table, you sit down an eat. I tipped him a 50.I walked outside and Tesla called me. My car was delayed again, wouldn't be ready until tomorrow. I wanted to be mad, but I realized I'm blessed. I asked them if they could upgrade my rims for free for the delays. They told me to fuck myself.
Tesla quality ain't great but its hilarious to me that you bought a Jaguar of all things to replace it.
Turned all my Tesla shares into BB üöÄ. Here we go!!!
The year is 2031. Tesla flannel model is now producing 69 models a month. PLTR is $25
Credits to /u/ixamnis" Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.At the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I'm also going to include **EFA** and **EEM**. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. **EFA** is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and **EEM** is rated only 5.7/10. **EEM** appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. **EFA** appears to be more tilted toward the European market. **VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&ampP 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.There are also some sector funds you may want to look at:&amp#x200B**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them "electric vehicle" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.* ARKG - Genomic Revolution* ARKF - Fintech* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence* PRNT - 3D printing technology* IZRL - disruptive companies based in IsraelXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:* **XLV** \- Health Care* **XLK** \- Technology* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary* **XLF** \- Financial* **XLU** \- UtilitiesAt the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I'm adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**.  Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.Read through the comments below. Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF20% - VXUS - International20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund10% each in four sector funds of your choiceHope this helps.&amp#x200B*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*&amp#x200B**EDIT:**  WOW! Thanks for the awards and the positive comments.  I appreciate the feedback.  I hope this advice really helps some people."

Why try to trade Tesla when you could OWN Tesla with diamond hands
bro I hate the news tab on my brokerage  **Dave Portnoy Had Sex With A Robot. Here's What It Means For Tesla Stock.**
I think Tesla was weighted 1.4% of the index.
IMO the next crash is going to be caused by the "subprime" debt. Literally today money is free to get. Prices will go up and this will cause people taking on more debt. Regarding the stock market I expect more Archegos like blowouts. It would be nice to see how many people bought overpriced stocks (meme stocks for example) with leverage. I believe that many people bought Tesla for example with a lot leverage at some point and if they fall beyond that point people will get margin called massively, which will cause the bubble to burst.
Gather round and let me tell you the story of my first Tesla trade. The date: early 2020. As a young aspiring autist i deftly picked up 50 TSLA calls that were $200 out of the money for like .03 cents each. A few short weeks later they were $200 IN the money. I sold at a measly 20,000%. They closed at 40,000%. Dont be a paper handed bitch like me.

I'm not gonna lie it pisses me off that my ETFs make me buy some Tesla.
long time lurker in this sub. I don't even think I've posted before. But I joined to learn not about stocks, but how the puts, and calls etc work. I learned a lot. Enough, to know, that I need to stay away from it. I think my most vivid memory, is of the guy who lost a buttload of money, while recording his stream, as soon as the market open. the gulp he did was just wow.  anyways, I've also made some coin on some insight. mainly tesla and a half year ago, I stayed out of the AMC/GME fray, mostly because I really was afraid to let cashflow go away during a pandemic.  But now, since inflation seems to be on a runaway train, I might have to do some YOLO moves.  Thanks for all the long time members, who I got to observe, and make a few hundred off of, and thanks for explaining the finer intricacies of stocks.

#Incredibly bullish!Amazon country lead to become CEO. Amazon Financial Director to become CFO.Sales grow by 25%, top and bottom line improve.Beating estimates by 49% (that makes 2 out of 4 last quarters beat significantly, one hit, and one missed) And something that totally went under the radar: the **mainstream narrative is shifting**. Bloomberg wrote this: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-10/gamestop-s-latest-amazon-hires-show-it-s-not-just-reddit-meme-stock : GME is not a meme.And big market funds are buying into GME:https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-robot-run-fund-thinks-gamestop-stock-will-soar-in-june-and-predicts-a-fall-for-tesla-and-amazon-11623237670This is means we have moved past the visionaries (Cohen, DFV, Dr. Burry, DOMO, Chamath [still dont like him], Cuban)  to the early adopters (AI Funds, early growth funds, market leaders). It will be only a matter of time until a big time hedge funds will jump on the rocket ship, and very publicly so. I give it another quarter before that happens. And don't forget the Russel1K inclusion will buy tons of passive funds into GME.And if they report a profit for one of the quarters before q4, or even for the whole year, this will go ballistic, because then the SP500 is on the cards.If your tits aren't jacked yet, better buckle up.
Okay guys. Going to be transparent here. This is what I own and how much of it and why. LCTX - 14k (Cures blindness) SPCE - 3k (Maybe the next Tesla) TLRY - 1k (Gov. Policy changes on weed) PLTR - 1k (Cathie‚Ä¶ duh). NIO   - 1k (Chinas Tesla.. Too big to fail) Cash - 5k ( To buy the dips)
I $WISH i could of afford a tesla
#if Tesla isn‚Äôt (or gone through) $300 by the end of July I will take a 5 month ban.
Change my view: stock price is purely based on supply and demand. Supply and demand is driven by hype. Hype comes in many forms - fundamental analysis is just another form of hype.So what if Tesla or GME's price doesn't reflect your personal understanding of "fundamentals"? Fundamentals are only a small piece of the hype puzzle driving supply and demand. I would argue that market manipulation by big players has a FAR bigger effect on any stock price than "fundamentals"... Since it's practically consequence-free, hard (but not impossible) to detect, and easy to do with large assets under management and the right regulatory and media connections
Tilray and Tesla options ü§ë
I‚Äôm holding my positions in CLOV.The market took a dump yesterday, so it wasn‚Äôt any one specific stock that was affected. It was several - Gme, AMc, or Tesla, etc. - it‚Äôs really a matter of ‚Äòif it dumps again‚Äô that I will consider pulling out and taking a position at a lower price point.
Tesla. It's the classiest way to lose it all.
And the same goes for Tesla. You can‚Äôt look me in the face and say that teslas sales or forward looking statements justify its current value.Just because the price is high doesn‚Äôt mean its not true.
I remember comments like these when tesla was at $200 a share.
Tilray , rocket , and getting in on clf in morning. Have my eyes on inflation numbers and may jump in on some Tesla calls if it starts moving.
Ape is holding CLOV tomorrow.  Let's Squeeze CLOV till these hedgies get fucked! Ape wants to profit so can get a new side girl, and  buy new Tesla for wife's boyfriend!
I am soFucked I‚Äôm under 25k and restricted from trading... :( just need Tesla to go up like $10 and I‚Äôll be up at 25k again. Puts on myMental health otherwise
Can we go back to the spy and tesla days
Thanks! I had the exact same sentiment. This is the first post I've written, as far as I can remember, and I've lurked here since when Tesla became the original meme stock. I was very surprised to see no other posts on it.
Dude, that was like four months ago and it was semantics over what is an ‚Äúorder‚Äù.  Every EV car company, Tesla, Ford, etc. that hasn‚Äôt produced the vehicle yet still takes ‚Äúorders‚Äù.  All are non-binding.  You can order a Tesla truck today and cancel it tomorrow.  Same with Lordstown.  Guess what, I have an order in for a truck.  I put my $100 down and I am expecting a truck.  So don‚Äôt tell me they don‚Äôt have orders.
I am more concerned about tesla In the SP
I agree with you OP and it saddens me to see that honest questions get downvoted by upset fanboys you can't simply say "read the DD over at /superstonks" and think that's enough. That isn't an good answer, at least it should be possible to explain what's unique about the company, what's the moat and why can't the competition beat them?  Part is simple cultlike loyalty It's a movement not an investment, people want to "stick it to the man" and like the angry proletariat they ordinary people are rising up against the elite (hedgies). Another explanation would be simply loyalty to the brand, nostalgia from the days when it was truly a gamestore where you pre-ordered to get the new hot releases on midnight, where the staff were geeks who knew every detail and were happy to talk about games with you and be like a friend more then a seller.  Last but not least is the "moat". It's a decent enough brand, the CEO is a guy who's got experience and at least managed to create one successful brand although, as you say OP, that was easy mode compared to this. As far as I see this topic is very much the same as Tesla or for that matter Virgin Galatic, people try to make up all kinds of different bull cases and throw out hoping some stick. For tesla it's solar/battery/self-driving/ai/bodypillows and for gamestop it's games/funkopop/digital store/console-tie in/pc part picker/digital waifus/whatever and virgin galactic it's simply space tourism/colonize mars/everyone goes literary to the moon.  My humble analysis is that this is a store with serious issues. It's a relic of the past, when games were hard to find and geek culture was shunned/rare, today every other store sells games (especially online), geek culture is mainstream and every console has a digital storefront. As for Pc parts and all that there are already other, well established companies with loyal customers. Wherever Coen&ampCo tries to establish themselves they'll fight an uphill battle against established store physical and digital. Why would I go to them instead of use Steam/PSN? Wallmart or Amazon?     TLDR: IT's a movement. It's a good brand/Store name. It's a proven CEO willing to try new things. Though I might be wrong
If this isn't a good sign, I don't know what is!?!https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-robot-run-fund-thinks-gamestop-stock-will-soar-in-june-and-predicts-a-fall-for-tesla-and-amazon-2021-06-09?mod=mw_RHF
I request this AI be made an honory mod of wsb. Only a retard you sell of Amazon and Tesla to yolo on GME.
BB's QNX OS is in nearly all cars, except Tesla, and most of Tesla's autopilot issues stems from not having QNX OS's real time processing capabilities. I don't understand how BB isn't making bank.
Tesla has officially become a boomer stock
This stings because it's true. FiretrUCK Tesla
You mean my first week with options and Tesla??
Tesla fanboys will interpret the facts in whatever way looks best for Tesla lol.
Give it time, do NOT panic sell. I held 25k shares of ACB at the peak on Nov 9, watched it go all over the place until I could finally unload all but 1.5k shares this past March.  Turned that into 20k profit this year. Would have been 38k but sold some for 18k loss. Luckily had tesla, Apple and few others for a push at tax time so wife never found out. Be patient and the tendies will come!
Wendys is the Tesla of fast food
NOK NOKwhos there: tesla dip
Hilarious that people use Lordstown's non-binding pre-orders against them, and do the exact opposite for Tesla.
Yeah. Ford sells 800,000 to 900,000 F150 trucks per YEAR. It has been the number one selling vehicle year after year for decades. If they convert a decent percent of those sales to electric F150s and attract new buyers, then they are in a position to blow Tesla and all of these small pretenders away in the e-truck market. Only GM, Toyota, and Dodge are likely to even compete in this market.  Tesla attracts a lot of attention but its Cyber truck isn't even a real pickup truck
&gt I don‚Äôt see how Tesla missed making the truck look like a truck.He didn't overlook that. It was a buzz generating maneuver. Whether it pays off or not is TBD but it was a reasoned idea.
I don‚Äôt see how Tesla missed making the truck look like a truck. They all look the same for a reason. For someone so smart, Elon can lay a real hot one every so often. Somehow against all odds, Ford manages to be the only one who hasn‚Äôt screwed it up yet. Amazing.
I‚Äôve been invested legitimately into workhorse for almost 4 years. I bought 1000 @ $1.90 because I did  my research. When they hit $40/share I held.... when they plummeted back to $7/share I held.... this is a legitimate company with potential to become a 1/4 Tesla..... Do your pump. üí™
One of the most reserved vehicles in history is also hard to argue against. Even if only half of those orders are fulfilled. Half a million vehicle orders is worth tens of billions for Tesla over just a few years.
What color Tesla should I buy when I sell my CLNE shares after it hits $13?Red?  Or just get the free white and put a wrap on it?
Found out my coworker cashed out his 401k to yolo it into Tesla a few months back fuckin rip Lol, made me feel better about my tlry and gme losses
At one point Tesla made one vehicle at a time. Start-ups scale and they need capital. It's about the underlying tech, GM invested in them for a reason. GM is up over 50% YTD, part of which is because of their tech. This is their tech investment. Let's go.
Yea the thing that sucks is like okay, fine you think there's too many GME posts and you want the sub to go back to its roots, bring it back then. Squeeze plays and dynamics are so rare that they don't deserve the same "new" short squeeze play post over and over again. There's like 50 BB and 100 CLOV posts on here saying the same thing over and over again, even prior to GME they would've been deleted.If people actually want the sub back to its true roots then delete all non-closed position and all non-option play gain porn, accept only loss porn, and start banning doing temporary bans for potential bots if that's easier. I don't care that someone made 4k on CLOV shares when some big balled motherfucker made 40k on AMC calls that was 90% of their portfolio or some smooth brain lost 20k on Tesla calls
This thing is going to have stronger retard strength than Palantir. Only second to Tesla. This stock is going to be bonkers cuz the company itself is absolutely an incredible unicorn.
Another ‚ÄúTesla killer‚Äù bites the dust.
Wish is gonna explode tomorrow morning. Buy in today buy your Tesla tomorrow
Sell tesla buy GME.....that's 2for 1 right there.....not financial advice but were going to $1k baby!!!
Musk tweeted that Tesla will accept Wendy's Burgers as payment for Cybertruck.
So, your saying every EV except Tesla will be controlled by the BB platform. Then BB platform can be used to run railway and public transportation . Then Amazon will be using BB technology for drone deliveries across the US. Now your telling me it's only 16$ a share ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm).  Take me to teddies land!!!!!!
When will they terminate coverage of Tesla?
At $19 to accumulate 4x my money,  I think it's worth a few grand gamble.... I like BB. I think you are right! Only thing they need is Tesla or Amazon to pluck them up and then it will get noticed again.
So I take it you don't invest in any crypto either since China is the biggest miners of the world?I take it you don't invest in Tesla since Elon Musk openly praised Xi Jinping/The CCP and the way he runs the country? There is little to no ethics in investment...
Went from being able to buy a Tesla to a Toy car.
Been averaging down and sitting on 1k shares. Hit green for the first time today. Can‚Äôt wait to buy my wife‚Äôs boyfriend a new Rolex that matches his AMC Tesla.
Yeah Ev‚Äôs should do well, I‚Äôve heard of this company called Tesla do you guys know anything about it?
It's because Elon Musk says it's bad....and how many tesla bagholders will there be in a few years?
SoFi , I am all in, amongst my top three conviction stocks, besides Tesla and pltr.
Don‚Äôt let me down BB I‚Äôve got a Tesla to buy
Yeah, they are meme stocks &amp trash companies. BB actually has a decent product. The last meme stock to have a viable value proposition was Tesla.AMC &amp GME are trash.
I definitely would like to hear about your risk model and trading tactics too.I realized after i saw how tesla went all the way up for 8 months and i missed out on it that my risk model was way too safe and that i need to lean into a larger amount risk to make more money. Since then, i made a lot more profits and I‚Äôm extremely happy with my decision. So i want to hear how you operate so i can learn from you.
I think all of the senate and executive branch should be restricted to a blind trust. Too much of a conflict of interest otherwise. Those energy credits were how Tesla became profitable enough to enter the S&ampP 500, and she knew that energy credits were how Tesla scraped to profitability in previous quarters. I am sure she thinks that green energy is the right way I do too. But I believe that lining your own pocketbook with your elected power is bad. Had she legislated and *then* invested in Tesla, I would have no issue.
A lot of WSB bought Tesla before the run‚Ä¶ lol I am much more concerned with Purdue and Loeffler. I would also put Diane in the list she did shady shit around this time as well.
I have some of my best investments just buying in to stocks that nancy‚Äôs husband invests in. AB has done steller. He bought tesla leaps. I love this.
Hopefully Elon tweets some dumb shit this weekend so Tesla can drill on Monday
I've held BB stocks for 6 mos. Have no plans to sell. In the future where all EVs are using BB tech, this stock will skyrocket.Maybe at Tesla levels? Anything is possible.
Also imagine if BB clocks a cybersecurity deal with Tesla... not too crazy since Amazon already has a BB partnership
Yesterday: ‚ÄúTesla order in china dropped by half‚ÄùToday: ‚ÄúTesla may have had a blockbuster month in china!‚ÄùLesson: ignore the shitty media
Elon fucked with the coin again so I fully expect Tesla to have a deep red day
NIO IS KICKING TESLA ASS IN CHINA üá®üá≥ BAMMMMM,
WKHS makes box truck delivery vehicles and has a side project for autonomous drones called horsefly. The drone tech was a major part of ARK's bull thesis when they invested.The Oshkosh fiasco was not bad so much for it's loss of a contract, but because a large chunk of that grant was cash for upfront tooling and R&ampD, which workhorse could really use. Wkhs was an obvious frontrunner for the usps contract after Biden's executive order as it was the only EV option, but Trump's appointment of Dejoy was a long game that paid off and now we have a military tank contractor designing 90% ICE mail delivery vehicles for at least a decade. That all said, Biden's agenda for improving infrastructure will almost certainly provide opportunities for WKHS. If they can survive the tough grind of this cash intensive phase, they have a prosperous future.It's sibling $ride is focusing more on standard pickup trucks that are electrified. I don't see much market there until Tesla proves EV technology with the cybertruck. But $rides success would pay dividends for $WKHS 10% stake.
Hello fellow retards. I am a BBagholder converted long BBoomer and now back to BBig balls gang. All I can say is that in the dark dark last 5 months of being a BB shareholder, I discovered this thing is a fucking hidden gold mine. I am an early Tesla investor (bought 5 years ago) and this gives me the exact same vibes. I am holding this shit until 2025 at least. It has so so so so much potential.
This dude is short Tesla
It could be worse. I could be be bag holding Tesla lmfaoo.
Tesla is a retarded company run by an autistic retard. Academically brilliant but a complete lack of common sense
Wtf happened to Tesla? Did Elon tweet a dick pic or something?
Sold Tesla an bought $BB üöÄ
BB, let's go.  Buy me a Tesla and ring for my girl..... 1st things 1st though the Tesla ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Elon be like: Tesla getting blackberry security
No. they were long Tesla for a loong time, very publicly so too (since at least [ 2017](https://www.smarteranalyst.com/bloggers-corner/citadel-founder-ken-griffin-turns-bullish-dryships-inc-drys-tesla-inc-tsla-apple-inc-aapl/) ). Blackrock was short. There is a lot of speculation that those short squeezes we are seeing is blackrock sticking it to citadel exactly because of that
Actual Tesla? yes. TSLA stock? Also yes.
Holding GME and Tesla. Fomo‚Äôed into BB yesterday. How is my day going to be?
damn... a lot of ppl are short tesla
I repeat!!!!! Oh it was just like it was yesterday........there I was ....listening......learning.......STOCK GURU  and others pushing to invest In TESLA, NIO, CCIV, etc..... invest in companies you want to make money 10 years from now!!!!! ALL I LOST MONEY ON!!!! Then I began to hear the apes...and went all in on GME!!! AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID!..... Long live GME!!! Long live AMC!!! LONG LIVE THE APES!!!!
Sold all my Tesla and Nvidia and putting them into NOK and BB tomorrow morning.
Ok elon you know what you have to do, one free tesla for each tesla shareholder
You can search IKEA WORKHORSE TRUCKS to see photos of several already in service. No other manufacturer, including GM, Ford, Tesla, Oshkosh, Rivian, Arrival or Nikola, has this many electric last-mile delivery trucks already running on public roads. Yet they all have MUCH higher market caps! Plenty of room for WKHS to grow.
Grows life savings by 350% and then uses the money to buy a shitty Tesla. A true autist
should i dump AAPL and tesla for AMC calls at open?
I‚Äôll be bag holding Tesla and COIN while everyone becomes rich.
Take out a loan, yolo it all on tesla puts, tesla moons, suck dick for bus money, still walk, save money from dick sucking to pay off the loan. I'll be doing the same on friday too.
There is some intelligent conversation. They have been recommending ppl to buy GME and AMC for months and had you heeded their advice with even a little $ you would have done well. Same for Tesla and AMD.  Much better than  Seeking Crap/Alpha with publishes nothing but filler articles about stocks that do the opposite of what the authors expect and lose readers' money. Wallstreetbets may be bad, but it's way worse elsewhere.&amp#x200BThe experts, with their research reports and 6-7 figure salary analysts, are worse than WSB
Don‚Äôt think of it as a missed opportunity. You never had it in the first place. If you keep thinking of it I should, would have, could have, you will drive yourself crazy. In the early 1990 I was told about a small company that I should invest in. I had $18,000 and lived in Europe for 6 months. I had a great time. However, that little company up the road from where I lived was called Microsoft. You do the math. Earlier in the year before their split, I didn‚Äôt do a good job convincing the wife that we needed to buy Tesla. The money that was supposed to go to Tesla are in Reits that are down 5% since we bought. I bought Netflix at $20, sold at a $100. That was before they blew up and split the stock. I think each one is worth $2800. My friend tried to convince me to Bitcoin in the beginning when it was around $100.  Who knew?I even sold AMC, took the profit, reinvested my initial seed money. Sold it again today, and forgot to reinvest the seed money. That means if it blows up again, oh well. If I didn‚Äôt sell in the first place, I would be in a better position. At the same time, I bought Amazon at 20, sold at around 3200. And it hasn‚Äôt done anything since. As you can see, some bets pay off, some don‚Äôt. You can only do things that make sense for your situation, and sense of risk. You have to ask yourself what would have happened if AMC went to 0. Could you have afforded that?Investing is a long term game. This stuff with AMC and the others are just having fun. Its like going to Vegas. You go to have a good time. If you make money while having fun, great!
That's why Tesla and FANG stocks have such insane valuations. People want to say they own them.
&gt  you can go for stocks like Tesla, Walmart, and Apple That don't offer dividends but they constantly go up.0.40% to 1% each dayOh, you sweet summer child.
Elon gonna announce BB Brick Breaker for Tesla game store tomorrow
Orrrrrr the fact that a Tesla Model S is his dream car üòë
Imagine driving your Lucid Air to the Virgin Galactic spaceport and they‚Äôre showing a preview of SPCE on a AMC 3D headset with audio produced by BB all while powered by Tesla batteries. Staring DFV as your pilot. The year is 2040 and all meme stocks are now top Dow 30 companies.
Very sad that I still have money in crappy companies like APPLE and TESLA when I should be all in on reliable companies like GAMESTOP and AMC and BLACKBERRY
Selling all my tesla shares and throwing it all into AMC at opening
Lots of tech. Tesla leaps, SMH leaps, Nio leaps, ARKK OPTIONS. Everything got fucked.
And suddenly AMD is forgotten despite just partnering with Tesla...
Fuck Elon and his manipulation, BB IVY will dethrone Tesla in 2022
If you would have told me a year ago Bed Bath and Beyond would be a better investment than Tesla as of today I would call you crazy but here we are.
Imagine seeing Tesla at $18 a share. THATS WHAT BB IS RIGHT NOW STOP PLAYING
Holding 90 BB. I need my Tesla lambo already
I bought Tesla as my first stock ever in like 2010 at just under $20 a share. Parents bought some too and sold at around $100 and thought I was stupid for holding onto it. Still sitting on it
I bought Tesla fresh out of high school, 2012? I was told to sell at like, $150 by my uncle in finance. Glad I at least said fuck it and waited longer.
Been holding Tesla since 2016, so &lt$225. Throw in that 1:5 split... mmmm, tasty.
I've cried about what could have been when I didn't sell. Years ago, Tesla at $350. 2/3 of my AMC at $12.
This is your sign to sell Tesla and buy AMC
They said GME would never break $10 again, it did.          They said AMC would never break $10 again, it did.        They said Tesla would go bankrupt, it didn‚Äôt.           They said BB was dead, it lives.           They say Ford can‚Äôt break $18, I say it can break $Fordy.           This post was sponsored by me wanting to make a fordy pun.
I think Michael Burry was right about Tesla. This shit going down.
God I fucking hate Tesla with a passion
&gtHonestly, I just don't know anymore, there are plenty of meme stock whose value have no basis in profitability or traditional accounting.Taking AMC and GME as examples, while the underlying fundamental value of the companies may be very low, as soon as the stock price jumps, regardless of the reason or meme-ness, the company can wipe out debt, restructure, and survive for months when it was close to bankruptcy. This is a huge change in the fundamentals, and that is BEFORE you account for how a company can take a change in stock price to use for higher equity, loans, hiring new key people to redirect the company and create new value, etc. A lot of people throw around "meme" as the ending of a statement, a meme-stock might actually reflect a paradigm shift in value-investing, where todays newer generation sees potential value in failing companies, and by investing actually creates the value they predict- it is the beginning of a statement, not the end. It is both a self-fulfulling prophecy, and making value out of nothing, in a sense, but it is actually the same thing that has always gone on in the market. Berkshire hathaway buys 20% of a company, then the press announces it- what happens, everyone else tries to jump in, creating a rise in value. That is what most institutional investors want- just entering a trade will increase the stocks value, since a lot of investing depends on confidence (in your choice). I have just started learning to invest, but these things seem obvious, in the same way that people driving horse carts thought that driving a car is going to be a fading trend, or that amazon would never be big, since they only sold books, and these are the experts that think Tesla is overvalued because it only sells cars, when it is a tech company, etc.  &gtWe are in an era where Target had to stop selling pok√©mon cards because grown adults are pulling guns on each other due to being able to flip them the day they hit stores and double your money  &gt  &gtWe are also in an era where cryptocurrencies that were started as jokes are worth millions or billions of dollars on paper.Take into account that the US has created (this is paraphrased from online, verifiable sources) approximately 20-25% of all dollars ever created (in value, not actual dollars) just in the last year. You hear a lot of discussion on how theres too much "froth" or liquidity in the market, which is leading to the current bubble. If you think that the dollar is artificially high in value (true devaluation of the dollar is not being allowed to happen), what do most people do? Invest in hedges- silver, gold, or in this case crypto. If the US pulled back all liquidity, and allowed the dollar to rise in value 50% what do you think would happen- probably shift out of crypto/gold/etc.&amp#x200B&gtAll the stuff will be in the history books, the great lockdown, which is still on going with no end in sight for many countries, has radically altered both the economy and the psychology of the average citizen. Couple that with massive increases in inflation that are underway and it's no telling how long this can go on, so good luck trying to predict it.Agree!
TSLA is going to be like a fat zit about to pop. - Sold out in Q2 well before quarter finish- top seller in US by not a margin, but no comparison other than they're in their own league for sales.- Chinese public apology and acceptance of Tesla- over 1M cybertruck pre orders...- 500+ mile range as a standard- chip shortage? Temporary. Not the first time a shortage has been around, nor does it last that long... (especially these days when TSLA has enough capital to start their own supply chain...) - well managed - plans for the future, success, and impact in the world. - more than just vehicles- nearly $900 in January...*just my perspective based on comparison of other companies, what Tesla does/is doing, what happens in the manufacturing world. Looking at how the media is trying to keep Tesla out of sight and out of mind with Ford. Selling a lot in Norway is great! Just remember that there are more people in 1 state than in Norway, but congrats to Ford at the same time. Lastly experience through the manufacturing world of parts shortages, supply/demand meets and expectations. The experience also includes the results based on those shortages through the cause and affect.*Thanks for reading! Fun little add. I will note that I am currently all in for TSLA through this belief. Your decisions are your decisions, just my .02 of why I am a believer that TSLA will infect destroy the bear army. üêÇüéØ #tomars #tothemoon
$BB&gtTesla
Airbnb got the same issues Uber and etc have. Scammers and criminals are learning to game the system. People are renting spaces that look like great deals that end up being foreclosure or eviction properties and having vacations ruined or interrupted when they arrive. Properties aren‚Äôt the same as the pictures (one photo showed a apartment that had an extra window that didn‚Äôt exist in the unit they ended up in!) Airbnb tells you to ‚Äúwork it out with the host‚Äù first but if the host doesn‚Äôt respond and you spend a night there you suddenly don‚Äôt qualify for a full refund. It takes hours or days to sometimes get someone who will do more than ‚Äúwe‚Äôll escalate and get back to you‚Äù and then they get off shift and you never hear from them again.The internet is full of Airbnb horror stories and you can find shell companies run literally by convicted felons who are renting/buying properties with staged photos who take your money and run leaving a property in foreclosure or eviction (apartments that don‚Äôt allow short term rentals) and for you to sort out the mess with Airbnb.Airbnb isn‚Äôt the second coming of Tesla. They‚Äôre going to run out of investment capital if they keep having to eat costs and refunds for hosts that cheat their customer base. Treat Airbnb investment like Uber, there‚Äôs potential, but a massive number of issues under the surface threatening their business model that aren‚Äôt adequately addressed today.
Ordinarily selling your own stock to raise capital causes a price decrease because it dilutes existing shares and presumably says something about the poor condition of the balance sheet that the company can't find debt at a reasonable price. This was conventional wisdom basically since the beginning of investing.But now some cases like what we saw with Tesla last (?) year, "growth" stocks (hate that term tbh but best I can think of right now) selling into a strong market to raise capital can paradoxically lead to price increases. Probably there are a lot of reasons for this but it is a source of essentially cost free capital for the company and if investors really believe the stock is on a hot streak and has smart projects to fund with the capital it can be seen as an intelligent move by management which boosts confidence in things being bullish.
the truth is that setting up your spending habits ‚Äúproperly‚Äù takes like 4 hours max. It‚Äôs not even that complicated. - understand your situation- figure out your goals (follow the flowchart in this subreddit)- set up budgets and rules based on your current situation and goals (how much goes to debt every month, how much goes to retirement, how much can you spend on fun stuff, how much can you spend on food)People know how much they make but don‚Äôt know, for that income level, how much they can spend. That calibration is needed. Just because I make 100k a year doesn‚Äôt mean I can afford to get ubereats delivery every day, but that‚Äôs not obvious and needs figuring out through some budgeting exercise.  Or maybe I can afford ubereats everyday but that means I can‚Äôt ALSO afford a Tesla model 3, I can only afford a Honda Civic.Then once that whole exercise is done you can spend the rest of your time, the other 2000 or so non-work non-sleep hours hustling. 4 hours vs 2000.
The big reason why AMD went after Tesla first was because all car companies are desperately trying to copy Tesla. Just look at Ford's big Tesla inspired tablet in their electric cars.With this move, other car manufacturers will be coming to AMD to get the same thing in their cars so they can compete. AMD will not have to go to them. $$$

He started shorting Tesla back in December while Tesla was at $900. My friend he won already.
Tesla has never made money off of selling cars or selling anything for that matter lol they make there money off tax credits from the government for being ‚Äúgreen‚Äù
Good spin job. You‚Äôre accurate until you say it isn‚Äôt a bet against Tesla. It‚Äôs very clearly a bet against Tesla
The hardest part for competitors at this point in time is quality. Say what you will from reports and such but I've driven 4 models of EV's and nothing stands up to the Tesla current day.
Larger players like Ford with it‚Äôs new F-150 Lightning will eat Tesla in the vehicle category. Tesla‚Äôs designs are aging and still suffering from quality issues.
The Nissan Leaf is an old product, that‚Äôs why sales are going down.As someone who can afford a Tesla, I won‚Äôt buy it because it‚Äôs a shit car, made by a shit company that is impossible to get parts for if anything ever happens.  The new Audi E-tron fuck yes.
It's not difficult at all. Also, CHPT has been here longer and has many, many more charging stations. Superchargers are just like teslas, well branded, but not the first and not the best. My hypothesis: As EVs become more mainstream the novelty will wear off and competition will start chewing TSLA up. Positions: I own a non-tesla EV and charge at charge point and Volta stations.

This. I am fully confident that Tesla will be a great company eventually, but the stock price seriously does not make sense at this point in time.
That has always been the case in hard fact - working for a PR company for years - the crisis was ALWAYS to explain to the directors that if you focus the cuts on your advertising to save all the projects, you wont sell the projects. They have an idea that the product is "a real thing" and the PR is "not a real thing"  Look at the difference in in image between Tesla and General Motors..  why is that? = Because Elon is a meme-machine and knows it..   Anyone estimate what real HARD INCOME the "Elon personality" is worth itself, to his businesses?  A very serious percentage at least.
That's great and all but it's just another pie in the sky "TESLA ARE GONNA DO X" promise. You don't think General Electric and BMW are going to build charging networks too?TSLA bulls seem to think that Tesla is the only company in the world that's trying to make a profit. Do you think the rest of the industry is just sitting on their hands saying "nooooo gas only EV will never happen". They're all investing heavily into EV and the network around it.My cousin has a Nissan Leaf and he loves it. It accelerates like lightning and the range is enough for him to commute to work. Normies don't give a shit about false promises of self driving, they hear "advanced driver assistance" and they think "sounds great". They don't buy their car because twitter says so, they buy it because they test-drive it and say "comfy".
&gt The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).It's also a bet against TSLA. Not a bet that Tesla the company implodes, but that TSLA the stock will eventually drop to a value that is justified by the fundamentals and the projected future earnings. As it stands today, it's incredibly overvalued. Saying that TSLA is overvalued is not the same as saying "hurrr durrr it's a shit company".
What a lot of people are missing is the utility of the supercharger network. I agree Tesla is overvalued, but superchargers are money printers. They literally sell power for double what it costs them. They sell the car and the gas. Having a non Tesla is very difficult to plan a road trip around too, on the consumer side.
As the industry moves quickly towards towards EVs, Tesla is just like any car company. I'd take an EV from vw/Audi over a Tesla any day
Just bought 250k of Tesla calls.
\- I agree, IMO the answer is:  Tesla is **not** an obvious winner.  In old fashioned terms it has great PR (totally WOW GREAT man) and a charismatic in-the-news boss - a walking meme, and EVERYBODY knows the name. It's the new generation new communication meme-name in the industry, Brainchild of the Amazing Elon. This year's media personality. Definitely BLING. Ask anyone.On the other hand, who knows what Ford is doing now, except DD freaks?   Ford is boring, right?  ask folk in the street "what is Ford doing?" .. &lt&lter uh duh making cars. making ELECTRIC cars, self drive, whatever ??&gt&gt  So the bottom line is  WHAT is so great about Tesla?   Well .. it's LOUD and Colorful and it certainly promotes it's R&ampD like fuck.But the USA has OTHER motor companies. BIG SERIOUS ONES.  Have they all been sitting on their asses doing FA drooling for a year or so being jealous, or are they going for it?
I highly doubt Burry is putting that massive of a position in puts just because he thinks interest rates go up. I'm sure it is part of his thinking on how he can make money but he chose Tesla for a reason. He obviously is betting against the company regardless.
Are there not easier, less risky ways to profit from interest rates than to buy a massive amount of put options on a single company? I'm sure that's part of the equation but I have a feeling Burry believes Tesla is overvalued if interest rates remain the same. I mean we're talking about a company trading at an insane multiple that still isn't able to generate profits based off selling cars. Doesn't seem like a stretch that he thinks it is overvalued.
The fund owns puts, the notional value of those puts is 500mil. They didn‚Äôt buy 500 million dollars worth of puts. SAM‚Äôs AUM is 638 Mil. By your logic they also bought 165 million dollars worth of calls on Facebook and Alphabet. Where is all this money being spent on options coming from? Is SAM responsible for the entire OI for puts on Tesla?
Well said. Dr. Burry's approach to trading has always been to first identify the macroeconomic trend leading the markets and then finding the best thing to go long or short on based on his underlying thesis. Case in point on the Tesla puts.I'd like to add that Facebook and Google aren't just big tech companies with strong balance sheets, but they are also key players in the advertising space, an industry which will benefit from inflation as companies will want to pass their cost basis onto consumers, and in order to successfully do that, they will want to establish their brand image, this spending more on advertising.Also, these being software companies, they tend to have lower Capex so rising material costs will likely affect them less. These factors combined are why I think these companies were among the top picks for his portfolio, alongside his volatility plays.
Tesla is also worth 500 billion dollars and doesn‚Äôt make any money selling their products.By any normal metric, they are like still in a start up phase but is valued at 500 billion.It‚Äôs stupidly overvalued and running out of buyersIt‚Äôs literally a car company. Their solar roof thing like isn‚Äôt even real.
Tesla is 90% of my stocks i will see you in 10 years when i have 3 robotaxi slaves working for me.
You dont have to be a rocket scientist to see its overrated. How will tesla provide enough profits to pay a nice percentage of dividends over there marketcap? And dont tell me its there science. Even though they are ahead they are just ahead by a little. Volkswagen will be there in maximum six months if not volkswagen then another. In the meantime musk is playing poker putting his stocks down to borrow money. When it hits it hits hard. Does make me think about the dot com bubble.
I was looking at the Tesla truck.......ü§î I think a retard invented it
You‚Äôre kinda like burry shorting Tesla except he‚Äôs successful. You‚Äôre more like bill Hwang.
ARKG which had no Tesla did great, better than most public biotech funds.
Schwab has a nice mutual fund, SWTSX. Total stock market index fund, low fee (.04%), contains about 3,000 companies. Apple, Microsoft, even Tesla is represented in the top 10% of the fund since becoming part of the SP500. This is a good place to started a boring, life long investment plan. This is a good core fund to have. Keep this plugging away while you learn some more.
The NAME, literally the name of the company is there to trap people into thinking they are the next Tesla. This should be the biggest red flag. No legitimate business would shamelessly name their company like that. And to think this pos of a scam had bigger market cap than NIO and Ford at one point.
Tesla $850 bag holder gang
Its true soon will be nikola tesla ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)
Arkk was literally carried by tesla. 500% after the biggest bull run in history is nothing special considering most popular growth stocks are up 1000%+. Stop with the cope, you‚Äôre better off investing in individual growth stocks than a fund with a manager that was mediocre until 2020
Your Tesla is going to drive itself back to the dealership after your puts expire worthless and you miss your payments
I don't think they are leveraged. That isn't quite the word. Volatile is.I just think they buy newer companies that haven't traditionally been profitable, but are beginning to turn a profit or are close it and hoping they make it. It makes ARKK far more volatile, but they are betting on a few companies to make it big. Any small downturn in the market can spook investors, because these aren't companies with solid  long-term profitability yet and they don't have the profitability to match their stock price... just the long-term potential to.They mostly had their good year riding the coattails of Tesla.
If you like the car and it fits your budget keep it. Unless you‚Äôre going to go out and get another car for only your profit buying another used car won‚Äôt be worth it. You would be buying into the same inflated market. I wish I had kept my last S4 lease, buy out was 32 dealer has it listed for sale for 46 right now. The KBB price was only 34 when I had looked in Feb/March before my wife and I ordered our Tesla.

If we keep it tight and survive this long weekend, we will take the upper hand. I don't know about you all, but I'm not trying to make a few hundred dollars, I'm trying to buy my wife's boyfriend a Tesla. LFG. Stay strong. Scared money don't make money.
Tesla isn't just cars
Final warning Tesla bears get out now or face the music
I bought 300 gme calls today right before market closed that expire tomorrow which will most likely be worthless I paper handed my amc calls and could have turned 2k into 70k I also paper handed 592.5 Tesla calls and could have turned 3k into 20k Anyone feel my pain? I‚Äôm here üò™üò™üò≠ü•∫
Do you own a tesla? Have you ridden in one? Just curious since alot of your thesis seems to be based on ‚Äúwhat you‚Äôve heard‚Äù. Also, if you are confident its a bad investment, short it. Ill gladly by your cheap calls.
Tldr: "Tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns"
You can use options in a less retarded way than your average WSB member LEAPS, covered calls, cash-secured puts, etc. Plenty of ways to benefit from options without yoloing 10k on OTM Tesla calls expiring tomorrow
If I never touched Tesla my life would be so much better
GameStonk is a mature company in a dying industry.Tesla is growing company in a growing industry.SPCE is a infant company in an industry that didn't exist a decade ago. They have absolutely nothing in common.
Game Stop, Tesla, Virgin Galactic all have something in common.     They are all three overvalued, and the short ratio is on the rise. However, as long as some people are betting on the company's possible future and not going with the fundamentals, the short-term outcome becomes unpredictable. The question is who will win and who will lose.
Imma take one Amazon and one Tesla chop chop
Well, summer is historically a bullish season for Tesla.  Best of luck!
Everybody say that Tesla is overvalued. am I crazy if I wish in Tesla reach at least 1500$ before the end of the year?
Tesla is so 2020
Time to buy Nio and wait for the Tesla clones
The year is 2032.  You just purchased a house for 3.2 shares of $BB, which is about $100M in AmericaCoin.  You take a walk down the street and see Alicia Keys.  She's the brand ambassador for Apple.  She's rocking a $BB brain implant chip.  Don't tell Tim Apple.You hop in your Blackberry Tesla and head to the nearest mall, which has a Gamestop with a second hand copy of Crash Bandicoot for sale.  You kindly hand over $10K in AmericaCoin and refresh the GME stock price in your brain.  Up 2% since your purchase.
&gt‚Äúis this Tesla bubble artificially suppressing the price of better companies like TM‚ÄùWell it could be Tesla is overvalued, that doesn't mean companies like TM are undervalued.
Car manufacturers historically have had low P/E ratios. It is a competitive industry (many companies offering similar cars), low margin of profitability, high barriers to entry (I don't think Tesla is quite there yet as a competitor - it might in the future, but at the moment it only sells a small proportion of global cars sold) and high capital expenditure requirements (which makes them slightly riskier in the sense that they may spend 1 billion on a project which may turn out to be not viable). Tesla's valuation is not grounded on logic, it's based on the best case scenario over the next 50 years occurring within the next week (i.e. a lot of expectations have been brought forward and have been baked into the price). Therefore it doesn't make sense to compare Tesla to Toyota.
Elon's comments earlier this year on twitter and to investors were overstating capabilities of FSD and out of touch with reality / his own engineers.  Here is one article about it:https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggerationHe also pushed real hard for FSD Beta to be available widely and then had to walk it back.Plus, just go look at youtube videos of people testing the FSD beta in suburban and urban areas, especially unprotected left turns where it always wants to wait during a gap and T-bone the next car or pull out directly in front of it...  not to mention the times it misunderstands speed limits or tries to drive where there is no road when it gets confused.Elon is good at overstating shit and then hoping it plays out, but I think his luck there might be running out...  just look at how the Boring tunnel went from cool carts that zip around your car autonomously to an underwhelming and claustrophobic tunnel with trained taxi drivers.
If you‚Äôre asking how I lost so much.. Tesla battery day, EV market collapse, RIOT collapse, etc
"Customers who ordered before May 2021 and are matched to a car with Tesla Vision will be notified of the change through their Tesla Accounts prior to delivery."Some may have ordered already and won't get radar hardware...  No discount just a change after they ordered or does anyone think they would get a discount?  No radar hardware means cost savings to build right?  Isn't having radar more safe?
Wheres the facts. And no using Tesla or Amazon as comparison doesn't count as research.
Tesla is $500b toyota is $250b. Which one do you think is ACTUALLY worth more
Or just invest in Tesla like a normal person
I don‚Äôt read OP‚Äôs comment as saying Tesla has achieved their planned profitability model yet.
&gtTesla made it quite clear. They basically said we're building factories here, here and here and they will produce these, these and these cars at this volume and we are aiming for 25% gross margins.But...Telsa isn't profitable because of those reasons. The only way they found profit in their first year (2020) was through selling credits. And that plus bitcoin in 2021 Q1.Maybe they will eventually be profitable from their manufacturing - but not yet.
I have an etrade account that holds all my tesla shares,  would that be a better alternative?  I only have it because I'm an employee and that's how I recieved my stocks from bonuses and such so I've never actually used it before.  I just hopped in webull because it seems simple enough to use.
Im going to say what everyone is thinking‚Ä¶. THE TESLA TRUCK LOOKS LIKE TOTAL SHIT.
Thank you. I followed Tesla's business the last 4 ish years and I could see a clear path to profitably. Tesla made it quite clear. They basically said we're building factories here, here and here and they will produce these, these and these cars at this volume and we are aiming for 25% gross margins. Basic math told me they should be profitable given execution. The thing is, I don't see any clear message out of virgin galactic on what the hell their plan is. Do they need the tech to mature before scaling it to market? Is there some plan they are not telling us?
Sold all my Tesla and bought GME this morning. Pure luck and purely retarded
ü§´ don‚Äôt tell Tesla.
No problem bro. I just invested a small sum of $10,000 into Yolo options in [space weed moneyz] and now I'm rich as Bezos. My cab driver has his own Tesla. This is all 100% super true, and make sure to follow this influencer/DM for tips on how to be monkey rich üòé(sigh, that hurt to type but sadly these made up bullshit is popular, people believe it...all while OP is shilling "trading courses" /chasing ad money)
they are different plays, he held tesla puts for 5 min, and calls for 1.5 hrs today
HI IM CRAMER, WELCOME TO MAD MONEY, WELCOME TO CRAMERICA. WELL WELL WELL IF YOU LOOK DOWN THE LINE TODAY AT THESE PREMARKET CHARTS ITS LOOKING LIKE WE GOT A 60% CHANCE OF PREMARKET GAINS AND 69% CHANCE THAT I PRECAME MY PANTS. BUT THATS ALL FINE MY UNDERWEAR IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY HANES BRANDS TICKER HBI FANTASTIC COMPANY FANTASTIC PRODUCT AND CEO THEY REALLY MAKE MATERIALS THAT HIDE THE JIZZ STAINS FROM A TESLA FACE RIPPER
I bought tesla at 885$
Tesla was so 3 drugs ago.
The year is 2035, Tesla has succesfully commercialized space transport and NVDA offers 7D porn. Meanwhile, PLTR still at $22 without any split made for 14 years.
Is it true that Tesla is now accepting 1st edition Pokemon cards as form of payment?
Wow u are insane. Cramer said Tesla runs up after Memorial Day for last 10 years too Shit man hope it‚Äôs on ur paper trading account
I thought about you today as Tesla was going up.  My sisters financial adviser thinks Tesla is over valued by 500%Cathie Woods thinks it can go to 2000 in a few years.ily
Go buy a tesla with the doggy coin.
How the fuck do you have a tesla x, and p100d model s and have 800k laying around you can yolo on stocks ??
Judgement can still be enforced even if you don't react to it. Kinda like ignoring police saying you are arrested won't make you any less arrested. After the judgement is legally valid (i.e. appealing period is over) Tesla will get a request to pay the sum. If they don't, gov. officials will forcefully collect the amount in question.
*"Tesla didn‚Äôt respond to the lawsuit and the 30 owners behind the case were automatically awarded 136,000 kroner (~$16,000 USD) each in compensation unless Tesla appeals to the case"*So how are they going to collect since Tesla didn't even act like it's being sued?
Holy shit I‚Äôm up 9800 on Tesla today WOOO I MAYBE able to financially recover
They won‚Äôt be paying those Tesla owners a single penny. They will file an appeal and very likely win it as they were only found guilty by default as of now.
Tesla gets sued so the stock price rises 4%. Makes sense. Lol
It's so funny how people complain that the stock doesn't shoot up from news like that. Palantir has a market cap of 40 billion, this is less than 0.1 percent of that lol. Might aswell buy Tesla calls every time they sell a car
Ford is the new Tesla
All the TSLA bears on WSB have made me a huge Tesla bull. Buying the fuck out of it next week.
Yea I don't get the OPs though process, Tesla and Bitcoin only looks bad if you have the attention span of a month
Tesla too - look at that terrible 2 year chart. The only people looking bad are the ones who bought at the top recently
got head in my tesla maybe life aint so bad after all
is tesla fucked tomorrow?
I don't think anyone is betting on tesla failing, just betting on the valuation not being as absurd.
GM is a part owner of LMC.  GM is on the board of directors.   LMC has full access to GM‚Äôs supply chain.  There is a reason GM is building a battery factory right across the street from the Lordstown plant.  A major reason GM basically gave them their factory, which isn‚Äôt really talked about much, is Lordstown agreed to give GM their EV credits.  That gives GM a huge financial incentive to ensure LMC is successful.  LMC hired the same man who got Tesla to production.  I‚Äôm Bullish on the stock.
Dude stfu and let them buy puts. One of these retards has to be the fucker who always gets his bets wrong and as soon as he buys a put Tesla will go to the moon
Back 5-6 years ago she was VERY bullish on Bitcoin and tesla, both were given outrageous predictions by her that were considered outlandish much like what you‚Äôre claiming. And yet here we are, those each have established incredible new levels now that we consider lows but 5 years ago seemed outlandish and extremely bullish. Being right sometimes doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre right all the time but it doesn‚Äôt take much look at her history to realize why she has a following. As to who claims she‚Äôs comparable to buffet? I don‚Äôt know. They are different animals imo.
Got it. Buy Tesla Calls
Burry was wrong about Tesla like 3-4 times before he finally got lucky after the whole growth and tech sector took a huge dump.He shorted tesla at 550 and it went to 900. If you had followed him, you would have been margin called and blown up your account.It's easy to look smart when you have enough capital to eat a billion dollar loss and think you are skilled at the market for mistiming your short position by nearly 100%
Next headline: Elon announces in a tweet that tesla will now accept STOPELON as payment
EXACTLY...TESLA WILL ROCKET TO 2000 EOY...ALL ABOARD
I hope this works out.  I want to see a Tesla on the road with license plate "TSLAPUTS"
Damn I just realized Tesla is fucked from beetcoin tanking. Puts on Tesla
They are a battery storage integrator, controls integrator, and software provider. In other words, they have the ability to do the battery storage design, procurement (from other vendors), and controls system design. Being able to provide the controls system design - telling the battery when and how how to run - will be a service that is much desired by developers, utilities, and EPCs.Tesla provides a similar service, but only at residential and huge commercial (multi-MW). Stem seems to be a good bet to fill the gap in between the Powerwall and the Megapack.Stem will also be paid a monthly fee to operate and maintain the battery after installation.
Cathy wood yolo on Tesla and it hit jack pot that why people are worshiping her lol
Now is when you go long tesla
Shorting tesla now is the same as buying gme at 480.Godspeed
You also forgot to mention their latest changes to their rooftop solar products. Tesla is now only selling you solar panels if you buy batteries along with the solar panels. When you think about the fact that they are already building massive lithium ion battery peaker plants, and they already have the software needed to balance the grid by buying and selling electricity, and now they are forcing their new solar buyers to also buy batteries. You can try to start putting the pieces together.I think Tesla is trying to build the foundation for a decentralized energy storage and distribution system with homeowners that own their products as well. Especially in areas like California that have a large number of Tesla solar products, sunshine, and expensive electricity prices, which is the perfect combination to try such an idea.
Tesla will go up to $1000
Collapse of the fastest growing auto maker with the most innovative technology? Every other car manufacturer is buying batteries second hand and Tesla is inventing new batteries with better range and manufacturing them themselves. Fucking dream on dude. Stock price correction? Sure. Maybe. But the company itself is in VERY good position as the EV industry leader.They‚Äôre not just a car company. They make cars, batteries, and software. That‚Äôs 3 companies in one. Vertically integrated.
I will be homeless if you buy that model X, because I will sell my house to put that money on Tesla stock at that price.
Not true, Tesla is everything China wants. A paradigm perception shift from garbage cheap exports to quality large manufacturing exports. And China state media has been consistently smacking the fake news who is trying to undermine Tesla. China has rolled out the red carpet to Tesla from the beginning, as the only wholly owned foreign auto manufacturer.
Literally everyone is buying a Tesla with Tesla puts. Bullish.
Tell that to all the people who shorted pre-split with the same opinion as you. Tesla is one of a few stocks on my "DO NOT SHORT" list
Tesla still got those coins?  If so, how do you think they will do in tesla stock if their coins become lower than they bought it as?
To scale up batteries to grid levels is going to take some time...but they are doing it. Tesla has the lead on batteries, and I would agree long term they will be in the power business....but that could a decade away. Further Tesla as an investment has been a flier, but not sustainable. BTW I said that about TSLA when it was 200 prep lit-so what do I know. I have enough of it in the 500 funds TBH.
Tesla. They designed their autobidder software to deal with rates to charge grid scale batteries cheaply and sell for higher prices as needed. Australia consumers saved millions of dollars from peaker plant rate spikes while still being highly profitable using Tesla grid scale batteries.Right now Tesla is selling their batteries to grid companies, but the real money is becoming a player in that field as it is. If their batteries can last 20 years, but get paid off in ten, then the rest of the useful life would be almost entirely profit. In general, Tesla could make more as a power provider then selling cars since they are an energy and battery  technology company that also sells cars.Grid scale batteries will have exponential growth rates this decade and Tesla will build as many as they can based on the battery supplies they can allocate towards it.
Don‚Äôt forget to show the loss porn just as many others before you have attempted the Tesla short and failed miserably.
Cathy holding $987M of $coin and its her 9th largest holding across her ETFs. For comparison, tesla is #1 with $2.9B....conclusion - she is so fukt tmrwü§°
Exactly this. When I was buying TSLA in 2014 I told myself the same thing. Even if I lose money hopefully my "donation" will transition people to a better world. Now that tesla has successfully convinced the world to make electric cars, I am moving on to space/genetics the two most important paths of tech in the next decade.
Not every short is worth squeezing. And Tesla is overpriced.
Imagine actually thinking tesla is worth 10 fords
Nah, this is gonna go $100+. Tesla 2.0
Tesla seems more like a battery company than a car company. The car is just a big ass battery with wheels. The Tesla power wall is sold out for like 9 months. If they reduce the price of their battery to a level that is competitive with standby generators they‚Äôll expand the market by quite a bit.
Tesla is only going to go down as they lose market share it‚Äôs inevitable unless he makes flying cars
Hasn't this guy posted Tesla crazy bets before?? I smell a sadist lol
I would‚Äôve but im dying with my Tesla shares.

&gtinto good fundamentals and cash flow stocks (fb, google, appl, tesla, arki, arkg)this comment shows you don't know what you're talking about. please don't invest on margin, you'll ruin your life.
yeah maybe. I stopped trading tesla for a reason lol.
You could‚Äôve bought yourself a Tesla with that money üôà
Yeah well, that was before Michael Burry invested half of his portfolio on buying Tesla puts.Hint : market is going doooown.Well not down, merely correcting itself. Alot of stuff was overpriced.
Bought 5 call options with a strike price of $900 for average price of $135.85. A call option represents 100 shares so he paid $13,585 for each of the five options. So $67,925. The options are currently worth $1.97 and will most likely expire worthless, though in Tesla world you never know.
LMAO Tesla needs to go up 90% in a month for him to break even
I bought this back in February when Tesla was sitting around 850$. Thought it was easy money. I was up about 10k the following week but it‚Äôs been downhill ever since. üò©
I take my model 3 on 4000+ mile trips spanning a dozen states. Let‚Äôs see a Mercedes or an F-150 lightning do that. Tesla is great but it is great because of the supercharger network and the ease of long trips. Range anxiety is gone. I am buying more.
Only problem with that thesis, is that Tesla is not a car company. They are tech. Also, look into the debt all those automakers are carrying, and think about how they're going to have to scale into the EV market with even more debt. Tesla's a decade ahead of them
Yet again I fuck with 0DTE Tesla option and escape rich ü§ë
Ford is finally on its way to a fair value in the EV space. The f150 is just the beginning. People retarded if they think Ford was just gonna fold and let Tesla dominate EV‚Äôs. Ford to $20 EOY.
RIP to all of those who said they were FOMOing into tesla calls at open
SEE YA LATER TESLA BEARS. LMAOOOOOO
I dont have a position in tesla but burn those fucking puts, all of them.
My tesla calls are itm in premarket.   Will probably expire worthless.
Tesla calls, and maybe a few more tesla calls
Tesla opens at 600
Apply for CEO of tesla.
No doggy, no PLTR, no Coin, no Tesla. This guy doesn‚Äôt fuck (much)
Are you retarded? This is why you never FOMO on $TSLA. You buy it when there‚Äôs blood on the streets and nobody wants it. You sell when everyone including your dead grandmother is bullish on Tesla. History repeats itself all the freaking time!!! Just look at the charts. Price target for entry at $400 and then we‚Äôre off to the races for $1000 Q1 2022
Tesla 700 EOD? 600 EOD? Very Bullish
I‚Äôm gonna buy a Tesla and charge it with a gas powered generator.
If TESLA goes back to 800 ever again I will buy everyone who comments on this an escort (holding 400 shares of TSLA @750üò≠)
Not to mention that models S and X are a tiny fraction of their sales. Like, they sell like 20k combined annually and they sell like 300k model 3s. Tesla may very well go to 400 because it's severely overpriced, but it won't be because of the 20k sales they're missing out on with models s and x.

Yes, but he also said Tesla robotaxis would be roaming the Earth by now
Model x and s are not where they make the most money. A very smaller percentage of people buying a Tesla buy the x or s because the cost is too high. If the y or 3 shipments were getting delayed then I'd be worried
gonna need a "tesla too low imo" tweet tonight
Several times. Its way to expensive. The Tesla is most likely just a benchmark for the Lidar system.  Not necessarily Tesla doing the test.
HAHAHAHAHA YOU STUPID BERS I MADE 15 BUCKS ON TESLA AHAGAH GO CRY BITCHES
Imagine how retarded you have to be to think Burry hasn't already made the big money off his Tesla shorts.
Thinking about shorting Tesla to make it start it's recovery
Nah tesla has 542B market cap, 0% chance and I‚Äôm a optimistic retard
Retail only has power over stocks that have sub 5B market caps. Retail couldn‚Äôt do shit w tesla
I think Tesla bull run is over for the time being. Too much new competition, production issues, China geopolitical risks, and bad press. I think TSLA bleeds slow the rest of the year
I think people just don‚Äôt understand. Tesla is the iPhone of the ev industry. All the other ev I‚Äôve checked out are shit. It‚Äôs obvious.
Tell me why you think the price is justified at $620?Taking current earnings, assuming a correct P/E ratio of 25, Tesla is worth $17.50 a share.Taking future earnings, assuming a correct forward P/E ratio of 25, Tesla is worth $56 a share.Auto companies currently have a P/E ratio of about 10 to 15, so those are very optimistic, bullish figures already.I have yet to hear a real justification for Tesla being priced at even $100 per share. I'd love to hear one.
TESLA
Imagine thinking Tesla was a good buy at 900
If Tesla doesn‚Äôt go back to 750 by end of year I will live stream myself ramming a cucumber inside my bum for all of you to see. So y‚Äôall better start buying
You mean Tesla right? Or the bitcorn?
VW is spending like 30 Billion on electric cars over the next decade and Tesla is somehow worth more than all automakers combined. It's astronomical.
I love tesla and all, but Ford completely sold me today. if you don't believe me, than think about the fact that if this line is successful, we are gonna see a soon to be future where you and the boys are sippin nattys fresh out of the fridge and roasting sausages on the Barbie while sitting in the flatbead of your truck as it drives down the interstate.
Tesla will fly to $2,000 EOY
Uh his short position on Tesla started Q1 so it's already hella profitable... He also called GME... He's not gotten "one call right once." To pretend like he has is ignorant at best.
How the fuck am I gonna afford a Tesla now? Elon keeps crashing everything I‚Äôm invested in.
Finally, the Tesla porn I‚Äôve been craving.
Hyperinflation would cause everything to rise including tesla. For him to be right,  there would need to be a break down of civilization which would null his paper ownership and we would move to a local warlord economy. He wouldn't make any money from it and would most likely be eaten by the mob. Sure the crap he's invested in can go up but compared to rest of the market I highly doubt it.
Musk has created multiple billion dollar companies. Burry got one call right once. His current investments are water, gold, farmland, and shorting tesla.  Hard to say this guy is the real deal.
Morningstar considers Netflix as 95% overvalued. Tesla is worth the risk at the prices that ARKK paid, they could rule the world one day.  Gene editing is the future and each success in the many steps forward to achieving a product will see a stock spike.Some thing like ARKK has a place in everyone‚Äôs portfolio.  When investing in high growth the goal is to buy 10 stocks and hope just 1 hits it big, it is clear that Cathy is more likely to find those 10 baggers than most of us.
Don‚Äôt be poosies. Tesla will fly again soon.
Elon shouldn't have fucked with corn gang, who are literally the same people that make Tesla trade at 10x its actual worth.  Serves him right... but I'm sorry for your loss.
Tesla up $1.95 after hours. all in 800c 5/21 tmrw, who‚Äôs with me?!?
She predicts CoinBit $500,000. -- Crazy, but not impossible    She is all-in on Tesla. -- Probably not advisable     She thinks gene editing is a sound investment at this time. -- The future of the biggest industry on earth, can't think of a better bet to make    She has decreased her position in Netflix. -- In the middle of their best case scenario (a pandemic where people were forced to sit at home) they made less than $3 billion profit on a greater than $200 billion market cap. Very clear short case.&amp#x200BSo based on your comments, two of which make sense and two of which don't, I guess you think flipping a coin is the investment strategy for you?
People keep saying that Tesla bulls are fuk.. Tesla is so heavily shorted that i‚Äôll bust thru 1000 in a week when it‚Äôs squeezed and yes it will squeeze. They couldn‚Äôt even keep gme in the double digits. Tesla is nun but a brutal growth company. Cathies Arkk got over 2 billion worth of tesla shares. You think she‚Äôs just stupid? Nah she knows something you don‚Äôt. If they can hold 2 bil worth of a falling knife why wouldn‚Äôt u hold your 10 shares?
Tesla bulls being hit by the Holy trinity of disaster. High inflation massacring growth stocks.Company not making a profit.An autistic CEO.
I missed out on the Tesla cult that could have made me a multimillionaire if I had invested in it a long time ago, ain‚Äôt gonna miss this cult if it‚Äôs gonna make me a multimillionaire now. Cults that can make me a lot of money are the good kind
No problem man. Everyone's been calling Tesla a bubble, but the Dow Jones is the real bubble.
For such a hyped company Tesla makes some ugly ass cars.
Im buying Tesla bcuz Elon tweeted üíéüëêü§°
Riding my Tesla calls to zero. It‚Äôs a pride thing now
Elon could shoot one of his Tesla employees in the middle of the factory and fanboys would still buy his shitty stock.
Looks like this guy has some Tesla calls he wants printed...
Is Burry excited today. Nope. It's a business and his Tesla short (via puts) is not really that big a deal to him.Cathie? She is shitting bricks, looking for the xanax and probably already drinking.
Nah that just means your a tesla investor
So now China has stolen Elon‚Äôs IP they don‚Äôt need him anymore. Tesla sales in China down 27% in April and Shanghai gigafactory expansion shitcanned üá®üá≥
If you still own Tesla shares I‚Äôd say keep them at this point.Think of all the people that panic sold Enron instead of holding on to that memorabilia, eventually they have to be worth something as collectors items
"I like this setup" - Cathie in May."Never bet against America. Our holding time is forever" - Buffet after selling airlines at bottom in last March. "We are accepting Bitch money to buy Tesla" - Musk 2 months before dumping everything.
I wanna buy puts on elon. Not tesla.. just elon himself.
Who wants to bet Tesla sold their stake in the forbidden electronic funny money?
Cathie Woods: My price target for Tesla right now is eleventy billion dollars
Not sure, but Burry has been on record for being bearish on Tesla for a long time now. He definitely started shorting too early (well before Tesla hit $700/sh post split) but its hard to say if he's green now.
Tesla calls whose loading up üöÄü§´
So clearly you're new to Robinhood if you think that's the only issue people have with it. Though they claimed they're programmed to deal with leap day, they've had outages for the last two of them.https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcoaev/and_now_a_brief_flashback_to_four_years_ago_where/Not to mention every time Tesla had an insane day early last year it would go down and people would be unable to trade. It's genuinely a shit service, with shit customer service.
Tfw you realize that Elon Musk is MUCH more of a Thomas Edison than he is a Nikola Tesla
I don‚Äôt like bears, I love Tesla bears, I like bulls, I don‚Äôt like Tesla bulls
Fuck it. Tesla calls.
Tesla the short squeeze we didn‚Äôt know we needed
VOO, VT, and VTI are providing very little *trading* volume into Tesla. Shorts are "fighting" the 35M daily trading volume that determines the current price of Tesla. Index funds are responsible for very little of that volume.
VOO, VT, and VTI are fine.  I was just saying that since Tesla is in the SP500, all the people buying those funds every paycheck are buying Tesla.  That makes it harder to short Tesla because there are lots of buyers.  That was the whole premise of the article -- passive buyers are creating bubbles.
Tesla is wayyy overvalued.
If Tesla crashes the entire market will crash. Tesla giveth , Tesla taketh.
Too much confidence in death of Tesla. Call are back on the menu üòé
I'm sorry but usually when everyone at once is writing off a company like tesla all at once I like to buy
Been doing my own businesses and trading full time over the last few years. Started a job at Tesla 2 weeks ago, hated how tedious it was while making 3x less income and working longer dreaded hours. I just quit lol. I‚Äôm back.
Screaming for my Tesla calls
Tesla to $400? Elon shat the bed hard
My man over here is talking about Tesla on a UWMC thread
Might be a tesla 100$ up day tomorrow.
Tesla is lightyears ahead of any other company software wise. Batteries too, you‚Äôre just speculating.
Michael Burry‚Äôs has half a billion dollars in Tesla puts ü§£ I‚Äôm buying the dip!
Fuck, that‚Äôs even worse. 40 billion dollars were lost betting against Tesla in 2020. But I‚Äôm sure you know something nobody else does
Lol good luck with that. Burry bought his puts when Tesla was $900.
If Tesla and AMC squeeze tomorrow, I‚Äôm going to be a happy lady
Let‚Äôs fuckkkkkkinggg go holding Tesla 300 puts
GME will/is squeezing like Tesla. Tomorrow will be the squeeze just like the past 3 months were the squeeze. The powers that be will not let the whole market explode just for an exciting short squeeze. This will be a drawn out affair but GME will be much higher than today in the next few months.
The bet is on the change in value of $534 million  worth of Tesla stock relative to a specific level and for a specific duration. If the stock ends up below that specific level during that time, then the bet pays off. Otherwise it expires worthless.Ok admittedly that‚Äôs for 10y olds.Now let me try ELI5: Just because it says it‚Äôs a big ice cream, doesn‚Äôt mean you get it all. You only get what‚Äôs dripping from it if you tilt the cone a certain way for enough time.
Imma guess by downvote volume that errybody shorted Tesla again üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíµüî•The number of times I‚Äôve seen this sub short the bottom ü§°
I'm a Tesla bear but they've actually secured their chip supply chain before this mess
Probably up way more than 20%. He bought puts probably when Tesla was 800+ and it‚Äôs sub 600 right now. Tesla would have dropped around 30% and his puts would have increased in value by a lot more than 30%
Wait...are people shorting Tesla NOW because Burry's Q1 filing had him shorting Tesla?  So Burry could have literally dumped everything during this massive dip and made tons of money and people could be filling up their bags with puts that Burry wouldn't even buy?
Seems like he timed it pretty well this time. Tesla is down from when he opened the position.
Yes Ford is also a modeling agency. And you think Tesla is crypto rich?  Fiat has most of the world's currency and stored value
Why Tesla puts are stupid:TSLA 500p expiring Jan. 2022 was worth $6500 mid February when TSLA was $800. It's worth $7500 today. Up 15%. Meanwhile the stock is down 28%If you bought something more daring like TSLA 400p, you are losing money.
I‚Äôm inclined to agree with him. Tesla is massively overvalued in the public market, and Elon‚Äôs recent shenanigans with him manipulating Crypto shows he‚Äôs open to do anything to keep the gravy train going for as long as possible. That to me shows desperation and insecurity. If he believed so much in Tesla there‚Äôd be no need to manipulate the market as much as he has already. Just my two pennies.
Tesla is more than a car company but not like Amazon is more than a retailer.
&gt communications company (starlink), space industry (SpaceX) and eventually a terraformimg a company a couple of decades from now.$TSLA has nothing to do with any of this.If you‚Äôre buying Tesla stock because SpaceX is successful, you need to put your money in a long term mutual fund immediately because you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing.
Starlink and SpaceX are not the same company as Tesla they just have the same owner. Also what major company doesn't make software?
SpaceX and Starlink are not Tesla though.  They‚Äôre completely different companies.  Isn‚Äôt Starlink planning it‚Äôs own IPO?
At this point, Tesla is a lot more than a car company, the same way Amazon is more than an online retailer. But I make no claims as to the  value of its stock. There are too many weirdos both pro and anti Musk for any sense to be easily derived anywhere.
people don't want to hear that right now. they are all rabid over cryptocurrency. in my opinion VW is the only contender viable against Tesla, and they are probably 3-5 years behind.  people think because gm/ford say they are going to make EVs, thru will exist suddenly. EV supply chain has to be built. batteries don't materialize from no where.  but at the moment, it's "cool" to be anti-Tesla.our Tesla is our primary vehicle. we've taken it on summer vacations that are an 8hr drive from our house. 15min charge time is the time to walk and stretch my legs after driving 4hrs.  it seems to be that all the other companies are treating EVs as a second car. I don't want that.
To add some nuance - Tesla bought bitcoin, insanely profited on bitcoin, sold 10 percent to beef up their earnings bc they sunk a ton of money into R and D this year. I think this is a wise move as earnings are still positive, and they're positioning to compete with oncoming EV makers. Tesla also needed to apply to the energy credits program from the government to help with earnings. Could potentially why they are no longer taking bitcoin for payment - to protect against environmental criticism, as it takes a lot of energy to mine bitcoin (but still less than if you were mining gold). Tesla stated that they are looking at blockchains that use less than 1 percent of bitcoin mining energy. Many are thinking this hints at ethereum as it's the second largest blockchain which will transition to a different system of security which will in fact use 1/2000th the energy of bitcoin.
&gt selling my new tesla shares when its breakevenAhh the old Sunk Cost Trap
Tesla has an army of fanatics on Reddit that will buy up the stock to spite short sellers.   Think, Michael think!!
Have you read about working for Tesla? Lol
Yeah, it says he owned 8k total put contracts. Tesla has a high premium on all their options so it definitely wasn‚Äôt cheap, but it‚Äôs probably only a couple million dollars at risk if he‚Äôs wrong instead of the 500m the media is running with.Also, this is information from March holdings, who knows if he‚Äôs still holding this position two months later.
Other manufacturers are quickly catching up, honestly feels like Tesla is at a standstill right now while companies like VW are putting their massive weight and resources behind EVs. The "old guard" is coming in hot, Tesla needs to actually release some new shit soon or their goodwill is going to get gobbled up.
"Famed investor Michael Burry on Monday revealed a short position against Tesla worth more than half a billion, **in a regulatory filing.**"First rule of not getting fucked in pound me in the ass federal prison, don't lie on your regulatory filings.
It's simple you fucks, Burry is buying puts on TSLA because the market is about to experience a massive correction and Tesla is overvalued. What is the catalyst for this crash? The fact that all of these institutional investors are overleveraged to the tits just like Archegos and have shorted everything to shit (see GME). All this rehypothecation is about to make this bull market come to its climax and the apes are all going to end the day in Lamborghinis. This is your final warning to buy GME or experience life crippling FOMO.
Henry Ford was known for having paid his workers enough to afford one of his cars. I've always thought Musk might've had a similar approach: pump his stock enough that his retail investors could afford a Tesla.
Tesla has a really nice business card tho
Let's see Paul Allen's bet against Tesla

Check out Lucid dude. CEO is former lead engineer of Model S (that Musk now denies, even though he has the business cards to prove it haha). Cars are luxury like Tesla will never be.
Tesla bought a bunch of bitcoin, announced they were going to take it to buy cars, rode it up, sold a bunch, then announced "On second though, nope" and it dropped.
He said he was shorting Tesla months ago. Just Google his name.
Tesla's build quality is inferior when you compare them to other EVs. Owning a Tesla is just a status symbol at this point. They were the first to produce a nice looking EV in an affordable price range. This will not be the case in the near future.
Yeah you‚Äôre correct, I was just making an approximation based on their value given of $530MM in notional value/100 since they‚Äôre options. This article in general is just more FUD for Tesla since Burry has been short or talking about being short Tesla for a while now.
&gt A pullback from an ATH like that is obvious to anyone with eyesA 35% pullback? Really? Do Cathie Wood and the ARK lovers not have eyes? Do you? Did you short Tesla when it reached $900?
13Fs require puts and calls to be reported but not short positions. I have also been short Tesla (with laddered puts) for a few months and have enjoyed conversations in stock chats here (r/stocks , /stock market etc , I just posted numbers and they called me all sorts of things , then they said ‚Äúlighten up dude‚Äù . I hope they are well. We will see.
Yeah. He did bet against Wall Street. Both in the housing crisis and with GameStop. Elon musk is just really good at getting scientists and engineers to make things and raising money for things most people are afraid of. Tesla is a car company that has far too high of a market cap and not even close to enough sales to justify it.
&gt was going to buy tesla with my profits. not happening in the future.because you've decided not to... or because there are no longer any profits?
was going to buy tesla with my profits. not happening in the future.porsche and bmw are coming out with some pretty nice electric cars.selling my new tesla shares when its breakeven
Am I? Traffic and transportation make up only 16% of all global emissions and this includes planes, trucks, ships, freight traffic in general. So you can imagine how tiny the amount of emissions are that are caused by individual cars of normal people. Just for comparison: Industry production makes up 31%, producing energy 27%, agriculture 19%. Electric cars are important and it is great that companies like Tesla and others are making great progress here but they will for sure not end global warming
The best chance at winning the right against global warming is Tesla. I knew this sub was about being a degen but sure degen'd too hard.
Tesla shot up almost $10 as soon as I bought a put ü§°I‚Äôm gunna wake up tomorrow $300 poorer.
Even Elon himself said the Tesla stock was way overvalued himself. People jumping hates money. I mean com‚Äôon this was bound to happen sooner or later. It went from $80 to $800 in less than one year time. Nothing goes up forever. Com‚Äôon.
Not "more" profitable. Without it, Tesla isn't profitable.
Not really. If you look at Europe Tesla's been battered and now it looks like they're going to be battered out of China too. Competition is heating up and Tesla is one huge bubble waiting to burst.
40% of burrys whole portfolio in tesla puts is pretty fuckin wild
Fuck Musk he's dead to me.  I believe in EVs and wanted a tesla, but I will get another gm.
why. he handed his trade secrets over to china. its over for tesla
Well now he‚Äôs closed out his position, people will scream ‚Äúsell Tesla sell Tesla‚Äù and they will, bottom will come and Tesla will begin the pump cycle all over again.
The problem is he surely knew crypto was an environmental problem before he bought it. Then he sells after pumping it and hyping it. Turns around with a lame ass coverup for his pump and dump.Crypto literally helped Tesla beat earnings this quarter, not their products.
Whoever added Tesla to SPY should go to prison lol
Bears celebrating Tesla was added to SPY.It's like an anchor now.
Tesla does not make money from operations. They make unsustainable profits from crypto pump &amp dumps and regulatory credits. They're gonna tank hard AF when the market corrects for them not making any money from operations
regardless of how one feels about elon, it's hard to disagree about tesla being overvalued. in context with other auto companies it is clownishly overpriced.
Ya but I also wouldn't short tesla. Going to just stay out of this fight I think.
Musk has repeatedly called for a carbon tax, but until there is one, he‚Äôs selling regulatory credits to make Tesla more profitable-I think Burry is missing the point that this is Musk gaming the system while calling for reform. I wouldn‚Äôt bet against Elon.
&gtTry reading the actual OPAnd you need to read all of what u/goldcakes commented. He litterally said that Burry was buying put options so his risk was limited:&gtMichael Burry is not SHORTING Tesla. Micheal Burry has purchased put options on Tesla. The downside of Put options are limited.
With Elon fan boys on one side and "he's just a crazy person" people on the other, I feel with me having neither Tesla stock nor Bitcoin, I'm on the rational side.I wonder if /r/investing will at one point go back to the "boring" just-buy-etfs-and-hold with the occasional quality dd post in between.
Michael Burry of ‚ÄòThe Big Short‚Äô reveals a $530 million bet against Teslahttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html
He'll either be up another 40% in a months time, or down 40% knowing how Tesla moves
The whole bitcoin adventure for Tesla kinda look like a pump and dump to make Elon Musk richer. I think he really hurt the Tesla company reputation by doing it.
he said in december that tesla was going to pull back. he was correct. again.
Tesla puts.Burry wants a 2nd movie
Reminder: The downside of shorting is UNLIMITED. If you short a company, *you may lose more money than you put in*.It is considerably riskier than longing, where the downside is limited.Michael Burry is not SHORTING Tesla. Micheal Burry has purchased **put options** on Tesla. The downside of Put options are limited.
Burry showing his massive fucking balls again, first rule of Tesla shorting is you don't announce that you've done it. I am praying for him
Michael Burry bought more than 800,000 Tesla put options contracts in the first quarter worth $534.4 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission - CNBC#TESLA 300 IS NOT A MEME
tesla sell off initiated
Tesla really looks like it wants to hit 420 again
I know some of you love tesla and some of you despise Elon, but if you think about the next 12 months for tsla....It's undoubtedly over valued, and a lot of the value comes from Elon, but he's damaging that every time he opens his mouth.On top of that they hardly made any money when you strip out corn earnings and regulatory credits, and now we have shortages, inflation, rising metals prices, and a weakening dollar, so when you have a product with 70Kg+ of copper alone, plus all the other metals, and metals are rising exponentially...What is that going to do to the cost of production of each car? They are already over priced, and they'll have to stick the price up to struggling consumers with rising unemployment and less earnings for businesses, and etc.So less demand and rising prices = what?A booming company and stock price, or a disaster??Burry gets it.
This whole sub is buying puts on tesla, which obviously means it‚Äôs time to buy calls right ü§°
Lean Elon was good for tesla but fat wario Elon is bad.
Tesla will now be accepting GameStop in store credits as a method of payment
With all the tesla/Elon hate i thought it might be a good inverse wsb play to buy calls. *it was not a good inverse wsb play*
Elon literally cares more about a monkey playing video games than he does about Tesla Motors.
Tesla to $100 by end of year
I hate Elon Musk and I hate Tesla and I can't wait for the day that overinflated piece of shit company becomes valued correctly. Same goes for these retarded fucking coins.
They made more $$$ than Tesla, offer buybacks AND dividends. Also the housing market is RED hot!
Hue hue hue pump Bitcoin lord TeslaNo not like that :&gt(
Michel Burry bought half billion worth of Tesla puts, I am selling my XLE calls and joining him.
Lol. Michael Burry has a Tesla put for almost 40% of his fund. Am I reading that right?
They could have sold all their bitcoin, had Musk say Tesla wasn't accepting it anymore, waited for the bottom of the crash, and bought all back in.
Because he lies, cheats and imparts chaos wherever he goes. He's the same as all the other wallstreet guys under it all. If i could invest in Elon without investing in Tesla, I would though, and thats the crux. He's a dickhead but he'll make you money.
Good morning contrarians!Stocks are down a bit in the pre-market with small-caps leading the drop. Russell 2000 is off 0.6%. Nasdaq, Dow and S&ampP down about 0.3% each. That‚Äôs as of 0610.The weekend news was all about the crypto sell off, driven by Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets. At the time of this recording, digital coins have recovered from their lows after Musk ‚Äòclarified‚Äô that Tesla had not sold any bitcoin. BTC is now trading at around 45k. It was as low as 42k and change.Friendly reminder that I don‚Äôt care about bitcoin or crypto and will discuss it only when I absolutely need to, like now. Quick interlude about cryptos‚Äô place in investing that I‚Äôm not going to type out. Listen to the audio.Last week was crazy volatile and investors are probably hoping for a bit more quiet this week. They may even get it, with not much on the economic data front and earnings season wrapping up. Whatever cash was generated from selling last week (and over the weekend) should find its way into some risk assets before long seeing how the risk free rate is still close to zero. The question is, which risk assets?No major economic data releases on the docket today. The NAHB Housing Market Index for May is out at 10. Not much going on with earnings today either. Walmart, Home Depot, and Macy‚Äôs report tomorrow.
True! And that's what I was referring to actually. Tesla may have sold the rest of their bitcoins between the filing and the "Indeed" tweet and then no sale between the "Indeed" and the "no sale" tweets.You can't tell.
What are some Tesla stocks?
Remember Tesla sold some to show it can be converted to cash for a balance sheet.That was at a peak. It dropped, he talked shit on it, it dropped more.Guaranteed they bought back in at this dip. That's several hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit.
Don‚Äôt get rekt shorting Tesla
What growth? The q4 and q1 car deliveries were very similar, if you consider regulatory credits many of which are expiring and sales of Bitcoin to be great drivers of growth for a car company I would like to hear how.Not only that but Tesla is having huge production issues barely making any Model S cars for example so future quarters are a bit up in the air too.  Maybe there is going to be huge growth but if you are looking at the last two quarters they aren‚Äôt showing it. Total profits from cars were only a few million last quarter, it looks like Tesla is going to sell its Bitcoin just so that next quarter will still look profitable, since it isn‚Äôt coming from the car sales.
Tesla green bc boomer investors think technoking has become more prudent
Still remember that time when Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla was overvalued and crashed his own stock lmao
Tesla sharting tomorrow
Now that all the retards are buying tesla puts, it will start mooning hard.
I'm gonna be the only one buying tesla calls tomorrow apparently lol
Twitter bros posting screenshots of Google "how to short Tesla". ü§°ü§°ü§°
I think A LOT of the weird things that have been happening with Tesla / Elon have to do with GM, Ford, and the rest of the worldwide auto brands move aggressively towards EV.  Tesla has a epic fuck ton to fear from the large automakers, since underneath all the hype Tesla actually produces a pretty shitty product plagued by logistic and QC issues....  Essentially, as the big automakers make there presence felt in the space Tesla will bleed&amp#x200BI'm probably wrong though
Tesla calls
Tesla investors bending themselves into all sorts of pretzels to excuse Elon‚Äôs behavior.‚ÄúRoBoTaXiS bY YeAr EnD‚Äù
As a Tesla call holder, Elon needs to fuck off of coin for a while
these salty Tesla retards are just mad that Elon is cucking their wives
TESLA TO 400 IS NOT A MEME
https://i.imgur.com/WaPxV8O.jpgPOV: You own tesla calls
I genuinely think Tesla is going to take a very hard dive tomorrow solely based on how angry a lot of people are at him, and the big cross over between those people and Tesla stock owners
He got mad because he said some really dumb stuff (like crypto 101 stuff) and Bitcoin maximalists (granted, generally a-holes) called him out.Elon having a large ego, couldn‚Äôt seem to be uninformed about a technical thing - so he doubled down. The unstoppable force of Elon‚Äôs ego came up against the immovable object that are Bitcoin acolytes (basically religious zealots).Honestly though (as a Tesla shareholder) I‚Äôm amazed elon dropped 1.5b on something he clearly doesn‚Äôt understand.
Elon shitt head I‚Äôm selling Tesla stocks I‚Äôm done with you.
If you ask the original founders if Elon is a founder, they are legally obligated to say yes because they sued him for calling himself a founder and then settled the suit.  The settlement deal was money in exchange for pretending Elon is a founder of Tesla.Elon's argument was that he invested more than anyone else by far.  It's not like he doesn't deserve a lot of credit but it's such a petty thing to do, insist that everyone think the idea was his or partly his when it just wasn't.
The tweet didn't, however, say that Tesla hadn't already sold everything. "Will not sell" is easy when you have nothing left.
Absolutely loving the Tesla hate üòÇComment below for an opportunity to receive an embarrassing reminder you bet against Tesla when it stunts on you in the next couple days.Alternatively I‚Äôll be back to apologize and beg you for bus fare ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
That's also not happening anytime soon, right now Biden plans to make sure American manufacturers have the edge for EV production and may reinstate the customer incentives for Tesla again.
Yeah right. The competition needs to build battery manufacturing plants far faster than Tesla is, and Tesla has 2 new plants opening up in the next year. After that they will begin producing their own batteries and continue building more factories.The current 50% YOY production growth Tesla has planned for every year this decade is already looking like they might hit 100% this year and one million EV's, meanwhile, Ford can barely make 50k mach E's a year.Will Tesla lose their 25% global BEV market share? Yes. Will competition surpass them in this race? That's highly unlikely because of battery limitations. VW is the only competitor with a plan to compete with Tesla right now.
He didn‚Äôt create anything‚Ä¶ he bought his way into tesla and wasn‚Äôt even an original founder. The dude is simply a piece of shit.
People complaining about Elon‚Äôs retarded tweets obviously haven‚Äôt been around for long. Literally 1 year ago the dude tweeted Tesla stock price was too high.
Perhaps he was just telling the truth. Tesla won't be selling any bitcoin, because they already sold them. It's a truthful statement even leaving out the last part.
A lot of Tesla haters right now üìà
Fraudsters and scammers know to break up assets into several different wallets.  Chances are, Tesla did the same for the sake of privacy.
To buy more for cheaper? I heard Tesla wouldn't have met projections without the profit from btc sales. Maybe they're doing the same thing again
Uhhh do we get tesla puts? Haha how is this algorithm working? Does it also count mentions of Elon?
So what about releasing a note to investors last week stating that "Tesla is not planning on selling any of their bitcoin" and then 5 days later selling their bitcoin. Is that not misleading investors?
Tesla thinks they're innovative. Who invented the fucking square burger patty?That's what I thought.
Tesla already knew how bitcoin worked when they invested 1.5 billion dollars in it. That's not the reason they sold now
The masses will turn on Tesla when the major car manufacturers are shitting out EVs left and right and Tesla is struggling to keep up.This will happen sooner rather than later.
Even as someone who holds some bitcoin I could not understand Tesla buying bitcoin while pushing their renewable strategy. I really think this is the simplest and logical explanation.
Some completely true facts about ElonHe got kicked out of a small website called x.com for being a dumbass. Peter Thiel then proceeded to turn it into the behemoth that is Paypal. He just happened to still hold stock as its value explodes. He did not found or build Paypal.TESLA WAS NOT FOUNDED BY ELON MUSK, it was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Elon bought a majority stake in tesla and then proceeded to kick them out of their own vision and masquerade as a savior to humanity.

Elon is a Snake Oil salesman, The Trump of Tech, manipulator of mindless millions. Who else invests $700 for every $1 Tesla makes?
Perhaps ü§îü§î my Tesla puts ü§îü§î aren't fuk ü§îü§î
This is a bit ridiculous. Tesla is doing well enough, and human activities will always pollute. It's a trade off from greenhouse gasses to other pollutants. Right now GHG is the biggest problem. Manufacturing and extraction pollutants can be cleaned up, mostly. Autopilot is safer than your average human driver. It's not going to be perfect yet, it's new tech.
I rented a Tesla once. Was fucking amazing. They can definitely make a car.
Judging by the tone of his statement, it sounds like some major investors basically told Elon to get out of BTC.How can you sell Tesla as a renewable company when Bitcoin burns so much fossil fuels?
If the market couldn‚Äôt track that Archegos owned and was then stopped out of a material percentage of a bunch of media and Chinese tech companies, I don‚Äôt think the market is going to be able to track the acquisition and disposition of a substantially less regulated asset (unless Tesla purposefully decided to be transparent about it).
TESLA TO 400 IS NOT A MEME
Tesla below $500 next week.
I'll be laughing when Tesla reports Q2 that they sold all their corns for big ass profits and the poors are holding his bags. What a fucking genius , and tons of corntards will be crying about manipulation when that happens.
Tesla will go up with all that coin money rolling back into high growth
Lately his views and opinions on crypto is absolutely shocking. He couldn't even hold BTC for more than 3 months without announcing that he doesn't wanna use it anymore. A straight pump and dump. Tesla won since they most likely sold for a profit. If he keeps doing this dumb market manipulation on twitter he should simply be banned from it smh.
I don't know whether Tesla has sold all its Bitcoins or not... but Musk is definitely trolling either way.
Tesla should be interesting tomorrow..
Look at these trades...Weren't they sweet...Wouldn't you think 1,000,000 would have made him completelooking around you would think... he had everythinghe could of just put it in the S&ampP 500he could of retired to the philipines and fucked hookers galoreYou want a tesla?... he could of bought 20but who cares...

The instability of Elon Muskrat is having its toll on Tesla rn. If we have another downtrend next week, rip call holders and retards who bought at 900.
Tesla Roadster
Dude i wish i was a girl so i can do twitch streams in bikinis and get donations from simps while i pretend i dont know exactly what i am doing. The next best thing is buying tesla fds though obviously.
We‚Äôre you shitting on him when Chinese companies went +500% compared to their US counterparts, or are you just using hindsight bias to poke fun at other people now that the market has corrected himself?Not disagreeing, just putting it into perspective üôÇAlways get a kick out of people laughing at Chinese stock multiples while continuing to pump Tesla.  üòÇ
In general, I‚Äôd say the options game has given me a toxic perception of money, which I‚Äôve been giving away way fucking easier than I can earn it. But, I have these lucid moments like I just had that almost make it worth it: the mechanic‚Äîvisibly uncomfortable‚Äîtold me I need my brakes replaced for $400, and I just said ‚Äúyes‚Äù before he could finish his explanation. $400? I blew more than that on 0dte Tesla options yesterday without blinking.
You think when Tesla began allowing BTC to purchase vehicles (VERY RECENTLY) they didn‚Äôt know of BTC energy use? Now all of a sudden it‚Äôs a surprise?You‚Äôve got to be kidding me, dude.
I tend to agree with you that tesla bears like to cherry pick things that support their case, but it actually does make sense to remove items that are unusual or extraordinary because they are by definition not part of the cure business. My two cents is take out regularity credits, take out the Bitcoin shit, normalize elons comp to something reasonable for a CEO, and that's about it. They'd probably still be profitable because of how ridiculous his comp is. But they are growing rapidly so you expect high amounts of R&ampD and capex.Any way you cut it, until fsd and more non-auto business lines ramp up, the company is over valued. It might stay that way forever too - the products are cool tech people are willing to pay for and the company mission is popular and it feels like a cool American success story to come out of nowhere and beat the establishment (both auto industry and wall street analysts).
yeah what the other guy said, BTC is not regulated... Dipshits like Elon pulling stunts like this that can literally shed 500 billion $ off a market in an hour after tweeting one thing, they are about to get a hardon for regulating this space  i just hope he gets in hot water over the Tesla implications of that tweet, Tesla stock started falling faster after the tweet and you can actually trace back the biggest dip to 1 minute after the tweet went live  im all for crypt-o getting endorsements and partnerships... but this guy just talks and talks with no filter, his company has not even started accepting another currency and all he does is talk about it non stop and the price swings as he does it, its not good for the space overall.. especially because the project he picked to endorse is literally a joke and was always intended to be one
Sell your Tesla shares and stock up on AMC just think how many you could buy.
so if i were tesla and lots of new EVS coming out, i'd proactively sink a ton of money into R and D to have a better product, no?
It's like all the naysayers never heard of earnings management or capex. If tesla kept R&ampD at nill and pocketed huge profits, I would be concerned about the sustainability of the firm whereas every critic in this thread would think it was a BUYBUYBUY.
well the options were A) sell some bitcoin and make easy profit b) report your actual pittance of an earning report without the additional 200m and watch your stock/net worth plummet  yes they did it just to "fix the earnings" .. otherwise tesla would probably be trading under 400 right now
Yeah, is Tesla the future of transportation or the future of currency manipulation?  LOL
Tesla itself is a whole pump and dump. Yeah they have great cars but so do all kinds of companies. That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs driving the stock, it‚Äôs the pump.
I don't see it as a smokescreen. It's just another part of the many reasons why Tesla is way overvalued
That's not something one of the most valuable companies in the world should be doing. Only a matter of time before the Tesla bubble pops
Focusing on anything as a percent of profits really distorts our view of the how the business works. A company doesn't make a bunch of money to cover costs and then makes a little more to be profitable. They make a bunch of money, and then we see if it covers costs or not.Tesla made $8.7 billion from their main business of selling cars (so, ignoring leases, energy, other services, etc.) Increasing or decreasing that by $100 million isn't really significant, it's around 1%, tiny changes in things like cost of raw materials will have a bigger effect than that.For most quarters, ignoring stuff like credits (and bitcoin this past quarter) Tesla would almost exactly break even. And then they make a small profit from these extraneous items. It seems pretty clear that they're trying to grow as quickly as possible while also controlling costs, and their goal ends up being right around a GAAP profit of 0 or small losses.In terms of cash generation they're doing a fantastic job and they're growing sales and revenues and margins extremely well. No company in their position should be holding back growth to try and squeak out a bigger profit every quarter.
&gt- Personal Transport (Robo taxi)Vaporware that is decades out from existing&gt- Solar Energy (Solar roof / Power wall)A product with no demand run by a company who sold installations on a fixed rate contract then went back to consumers with a 25% price increase, and now there's a class action lawsuit. &gt- SaaS with FSDVaporware that is decades out from existing&gt- Battery manufacturingLimited by supply constraints for their own product + underwritten by licensed technology from Panasonic.  &gt  Tesla literally shook all the car companies and is forcing them to innovate or be left behind.Yes, they did, they've absolutely changed the market.  And now the market is catching up, and Tesla is not keeping pace.
I was referring to revenue outside of car sales. The person I replied to was saying it's not fair to compare to other car manufacturers like Ford because Tesla makes money in other areas. My point wasn't that they don't sell cars, but that they don't have meaningful revenue growth **outside** of car sales. Should Tesla be valued as "not just a car company"? If so, where is the revenue growth outside of car sales?
And you don't think analysts were smart enough to take Bitcoin earnings into account to counteract this?Not to mention under newer accounting rules Tesla has to count all their gains or loses on Bitcoin regardless of if they sold or not. Bitcoins downward movement will hurt Tesla's earnings in future quarters because of that as long as they still have Bitcoin, and Elon said Tesla isn't selling the bitcoins they already have.
Wow, so Tesla failed to deliver one thing, robotaxis. Meanwhile, they built a factory in China in record time, launched the Model Y ahead of schedule, and are building two more factories in record time as well.Tesla has failed to deliver on other avenues for revenue growth?! They increased deliveries by 100% in Q1!
&gtMy feeling also. Credits make up a large portion of revenue and they will dry up once other manufacturers no longer need to buy them. Tesla currently makes money by not making cars, and that regulatory environment won't last forever.Actually, if you isolate the cars, Tesla had a profit of almost $2 billion just selling cars in Q1. Excluding credits.And credits are a direct result of producing cars. They won't go away any time soon.On the other hand, you have one-time expenses such as Musk's compensation plan and the expenses related to the S/X refresh. If you ignore those like you want to ignore recurring revenue, they are even more profitable.So you seem to be cherry-picking only what you need to, in order to make sure it fits you narrative.
&gtTesla is not a good company. It is a hype companyI keep hearing that, and yet it seems weird when they are actually delivering real growth.&gtand will start to really feel the effect once all the major car companies start pushing out EVs in 2023 and beyondIt's always some time in the future, isn't it? Yes, we've heard it all before.The problem is, by 2023, Tesla will be selling the $25k compact. And they will have their new and much cheaper and better batteries which everyone else won't be able to use. And they won't stand still in general. You seem to be assuming that Tesla will be  doing nothing and make it easy to catch up with them.
Yeah, retail investors should obviously be building Tesla factories instead. Morons!

Tesla is not an automotive company. It's a "whatever Musk says" company.He has 55M followers on twitter, he'd simply say some new amazing product is coming down the pipe with amazing margins and people will eat that up and pump the company to the 1 trillion level.Likewise Federal and State Government, every politician wants a shoutout from him on twitter. He can glue together Proof of Concept, then tweet about it claiming that it's the next big thing for humanity and watch market participants (both institutional and retail) pump the company to the moon, at the same time he can sit and watch the Federal and State Government handing him money in order to be part of this next big thing.
Really now? Then why does Panasonic make Tesla's batteries? Did you know that Tesla doesn't actually make their own batteries? I'm guessing no.
Tesla manufactures and sells electric cars. They are not in the business of buying and selling bitcoin.  They gave guidance for the quarter, saw they weren't going to make it, and sold BTC at a gain to prop up the bottom line.  It has nothing to do with their core operations or how efficiently those are run.  That is 100% earnings management.
And then you subtract the $200 million one-time expense related to the S/X refresh, and it would not have been a miss after all. And so on.And we can keep doing this forever. Just add or subtract random things until you get the desired result.Scott Galloway, by the way, is the guy who made a bunch of predictions about Tesla a while back. Every single prediction failed. Guess he's a bit salty now.
Wow, it just seems like people hate Tesla here. I am no fanboy, just trading the stock. No other automaker has touched them yet. Wait until that happens, then assess the situation. The OP post is okay as information, but that is about it. The rest of the emotional hate in this thread is pathetic.
This whole sub has gotten this weird logic lately: "If I remove every profitable piece of the business the business sucks!"Like if you remove Tesla &amp Bitcoin from Ark, or government environment initiatives from Tesla. Yea, no shit but they chose to capitalize on reality. That's literally what makes a good business. If you removed government liquidity the whole S&ampP would be gobsmacked right now.
There‚Äôs a difference of VW saying they made earnings because of one model and Tesla making earnings because of BTC, it doesn‚Äôt contribute to the fundaments of Tesla: EV. It‚Äôs not a financial institution segment share and it will most likely not happen every quarter. So for me that justifies the drop on earnings
Using anything but superchargers and home charging is a pretty shitty experience unless you have a free chargepoint or something at your work, and even then you're limited to work. Not only are the cars great (highest owner satisfaction) but the supercharger network is a HUGE deal. I couldn't stand tesla fanboys before I owned one.  My only regret is not buying tesla stock instead of my car. I coulda paid off my house and a car by now.
Tesla got a billion dollar handout to build a plant to manufacture solar panels in Buffalo and they can't produce anything because there is no demand. They promise the city jobs and can't deliver.https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/buffalo/news/2021/05/02/south-buffalo-tesla-plant-faces-backlash-for-hiring-effortsSolar panel manufacturing is not going well. Also Tesla does not run a utility.Elon also assured everyone that there will be over a million robotaxis on the roads by mid 2020 and we are not even close. Fully self driving cars are at least a decade away when you consider legal and regulatory issues they face. Do you think lawmakers in the US and abroad are going to let Teslas operate on public roads freely without a driver? How much legislation needs to be passed before the legality of that is defined. For example when a fully autonomous car hits and kills a pedestrian, who is liable? The car owner or Tesla? They won't allow robo-cars on the road until they can figure all that out and if you think that will be done in the next 5 years, I would say you are being overly optimistic.Tesla has has failed to deliver on their other avenues for revenue growth so until they can prove they can, I wouldn't be so optimistic on their prospects.
I know, the point is that tesla isn't 5 years ahead in tech.
I mean it's priced like it's the market leaderI understand sentiment can sometimes outvalue fundamentals, so as long as tesla is viewed as such I can see it being still valued highly even when the current downturn ends.
I think you're underestimating the potential of product velocity and innovation.  Every other car company moves at a snail's pace compared to Tesla.
I know that I am just a guy on the internet but this is my take:Tesla will become a mid sized US car manufacturer similar in size and function to Jaguar or Range Rover in the UK. Funny enough both of these brands are owned by the same company, Tata Motors. Tesla does have a brand that people like to buy into but they won't match the quantity of vehicles sold by Toyota, Honda, or VW for a couple reasons:1) Making that many cars takes a lot of ramp up time. This is obvious, cars are intrinsically difficult to make and source parts for and this takes time. 2) Doing this would destroy their brand. Right now Tesla is seen as a luxury or luxury-lite brand. If they produce too many cars a year they will lose that perception and have to compete on function with other (likely better) car manufacturers. Tesla's numbers are currently comparable to Jaguar and Range Rover. Both of those brands also have an exclusivity around them that if they sell to many vehicles by lowering prices and luxury amenities they will lose. Being Jaguar or Range Rover is not bad both companies do well especially in good markets where people are willing to buy their cars for the status symbol they are. Valuing Tesla higher than all other automotive companies combined is clearly unrealistic.
Cars from the VW group do pretty well, namely Audi.Also the charging infrastructure here is quite decent and not at all limited to only Tesla stuff. Speaking for Germany.I've got more than a dozen public chargers next to the curb spread out in my neighbourhood for instance.
Tesla, by design is trying to blitz the market. They are selling at super low costs despite being the best EV company. Imagine being Ford/GM and you have to have cut in dealers, pay legacy pension costs and outsourced EV tech because you don‚Äôt have it in house. Ohh you have to deal with unions while laying off ICE workers. Tesla has none of that. They will likely gain a larger share faster than anyone meaning they can be the low cost provider. Long term, the car will be peanuts, the value will be in subscriptions to self driving (which admittedly everyone still has to prove). Think iPhone and App Store.Not to mention Elon has said the solar/utility market is larger than autos. Ford has no exposure there
Imagine a "Premium" Tesla package only available if you buy with Bitcoin. Crazy enough to actually work
Tesla isn't worth it's market value. It pisses me off that it is so large it is now a big component of major indexes. So pretty much everyone invested in the stock market has  exposure to this hype company trading at 600 p/e.
My feeling also. Credits make up a large portion of revenue and they will dry up once other manufacturers no longer need to buy them. Tesla currently makes money by *not* making cars, and that regulatory environment won't last forever.
I wouldn‚Äôt say Tesla is a bad company, it‚Äôs just wildly overpriced at the moment.
Game stop is not anything like Volkswagen, and is not shit compared to Tesla. It‚Äôs not gonna break 1k, in fact it‚Äôs gonna be at 0 in less than 5 years because game stop is like block buster all over again, outdated and being replaced. Microsoft and Play station will cut out the middle man to make more, just wait for it ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. Tesla and VW are about 200 and 167 times more valuable than game stop.
Selling all my Tesla at open guys, so Tesla can moon for the rest of the day, thank me later
Tesla
BREAKING:  Elon will now accept gourd futures for a Tesla.
I'm not buying tesla until I see rednecks hoarding AA batteries in plastic bags thinking they're going to profit off of electric cars.
Tesla stock sets new record for biggest drop in a week for any production car company üò≠üò≠
Tesla now accepts lumber ü™µ as payment for Tesla vehicles
Yeah with the recent gas nonsense I dont think think Tesla is going anywhere.
buyers of digital ponzi mad at Elon and Tesla right now lol
I wouldn't speculate on a PT, so hard to say, but I do think this latest tweet was a very calculated move and in no way has Elon Musk "lost it" I think he knows exactly what he is doing, and that is fighting for the lead position in the Renewable Energy Market. This move is a preemptive PR move against other companies looking to challenge TSLA in this arena. [https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/exclusive-tesla-seeks-entry-into-us-renewable-fuel-credit-market-sources-2021-05-12/](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/exclusive-tesla-seeks-entry-into-us-renewable-fuel-credit-market-sources-2021-05-12/)
This is WallStreetbets not wallstreet $13 stock hold for 20 years. Tesla volatility is good for us old timers here
did tesla just became a joke?
I'm using Stash. You can buy fractional shares of stocks and funds. Once or twice a week they have a "Stash Stock Party" and if you go there and hit the button, they give you a tiny slice of some stock. It's not much, under a buck, but it's a savings account that easily beats the interest rate at any bank. I've got small slices of all kinds of stock that way - Apple, Tesla, Etsy, etc., and it was all free.
100% agree with you. Tesla has been fortunate to be left alone in EV until now, but the gig is up and the other manufacturers are set to make big splashes.
Seriously. This guy rage-sells his Tesla shares and does a little write up about nothing, I say inverse whatever he says
Tesla did not back out of their magic coin position, they only removed the ability to accept payment via magic coin.
Hold Tesla. Elon is a once in a generation con man and there is no shortage of fanboys ready to get cucked.
Tesla seems to be hype stock. I see it as way overbought and once traditional manufactures increase ev market share tesla sell rates will take a massive dip. There only solid market is america. Europe will become dominated with the likes of audi , bmw and vw. There build quailty is 10x tesla and there tech will be soon aswell.
Buying a Tesla this week. Love the STONK.
 I normally agree.... but now you‚Äôre on here saying Tesla will rise..... I‚Äôm so conflicted, now I‚Äôm unsure what to do üòÖ
Same - always do the opposite of WSB posts. Glad to see that Tesla will rise again.I like that stock aswell
You're late, but not too late and not wrong. My puts have been printing. TSLA sentiment value is linked to Musk's tweets and that's not a safe thing to bet on. Quality control issues, production numbers, and labor issues are also all against Tesla where their early penetration of the EV market is not going to hold against big auto makers in the longterm.Test drive a Model Y and then a Mustang Mach-E if you really think Tesla has any unique selling point in the EV market. If you're looking at EV shipping/trucking, the Amazon fleet powered by Rivian and that company's expansion might be a better bet. If you aren't accredited to invest in Rivian, you can still invest in a company that has a stake in them.
Apple prints money now. It remains to be seen if Tesla will ever come close to that level of profitability.
I mean, Tesla was a very wild ride. When I looked into Tesla it was sitting at 180‚Ç¨ and then catapulted up to 800‚Ç¨. That alone was a huuuuuuge jump. Everyone was yelling sell, but that crazy stock continued to rise. Earlier this month it was sitting at 600‚Ç¨, that's like 3k in before split price. Just think about that... Some people called it overvalued at 180‚Ç¨ and it jumps up to 800‚Ç¨ and then continues all the way up to about 4000‚Ç¨. Has there been another stock with movements similar to this one?
YOLO TESLA lets goooo
Tesla calls. Got it.
Tesla will change the world one day but along the way there will be ups and downs. But im also a retard who bought syphilis coin
Selling Tesla in the 800‚Äôs to get in on the original GME squeeze is starting to make me look less retarded
Feels weird though. I don‚Äôt hate Tesla I just felt like they were going down.
If you go back to the 1 month chart for Tesla, that‚Äôs when I bought 100 shares @760 and sold the 770 covered call thinking it would be an easy exercise and an easy 4k.... 1 month later I‚Äôm down 20k. Just call me king clown ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
Can't wait to be on mushrooms playing Roblox in my Tesla with a shitty GameStop brand controller all of which was bought with a defunct currency
Idk. Elon Musk has been sus recently. His company put out great numbers for Q1 but it was found out it was largely due to bitcoin sales. Then he was criticized for selling bitcoin after pumping it up, to which he replied "oh the company just sold some of its shares but its a long term holder in bitcoin"And then a couple of days ago just announced tesla is not accepting bitcoin as payment........so idk im sure you can do basic math, that doesnt scream trustworthy to me
He bought Tesla and made them list him as a co-founder. I think it's good for the world that he made electric cars economically viable a few years earlier than they would have been otherwise but he's clearly an egotistical brat.
That video seems to be full of straw men and willfully misleading arguments. For example, "debunking" that Tesla made the first EVs, which no one ever claimed.How can someone be taken seriously when they use dishonest arguments like that?When the arguments are false, the conclusion fails.
We‚Äôre all shorting Tesla right? Fuck Elon
Here's what made electric cars accessible to rich people who live in places with sufficient infrastructure to support them1. The invention of the lithium-ion battery2. The depletion of oil reserves.That's it.  There were electric taxis a century ago, there were electric dustcarts in the '60s, and milk has been delivered by EV since the early '30s.  There is absolutely nothing revolutionary about Tesla (which Musk did not start himself), they're just putting already mature technologies together and marketing them in a way that suggests Musk invented them, just like some Apple fans think Steve Jobs invented the smartphone.However, electric cars are not accessible to most of the world.  They are either too expensive to buy, there aren't enough charging locations, or people can't afford to live somewhere where they can actually park their car in their own garage and charge it overnight.
Little does that lady know that gasoline chews through plastic like same expiry day OTM calls eats through the bank accounts of tesla traders
&gt This was all a marketing and PR scheme.It was a pump and dump dressed up as PR and marketing.Tesla bought a pile of cryptocurrency. Musk tweeted about the same currency. Tesla then announced they were accepting it for payments.I'd be curious to see the companies holding in it right now.
If they really changed their minds because they found out about the carbon footprint of Bitcoin after their initial acceptance and purchase, then they must be one of the most incompetent companies in the world. A 2 minute search on the cons of Bitcoin would have revealed this. I hesitate to invest in a company that is run by people who are unable or unwilling to do the most basic research. Sadly... I'm indirectly invested in Tesla from ETFs...
Exactly, and he needs to find other sources if income to obfuscate the fact that Tesla does not make any money selling cars. Almost all revenue comes from selling emission credits.
It is unlikely that Tesla/musk just "changed thier mind." Massive energy consumption has always been a knock on Bitcoin. This is not new information, it has been well known for years.This is sleazy because their story makes no sense, is transparently illogical. Maybe they did legit change thier mind, but if so it was not based on old information like energy use.
Question I'm in the process of buying a new car (hence new car loan) within the next 45 days (depends on when Tesla calls me). A few days back my employer notified us that their system was hacked and my SSN has been leaked. How do I approach this?
Elon tweets this a few weeks after profiting $100M from BTC saying Tesla was accepting BTC payments for their cars and selling them when people were throwing their money on it. He cashed out before everyone then makes this tweet crashing the price...    Same with dogecoin. Tweeted everyday about it.Incited millions of his minions to throw their lifesavings into it. Announced he would shill it on SNL. The price crashed deeply during and after the show.    Also a history of Tesla stock manipulations.    All a bunch of pumps and dumps hurting the average investor while he stuff his bags heavy. Typical slimy two face dirtbag billionaire.    How you guys think he got to be where he is? By being nice and considerate to people?    Elon is the Trump of the tech world and his cult are as dumb and easily gullible as the magats. ''Elon is a genius, billionaire, relatable, good guy who works very hard 60+hrs/week to make humanity better!...''    See the resemblance with Trump?    Hope the SEC sues his ass and put him in jail just like they did to John McAfee for shilling shitcoins in 2017-2018.
shorting tesla
Everyone get puts on Tesla tmrw
I had puts up huge last time Tesla dropped to $500. Guess what happened next? It jumped right back up to $700. Never bet against musk
I dont think very many people buy a Tesla with a credit card
Elon is looking more and more unstable by the day. Burry was right. TESLA and ARK are going to crash
Most if not all billionaires are minted directly or indirectly through some sort of public funded projects.Tesla has Electric Vehicle Tax Credits in the US(and other govts provide even more, look at Norway)Spacex was famously saved by NASA contracts when they were running out of money.These are just a couple of the numerous examples.
Soooo... #Calls on Tesla ?
Tesla is becoming more like a publically traded hedge fund than it is a car company. He's the portfolio manager, head trader, etc.
Tesla drops Internet payment support because of environmental concerns.. lmao.. more like valuation concerns ü§£
Investigated by who ?  Cryptocurrency is owned by no one remember?  It‚Äôs not under the SEC because it‚Äôs supposed to be a currency ‚Äúoutside of governments and banks‚Äù .  It‚Äôs not regulated .  It‚Äôs made up by people as a form of barter.  His statement said he is not selling any of it just Tesla is no longer taking it as a form of currency .  Really ask yourself have you ever used it as currency and would you or are you looking at it as a form of investment like gold (a shiny rock in my opinion).   The point of crypto is to get away from fiat currency but everyone is pretty pissed that‚Äôs it‚Äôs value in fiat went down . One Bitcoin is still one Bitcoin so what‚Äôs the problem ?
Either Tesla collapses this week. Or everyone sees what Tesla bears have been seeing.The rampant gamma squeeze manipulation that has occurred with options juicing the stock price. This technique is known as Hwang sauce, popularized by bill Hwang.Fun fact, bill Hwang provided seed money to cathie wood of ARK, the biggest Tesla bull. Funner fact, Tesla had been plummeting since bill Hwang got margin called.If you thought GameStop was a fun story of market manipulation by citadel, wait until this plays out against Elon.The autismo king has no clothes
I could be overreacting but if we get a market crash, It‚Äôs a huge opportunity to make a ton of money. Puts on the way down, then buy apple, Amazon. Microsoft and Tesla at the bottom
No one is going to pay in bitcoin anyway. The terms of buying a Tesla dictate that if you return the car they get to choose to repay you in US dollars or Bitcoin.Meaning that if the price of bitcoin goes down, they will give you bitcoin back. If it goes up, then they will give you US dollars back.That's a huge risk. No one would do that. It is smarter to just sell your bitcoin for cash and then buy the car with cash.This was all a marketing and PR scheme.
Wow, Elon Musk just announced that Tesla will no longer be taking a very special type of virtual currency anymore because it is bad for the environment.  I wonder if he dumped all of his holdings in said currency before announcing this.  That'd be straight up manipulation.
Am I going to short Tesla tomorrow? :(
This just in, Tesla will now accept GameStop stock for purchases. Really wouldn‚Äôt surprise me.
Just need Elon to tweet that Tesla will begin accepting shares of PLTR as payment for cars.
Time to short tesla
An organization doesn't drop one billion dollars on an asset without months of deliberationMusk's conveniently timed tweets are almost certainly designed to make it cheaper for Tesla to buy in.&gtStill can't prove there's price manipulation though in the court of lawIts irrelevant because the SEC doesn't regular crypto anyway.
&gt Pumped and dumped.Didn't Tesla just lower the value of their bitcoin by more than they've sold off for profit?
I‚Äôm keying the next Tesla I walk by
Wonder if Elon actually does anything at Tesla. You know? Like, probably not, probably fucking not lol
Early January: Musk rags on bitcoin, dropping the priceTwo weeks later: Musks adds the btc logo to his twitter bio and reverses his stance on the coin and the currency pumps. Tesla reveals it bought $1 billion btc.Really makes you thinkNot to mention the amount of times he's tried to pump shibe coin
How are people actually buying this bullshit statement? Do you actually believe Elon/Tesla are just now finding out about hoe much energy BTC uses????
Mods if Tesla ends tomorrow over 620 flair me as Professional Retard
Hmm. Surely Tesla will not start using DogeCoin? No he would never try and manipulate something like that
It gets talked about in just about every thread where EVs and batteries are the subject.  EVs are a \*necessary\* evolution to a sustainable transportation industry. Full stop. Nobody said it's the \*only\* step, just that it is necessary. There is no debate about our energy grid as a whole being sustainable today, it's not. We know it's not. When it is, everything that uses it (EVs included) will be more sustainable. Tesla intends to recycle all lithium batteries in vehicles today and the plan (we'll see if they can do it, but there's a plan) is to eventually be fully sustained by recycled batteries.  To phrase it another way, EVs are moving a decentralized problem (All gas vehicles emitting climate warming pollution) to a few more centralized, solvable problems (Energy grid and supply chain).
&gtTesla will not be selling any Bitcoin Where's the dump part?
&gtTesla will not be selling any BitcoinThey already sold some in Q1, booking over $100 million of profits because of it. It is in their 10Q.
Okay? But he's not manipulating Tesla. He's manipulating an asset Tesla holds, but not Tesla directly.He's not violating any laws unless he told people to short Tesla before announcing this.
Yeah, that's how I also understood "Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin"
Read: barely anybody was using their Bitcoin to buy Tesla, and dealing with the transactions we had was a pain in the ass.
&gt It looks like they sold all of it now,does it? ...&gt Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin
Tesla has confirmed they will be now accepting McDonald‚Äôs happy meal toys as forms of payment
As someone that regularly comes in here to argue in crypto's favor, this is a huge deal that can't really be understated.  Though I think it would have gone higher anyways, Elon helped pump BTC from 34K-64K with the Tesla news.  He's one of the most influential people in the world and this will spark conversations for weeks on this.ETH is already halfway to BTC's market cap.  This could legitimately lead to the "flippening" ETH folks have been wanting for so long.  Why?  Because ETH is moving to PoS (Proof of Stake) which uses far, far less energy than Bitcoin's PoW (Proof of Work), which is the respective ways the networks achieve security and decentralization.
Elon killed corn so he can announce buying Tesla with dogs which are more energy efficient. 1 Tesla = 24,000 golden retrievers
I'm sorry but the guy is just a fucking clown to me. Tesla is barely profitable if it all. During probably the most delicate time of Tesla's development he starts all that dumb 420 bullshit, opens the company up to SEC fines. Later while the stock is suffering after massive growth and trying to stay afloat he piles into bitcoin and then starts shit talking the asset on twitter. Now all of a sudden when growth stocks get raped and crypto goes with it, he's a champion for fossil fuels cutbacks. Give me a fucking break. I mean I will agree that our current financial system handles trillions of more transactions globally and probably more efficient than BTC ever could but to type that bull shit into a statement is just ridiculous to me. Were talking about a guy who wants to transfer the entirety of the US vehicle fleet onto the electrical grid who NEWS FLASH is 40% natural gas and 20% coal currently.It's a yikes from me.
Maybe because no one is actually using it to buy Tesla?
Tesla 400 eow
I mean surely Musk knew about the energy requirements when Tesla began accepting Bitcoin?
Hey lookTesla has a P/E under 600 now ü§°
Tesla just made me homeless
I‚Äôm officially all in on spy and Tesla calls now. If this isn‚Äôt the bottom it will be the third time I‚Äôve successfully blew up my account
National debt at all time high, up 25%+ in 12 months, money supply up almost 500% in 12 months, jobs numbers rubbish, unemployment higher, inflation is 4.2% (yeah, right), so how does a dog turd like Tesla stay above 600 with a P/E of over 600, and why is gold going down?I'm not saying the market is rigged, corrupt, and fraudulent, but the market is rigged, corrupt, and fraudulent.
I mean it‚Äôs disingenuous to not point out you would have underperforming for 14 years.I also think it‚Äôs kind of alarming that she only really outperforms the s and p 500 for hitting on Bitcoin and Tesla. 2 positions carrying your career is not sustainable and does not make a great fund manager. I have a hard time believing she‚Äôll find the next Bitcoin or Tesla.
If she needed to take out a $25k loan to invest in Tesla it wasn‚Äôt insider trading.
How do you know she's wrong about Tesla's future market position? You can't know that, unless you're a time traveler.As it stands, she sees potential enough to bid Tesla up to it's current price, and the market agrees with her. In any meaningful sense - she has been proven right about Tesla. Ignoring this reality is deliberate ignorance.
I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs right about Tesla, but they got to the price she predicted.
Right. She‚Äôs had a strat for years that just hit big in one particular year. Tesla in particular, she‚Äôs been a huge fan and buyer for years and turned out she was right all along. She has gone for it for years but 2020 in particular the market decided to go where she thought it would go. She‚Äôs just as right as if Tesla averaged that growth over 5 years rather than one. Being right is right.
Hello üêª Tesla investor since 2010 here.Please point out in your FUD spewing that \- your mention of large positions of $1 puts is not unusual for TSLA, happens all the time \- your mention of the $1 puts is out of context, the $1 put position is for 6/18, not this weeks expiry\- ü¶ç's google negative gamma squeeze ü§™
I don‚Äôt treat Tesla as a car maker. Otherwise it would be $50 max. It‚Äôs the future of energy and wall street is treating it this way. Between batteries, million miles story , rooftops etc, etc. more exciting is the amount of data collection they have for self driving cars, gas or electric. No company in the world has their data and they can leverage that over their sales. Options with Tesla is dumb. I lost money and made some too. The key is the stock itself. Only time will tell but I am buying the stock.
The crash isn‚Äôt coming yet. I think the market bottomed out today and I went all in on Tesla and spy calls. Tesla 655c 5/14 and spy 420c 5/28. Let‚Äôs take papa into the  6 digits on my options account
Yeah gas going up 5 cents for a week definitely gonna make people drop 40K on a new Tesla
They were the biggest institutional holders of Tesla, up until they sold post split. They don't fuck around when it comes to Tech/growth stocks.
I would suck on cathie woods titties if that meant Tesla hit 700 tomorrow
I worked as a loan officer a few years ago (2014-2018) and someone took out a $25,000 loan to invest in Tesla. She said something like, ‚ÄúI heard it‚Äôs going to skyrocket.‚Äù Can‚Äôt remember what she bought in for. Wonder if it was insider trading. Wonder if she‚Äôs still invested. Wish I had invested too!
Your entitled to your opinion, as am i. What i don't understand is why a majority of the people on Reddit have to be insulting and negative. Do you feel better about yourself and your investment now?I hope you are right a out Tesla splitting again, because i still have more. In the meantime im going to Hawaii for a couple weeks thanks to my profitable investment's
The true yolo is people like me who bought Tesla puts a couple of months ago.
Tesla and pltr is immortal, bitch. Kathie sacrificed 50 of her employees to the fucking devil to keep tesla at 600+.
I swear to gawd it sometimes seems like reddit doesn't have anyone actually in business, a currency that shifts like crypto does isn't a currency at all and is functionally useless at the consumer/point of sale level. Like my company has consultations that can take an hour or so, we're not going to accept a set coin number that could swing a wild number in that hour let alone over a day, a coin that could go from taking care of payroll one day and providing a service at a loss the very next. It's great Tesla and a few others are OK with that risk, but I guarantee the vast majority of business is not.And if the solution to that is pegging how much BTC you accept to the dollar, then why not just use all the systems already in place for the dollar? It's pie in the sky thinking. A crypto that actually acts like a currency has to be invented and as long as crypto in general is used as a speculative investment tool it will be an uphill battle.
Surely Tesla buying bitcoin was the most obvious top in history.
Holy shit Tesla Elon‚Äôs going to be the 527th richest person by open
Tesla - 10% day incoming.Having your CEO announce he has assbergers is rarely good for a stock.
In January I was thinking of buying a Rolex and a Tesla.  Now I try to save on groceries.
so what your saying is buy Tesla @620 OK got it üòÑ
My ark, my tesla, my gme, my amc, my weed stocks, my clean energy, my digital casinos. dam the commodities.
They dont understand it yet for years tesla was 50 bucks this is the way.....
Damnit man I quit my McDo job in January after my Tesla tendies and now I‚Äôm going to have to apply again after this week FUCK
As soon as you short Tesla will buy the US government.
You know what they say, a tesla bear and his money are soon parted.
LMAO people still believe in Tesla robo taxis
Tesla was a 5 year hold for me, and look how that turned out.Not necessarily saying pltr is good though because it is being diluted to infinity by the time it'll be worth anything.
Makes me feel bad for the ppl who are already in Tesla but I dont have a position in yet so Im happy. Come payday Im going in nuts deep, and by that I mean maybe 3 shares
The year is 2030. Coca cola stock trades at 500 a share. McDonalds at 1,000. Citibank and Chase have grown so large that manhattan has been renamed "citibank city". Warren buffet sits down, in his elbow padded blazer, sipping on another coke and big mac from McDonalds. he's got a lot of spunk for someone is his age still, as he slowly makes his way out of his old trusty gas powered Lincoln continental. he says "those young whippernsappers, up in their clean energy and innovation stock shenanigans again, just like they did back in 2021/2020. but the boomers ALWAYS WIN. we ALWAYS win". he goes back into his mansion, dropping McDonalds fries along the way on the ground, in a meeting with citadel CEO. "who lives in there?" asks ken griffen? "oh, thats cathy wood, she rents out my boathouse now, got caught up in the ole disruptive innovation scam, ARKK holdings dropped 99.999% to 0.15 cents a share". they look in the distance and snicker, slurping their cokes and slamming down more big macs. as the camera rises away you see a dense smog over the horizon, and new oil fields propping up. to right, you barely make out a giant landfill heap that says "EV vehicle recycling" - where you faintly make out the TESLA gigafactory sign on the top of the trash heap, and hundreds of coca cola trucks exiting the facility, recycling the defunct EV cars into the next coke cans.
So Elon admits he's legit autistic and Tesla goes down
Apple, Tesla, Draft Kings, my butthole simply cannot handle another stellar earnings report.
One is over a 2 year period chart (apple) Other one is over a few month (tesla). Nice try OP. Try again. You can make anything look like anything if you try hard enough....
First to market offers a significant advantage. The ‚Äúbig‚Äù guys are behind and likely hold the mentality that once everything opens back up they‚Äôll be golden.It‚Äôs certainly a gamble but there are plenty of instances where the big guys stick to what they known and slowly die out. Aka I don‚Äôt care that GM is building an EV my Tesla is currently leaps and bounds ahead of it.
Tesla is a battery company pretending to be a car company. Their cars are subpar for the price, and under-engineered for the duty life we have come to expect from internal combustion engines, with nearly 0 aftermarket OE supply chain which is going to make owning a used out of warranty tesla a nightmare. But, I think the real secret is possibly TSLA becoming the amazon of energy. A vertically integrated ecosystem for renewable energy consumption. If they ever figure out the residential solar tech and integrate homes with their power wall Tesla will position itself more like Apple which streamlines the experience within the ecosystem. I think the future of energy utilities is decentralized power. Everyone will have battery arrays in their home and they will either soak up generated power from their home solar, or top off intelligently during off peak periods. Then during peak power grid draw times the batteries will siphon back into the system up to the personally allotted amount and help reduce the generation demands to smooth out the curve. Probably end up seeing this incentivized through tax credits and energy bill deductions in the future. I think eventually these types of decentralized home battery systems will replace the megapack and suit a similar purpose. That being said, I don‚Äôt own any tsla and won‚Äôt be buying at this price.
Yeah, driverless tech will get commoditized and the race to the bottom will continue. In fact, I think the automakers themselves are the ones best positioned to profit from robo-taxi fleets. Surely it will be cheaper for Ford and Tesla to build their own garages and deploy their own fleets than it will for any middleman to do so. All they have to offer is 'YOUR FIRST FIVE RIDES FREE!' and everyone will download their apps.Maybe Uber and Lyft can whitelabel and resell their platforms.
The problem is Tesla are making sweet f'all profit on their car sales, sooner rather than later tsla shareholders are going to realise that tesla is operating in a cyclical low margin highly competitive sector and then they are going to bail, you are completely correct tsla will be quite a bit under a 100pe next year (and quite likely this year) but not through the virtue of better earnings per share
It's crazier than that.  At their peak Tesla was valued as much as every major automaker combined.
Calm down there ole timer. If you live for another 10 years. You‚Äôll get a Elon Musk Tesla spaceX neurolink brain chip that‚Äôll make you 10x more productive and cure blindness, paralysis, dementia, telepathy. On second thought the cocaine ain‚Äôt a bad choice.
I mean, I was diagnosed with a mental illness and the medication absolutely helps me. I've done some psycho's in the past and they are definitely eye-opening experiences, but what if the patient has a bad trip? Do they need support after taking the drug?What if things go wrong? Just like a death in a Tesla car, will this drug receive bad press if it does impact a few people negatively? These are the questions I have regarding biotech in general. I am excited to see how this drug and PTSD treatment performs over time. There's so much evidence that it helps, but I think as anyone who wants to invest in a company like this should be cautiously optimistic.Instead of investing in companies like this, I personally invest in the distributors like CVS. I don't try to hit home runs on new medicine - I just try to find something stable to hedge my bets. Hope everyone invests safely!
Tesla is going to be under 100 p/e next year at current prices.Are you stupid enough to believe that a multi ten billion revenue company growing at 30-50% per year is overvalued at &lt100 p/e? As a comparison, Amazon was &gt1000 p/e something like 8 years ago at a tiny fraction their current market cap.
PLTR + TESLA = I m a bagholder + Bunkrupt = FUCKING DEAD !!!!
hm yeah that‚Äôs a good point, Tesla is even more overpriced. Good catch.Lots more room to fall.
You must have missed the memo on the cult of Tesla.
Boyyyy im bout to lose so much money on tesla weeklies and palantir leaps
Nothing Tesla has is "new" on a whole other level from some other manufacturers, it is indeed much like having better software or hardware.It's not like nobody else has functioning batteries, electrical engines, autonomous technology. And Tesla did not invent EV or the lithium battery etc.
Apple was a penny-stock and Tesla is a mega cap company, but lets try to find a date where their charts match and say they are comparable.
If Tesla tanks this much I'm going all in on futures
This was so cute. Now yolo your dads account on spy and Tesla calls
As you scroll through her Facebook feed and see her Tesla and smiling husband with obnoxiously great hair, you feel regret for a rare moment in your monstrously myopic life.This woman loved you, was willing to sign up to fight against the universe with you, but...you thought you could do a little bit better. You even said that to her, ‚ÄúI think I can do a bit better.‚Äù You were confused by her tears.Now, as you sit in your mom‚Äôs mildewed basement, living off the bologna sandwiches you can afford with Theta Gang gains, you realize you made a mistake. You run your hand through your obnoxiously thin hair as you start to cry. Tears, that if she could see them, wouldn‚Äôt confuse her at all.You bought puts on someone who limited up.Enjoy your bologna.
The only reason I don‚Äôt invest in TSLA is purely because of the power Elon musk has over the stock. If he decided one day he was spending too much time with Tesla and withdraw from the CEO position to focus on spacex the stock would plummet. He has way too much of an influence and I love the guy! üöÄüöÄü¶ç

The EV market has top and entry level luxury stuff. We need the Corolla of EVs at a Corolla price. We need them to support fast charging and we need more chargers everywhere. The first company that cracks the code will rocket past Tesla. Legacy has the footprint for mass building and customer service to do this. But I think Tesla will beat everyone else to the punch, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Theoretically, if he does take any of his other companies public, isn't that bad for Tesla? The invest in Elon crowd money could be split between two stocks instead of consolidated in one?
Also, the monopoly they will have on Mars when they become the first automaker to open a factory on the colony there. I think that was in Cathie's ARK prediction for Tesla, if I remember correctly.
That's all nice and cool, but they're not making any profit. Last quarter they stuffed the books with digicorn and carbon credits. They would be in red without digicorn.  Meanwhile, Stellantis is stopping purchasing Tesla carbon credits, which is 50% of Tesla credit revenue. All other manufacturers will slowly do the same, as they ramp up EV production.  The competition is heating up as well, if there was no semiconductor shortage, the new e-mustang would eat into Tesla sales much more than it did. Same with other manufacturers.  Market share in EU will go down as well, since Euro buyers prefer quality cars (remember, VW in US is not the same as in EU).   Tesla factory in Berlin will be a fucking disaster, mark my words. It's already behind schedule and now there's even a probe into them shitting on DE labor law.  Let's not even start about China, where the local competition is heating up as well (WSB favourite NIO) and will always get more govt fleet contracts, etc. Also, China loves luxury and they'll gobble up all EV Macans and German brands rather than Tesla.  Anyway, I love Tesla since I make little money shorting it every day as it melts down to $650.
Yeah but it is a certainty that Warren an Charlie are leaving a good guy on the steering wheel, regarding tesla idk
A few things to consider:If you truly believe Tesla is 10 years ahead of the competition and take that as fact to justify the current stock value, and a future value of $1.2 Trillion, you are in for a rude awakening.EVERYTHING has to go perfectly for Tesla over the next ten years to justify today's stock price and projected future price. A huge assumption in the future price of Tesla stock is their success in volume production of the 4860 Battery. This is completely unproven technology.  No one has ever mass produced such a cell. Building a factory to produce this is far easier than actually developing the trade secrets and proprietary techniques to successfully produce these.  How much experience and expertise does Tesla have manufacturing batteries? ZERO Years. Zero experience. They are not 10 years ahead here.  If anything, they are several years behind the state of the art. Tesla is a great company, and they have lots of super talented employees, but in making predictions about future stock valuations it is a good idea to be aware of the risk factors.  This is something that few sky high predictors of stock price seem to want to consider in any way.
If it‚Äôs Tesla vs. VW. 100% Tesla will win. VW has a terrible history when it comes to being environmentally friendly. They don‚Äôt care, they‚Äôre just in it for an easy buck, in my mind there‚Äôs no possible way VW could ever be a better choice than Tesla.
What happens if Elon steps down as CEO? Or god forbid he dies, would Tesla stock price crash?
Why you on a second Tesla? Shouldn't it last u at least 15 years like a good japanese car?
This is an easy Tesla. What‚Äôs VW going to do that will double their business?
Don't know what you're talking about with sales figures. VW sold less EV than half of Tesla last year, and that's including PHEVs. Meanwhile Tesla has already booked it's entire Q2 output this year and can comfortably increase prices, which it has 3 times recently.
They have surpassed Tesla in terms of evs sold, they have economics of scale at its finest and are able to compete already in European markets. Difficult times for Tesla.
What‚Äòs more likely: Tesla doubling from a 650bn market cap or VW from 120bn?

Elon ‚Äúwe will coup whomever we want, deal with it‚Äù Musk fled South Africa because he didn‚Äôt want to be drafted into their apartheid army, a reasonable move.

I don't think you need to question it. What she does is what she always did and it works, but now everyone - or at least a shitton more than ever before - look at what she does due to the 2020 increase.Out of the S&ampP 500 increase each year there are many between 0 and half of the total increase. The rest is hugely offset by smaller companies that had a huge increase of 50-500% in that year. On a total scale that doesn't mean a lot since their market cap is still small usually compared to the big players (aside from Tesla), but the point is the main increase doesn't come from the big ones.She has always bought everything not considered a big player yet that might grow in the future, or pure growth stocks. If the economy is normal the gains on the companies will be better than the S&ampP 500, if the economy is positively abnormal this will catapult gains into the sky, but if the economy is weak or bad, then this can mean YOY losses. Since February we have been in rougher times/a huge correction for growth stocks, meaning now it looks bad. But unless her ARKG drops down to 33% value compared to the start of the year, which would mean 30$, she is still up. Every period will have its own winners.
I think the companies listed here are solid and have the potential to impact the world. However, I would note that price/valuation are also very important when constructing a stock portfolio and should be taken into consideration. For example, I think everyone can agree that Tesla has done a lot to change the world and has made a real impact...but I don‚Äôt think everyone would want to own Tesla at current levels given current valuation and all-time high multiples
The volatility from Thursday and Friday were insane. I got some screen shots of the numbers and they were insanely higher than Tesla or any other stock on the market those two or three days. Hopefully earnings doesn‚Äôt make it go any lower. I bought in heavily the past week on the drops
You‚Äôre missing the fact that Vanguard and this week Blackrock and Bailee Gifford (Tesla mega bulls) all bought in at a mid $8 price point. I don‚Äôt wonder why.
I think Cohens plan is great, but I‚Äôm still not convinced the current price is reflective of the actual value of the company. That said, we‚Äôve said the same thing about Tesla for years only to watch it continue to grow...
But back in 2000, they were the superstars, much like Facebook, Google, Netflix and Tesla are today.
&gtI can't qualify for the loan for the tesla with my current carSo sell the BMW first&gtI can't qualify for the loan for the tesla with my current carHonestly sounds like you shouldn‚Äôt be buying a Tesla.

I bought a Tesla late 2019.  18 months later I've got 7000 miles on it.  I'm going to keep it, but I barely drive it, now that I am remote working.Covid has really changed the math on car ownership, especially when you consider insurance.
I've invested in ARK for a bit over a year, and I honestly think success has gotten to their heads. They pulled off something quite miraculous in 2020 march, since their max drawdown (ARKK) was about 31%, comparable to SPY. To be down only as much as SPY in the depths of a crash while being all in on speculative securities involves some degree of finesse. Since February of 2021, ARKK is facing similar drawdowns to March, but they are getting absolutely blasted compared to other stock market indicators (SPY, QQQ, QQQJ, MOON, other ARK funds even), and I think they aren't learning from their mistakes.They started buying many companies that were inside my circle of competence and I strongly disagree with their calls. They bought many SPACs at &gt40% premium over NAV and held through their drop straight back to NAV. They held $10 SPACs through merger just to see them tank below NAV - an unforgiveable sin in the SPAC world. Their 2025 valuation of Tesla is just asinine. The valuation itself can be justifiable, but their rationale that Tesla can create a $300B robotaxi business that one, doesn't exist today, and two, is several times larger than the global taxi industry today is bollocks. It doesn't inspire much confidence in their fundamental analysis. Its entirely possible to do growth and speculative only investing and still apply fundamental analysis in valuations.I don't understand why Cathy piled onto PLTR in the $20s range after it mooned from $10 in the DPO and $7 in the pre-DPO. ARK couldn't figure out that PLTR was good at $10, but only joined after it skyrocketed? I don't need a fund manager to FOMO into stocks for me. Also, if they decided that PLTR was a good value at $20, surely they could have sold sometime by the time it hit $40? Typically, I wouldn't fault a fund manager for not aggressively rotating positions, but due to how frequently ARK trades on a daily basis, there has to be some technical and fundamental reasons for rotating in and out of positions, and the lack of foresight to get out of overvalued companies is objectionable.  Finally, the fact that Cathy fully piled into COIN despite their obscene valuation and lack of moat (95% of revenue from trading fees?) was a terrible idea. It seems like Cathy is bent on buying disruptive businesses despite their valuation. I could do that myself if I just wanted to invest on disruptors and by social sentiment. The precipitous drop on COIN was totally predictable. Disclaimer: I still hold a substantial portion of my portfolio in ARK, though I have sold off the more I reviewed their daily trades, which don't inspire too much confidence for me. ARKF is still quite quality IMO since they have fewer garbage companies rather they have solid companies which may be expensive, but are durable growth.

My prediction for the next few days is: A chinese rocket is going to do a perfect landing next to Elon Musk, while he is hosting the SNL show.

Baba will go up another 50% on that news.Edit: sry for my english

So you think AWS is going to light piles of cash on fire, and all the while waste what is arguably the most valuable component (time) in trying to get a viable AV system to market? If we‚Äôre going to say something is laughable, that notion takes the cake. The EV/AV revolution is a high stakes race, Tesla got significantly ahead in many areas, legacy auto companies got caught with their pants around their ankles. Now the scramble ensues. I think Tesla will keep their superior edge in battery, motor design, and are changing the game on manufacturing of car frames and large components. But Tesla is having trouble with repeated fatal accidents from ‚ÄúFSD‚Äù which is a misnomer...they haven‚Äôt figured it out. Plus I highly doubt the OS will pass the scrutiny and security measures it needs to have in place to avoid hacking. BB has already achieved higher levels of approval and clearance then Tesla, Tesla can‚Äôt compete with BB in Data mining/sharing because Tesla would never sell its tech and capabilities to a competitor for obvious reasons. BB is not a direct competitor to all, so no concerns about who can or can‚Äôt be potential customers...the answer is everyone.

Yeah totally agree. And there is one big flaw in their Robotaxi argument. Uber today makes its mobility revenue 'globally' across multiple countries not just US. Tesla, for sake of argument, assume gets its Robotaxis approved and running on road by 2025 in the US, but it is almost impossible it will approval globally across multiple countries and have fleets running in each through their all bureaucracies by 2025. And without a global robotaxi fleet not sure how it will produce such high multiples of Uber by 2025
Seriously I short the dying movie theater chain that lost half a billion and it goes up. Tesla , Apple, Amd goes down.  I‚Äôll just coinflip next time
I see so much fear and anger in these threads these days. You know you can exit trades very easily these days and go into cash. Cash is king in a market like this, if you are completely hedged into the market then you're going to have a bad time until it recovers. Right now is the time to have cash waiting daily to make swing trades and take advantage of the cheap puts that are still out there.Tesla puts for August/September are so incredibly cheap and the value has been increasing week to week since it has leveled off. When you see money going from calls to puts then you start to reverse the trend. This is a cult stock but it's not impervious to market corrections or even common sense. Trade with conviction, do your own DD but most importantly don't trade with emotions (you lose almost every time). You can always make money on the runup and the rundown, just need to know when to get rid of the pride and those 20-50% losses you accumulated on growth stocks the last 5 months.
As soon as I started actually reading Ark‚Äôs projections, I noped the fuck out of holding their shares. Their DD is beyond ridiculous. I admittedly still read their yearly report as it contains some interesting data on trends and gets the mind churning, but their projections always go into absurd territory, especially with Tesla.
I sold Tesla when it was about 400 if I recall, pre 4 way stock split. AMA. Thought it was overvalued then. Have yet to let myself go on that one
The reason Tesla did the raises was because of the crazy increase in share price. They took advantage of it to get themselves enough money to expand even faster. That, and Musk‚Äôs options plan, which was also triggered by the share price increase.So, as a shareholder, I would love for them to dilute even more, in similar circumstances.
...and if you come back in, think diversity. For every Fiver, a Disney for every Tesla, a Union Pacific. Growth stocks and "latest hot things" should be less than half of your holdings. The rest should be longterm and diverse.
Im really hot for this stock its currently 70%+ of my port I truly believe this has the potential to be huge Apple in 2000 or Tesla a couple of years ago, this is the chance to get in the lift before it goes to the top floor, downside is you could lose some opportunity costs in waiting for that to happen but im happy to hold
So is every electric automaker a Tesla knockoff till the end of time?NIO did $2.5B in revenue last year.But yea, there‚Äôs always a risk with Chinese stocks
Feasible maybe, but unlikely. They already have the install base, just adding a ride sharing feature to the Tesla app would be way cheaper than buying out Uber or Lyft, with how overvalued those companies are. Look at how apple deals with competition, they create artificial boundaries, and then integrate their competitions ideas into existing products, effectively stifling what their "competition" does. All Tesla would need to do is restrict use of self driving to only their app, and Uber is dead.
It's not a bet, Tesla themselves have said so. The real bet is wether they will manage to do it and in a way that is profitable.
Do you think Uber wants to manage a ride-hailing fleet? The entire point of their current business model is that they only have an app. I don't see why it's more ridiculous that Tesla could figure out the backend part that Uber already has than Uber could and would successfully run a self-driving fleet of cars.
Would it be feasible for Tesla to simply acquire Uber or Lyft rather than license to them to trying to compete outright?
If politicians still had spines I would agree, but given the increasingly consolidated nature of core private services like email, search, transport, mobile OS, etc., and reluctance to take action, I am not confident that Tesla would be broken up.
Tesla definitely wants their own controlled taxi service and made it clear since first idea public announcement.Silicon valley company with billions in cash disposal can't make simple feature when they design chips for their AI uses already?
This is a precarious strategy. If Tesla, for example, owns the fleet *and* the self-driving tech, what need do they have of Uber? They'll integrate ride sharing into their own app. I imagine anyone else with remotely reliable self-driving will attempt the same.
I wish i could burn the $850 i profited but even thats gone along with 12k on tesla calls

&gt But all those investment or adaptions from Tesla, Paypal or the listing of Coinbase could be seen as a sign of mass adoption.Back in 2017 Bitcoin looked to be mass adopted as well. Microsoft, Dell, Steam, Tigerdirect, Wargaming and many other companies big and small started to accept Bitcoin payments for their products, but it went nowhere - mostly because technology was immature, and couldn't cope with the massive traffic. This time might be different, but it may misfire again as well.
I mean you could argue completely different.It‚Äôs true that crypto went through cyclic movements in the past and that the market is currently pumping strongly.But all those investment or adaptions from Tesla, Paypal or the listing of Coinbase could be seen as a sign of mass adoption. So maybe no cyclic bear market is coming for crypto and it remains relatively stable.It‚Äôs all very speculative and you might as well ask your magic 8-Ball.In my opinion this is a very interesting time to start to invest in crypto with good fundamentals. But I definitely would only start with a part of your money.
Actually hilarious. There is no brand in that pricerange with more defects than a Tesla, even current gen. But still, teslas are pretty cool.

Nothing wrong with having international but it's not essential.I guess I'm with Warren Buffet.  My faith is in the US economy.  All the leading tech companies are US.  The US is leading the space race.  Despite Europe's efforts to regulate a green economy into existence in the 00s, Tesla was born in the US.  Even the push for next-gen nukes is in the US.  With the gazillions in fortunes that America's tech lead has generated, I think we can expect the US to lead new technologies for some time to come.
\&gt screw that garbage\&gt getting a TeslaEven though you made money you still definitely belong here
Lol screw that garbage. Getting a Tesla.
Ask and he shall receive:  Lord I ask that you please runneth up Tesla to nothin short of $720 tomorrow. Amen.
I hope Tesla found it's bottom today or my bottom going to gaped
tesla is the best girlfriend, it fucks me everyday
Tesla owner chiming in, can confirm, quality is shit and so is service. My last Tesla
Bro. Tesla is on Mars. Have you seen the year chart or nah?
The internet thing is SpaceX.. SpaceX isn't tesla.They're not dominating solar.They're not special battery tech. They basically use roughly the same batteries as everyone else. Maybe they have a slight advantage, but that's about it... slight. Just like ICE car sales don't gravitate towards a single manufacturer, so the same will happen with EVs.
&gt Name a legacy automaker who grew overall sales over 30% in the last year or two.What a nonsense comparison. Of course tesla is going to grow their sales more, its because they were barely making any before.
It's a lot easier to grow 30% from 400k sales a year than from 12 million (Toyota).The problem with Tesla is they're doomed to never live up to the hype.  They don't deliver on time and if the stock gets really bad news it's going to tank.  A major recall of the Model3/Y would be a disaster.
VW has announced that their electric cars will be profitable by 2022.  Legacy automakers don't need to build factories, they already have them.  You know what else they have?  Parts suppliers, product support through dealer networks and the ability to scale production within a single model year.  They also don't have shit quality control.Tesla has structural advantages right now that let them do things that avoid costs, such as fixing cars post delivery and only redesigning cars every decade.  There's no reason to believe either of those practices are sustainable long term.
SBC is not a one off expense when it is a consistent part of staff compensation packages, as is the case with Tesla.
But Tesla is already priced as if it sells every single car in the world
I don't buy the argument that the other automakers are giving 100%.   They are giving marketing the 100% treatment, but not the supply chain.  For example, while GM is targeting 30 new BEV by 2025, the volume of BEV that they expect to produce is only 250,000 total units.[When forecasting sales of just GM‚Äôs expected 18 passenger and light commercial EV models in the US (including models from Cruise and BrightDrop, but not Honda/Acura or Navistar), the company would reach sales of less than 250,000 by 2025. And because many of these models would be higher-end GMC and Cadillac models, the overall average volume per model comes out to less than 13,400.](https://evadoption.com/what-does-gms-30-new-evs-by-2025-promise-mean-for-the-us-market/)For reference, 250,000 units is the low-end growth target for Tesla in 2021. By 2025, Tesla will likely produce and sell 10-20x this number of vehicles. (2.5-5.0 million units)
Lol, Tesla MEMEs won‚Äôt like this. Why I finally sold my stock after 8 years.
Just sold Tesla and bought more GME. Added 60 shares!
Have you driven a recent Merc or BMW? Autonomous driving is almost on Tesla level in the S-Class, but boy does a Tesla feel cheaply built in comparison. I think, the Germans were sleeping for a long while, but right now they are awake. Tesla has a brand that is very valuable, but they are not alone anymore.
Ah, the ol' Reddit Tesla is a ~~car manufacturer~~ ~~solar panel~~ ~~energy grid~~ software service company switch-eroo.
It‚Äôs not tesla trading 700x pe or Uber not profitable or draft kings not profitable or snap not profitable As of today earnings it‚Äôs trading at 21x pe which is less than historically s&ampp average it‚Äôs undervalued
What‚Äôs the margin on a Ferrari vs a Tesla?
One of my best friends has a Tesla M3 DM. Driving experience is all that you can hope for and some more. Build quality and attention to detail when comparing to my VW is atrocious. Exposed panel edges, exposed trim edges, aerodynamic noise, uneven moon roof, panel gaps, the sound of the doors, trunk and frunk that seem like you're closing a tuna can and the lack of physical buttons for some important functions is simply too much to look the other way when buying in such an expensive car.That's why I think if Tesla doesn't up their quality and attention to detail, they're going to have a very hard time once other manufactures figure out more competitive motors and batteries.
If you want to be as accurate as possible in your wording, it would probably be better to say that it is highly unlikely that Tesla is accurately priced. The analogy here is "Tesla" is a mining company. They were created solely to mine a special mountain, and bought the mining rights to this mountain felt to have fantastic gold reserves. Because of that, everyone wants to buy shares in this company. To the point where demand for shares on the market has lead to the value of each share sky-rocketing. To the point where the stock price people are willing to pay implies they believe that the volume of gold in this mountain is 5x total existing world reserves.While no one knows for sure the exact volume of gold deposits in this mountain, it seems very unlikely that it contains that much gold. Investors in this company however either believe: that it does in fact contain that much gold (they are completely certain and can't be dissuaded), that the reason why the stock is worth so much is because they make really good mining equipment ("Tesla is actually a pickax company, not a gold company"), or that someone else will be willing to pay an even higher price for the stock in the future regardless of its true value.
Tesla isn't valued like a tech company, it's an Elon company that also makes tech.
&gtnarrative that the shorts are pushinbro, there are no shorts left... they've all got blown out to see\&gt . They aren't making money without credits because they are simultaneously building multiple factories at once,  you don't understand accounting, this is not how accounting works. you're confusing the income statement and the cash flow statement. \&gt China finally pulls some shenanigans, those cars are still going to be sold to the Asian markets. have you read the agreement between tesla and china, the chinese government can take over the factory if tesla does not fulfill its side of the agreement. Also, china is an authoritarian government, they can simply take over the factory because they want to \&gt however it is sandboxed. It will not work for a general vehicle. Vision based FSD will likely be here sooner than you are expecting (I'd guess 3-5 years). Waymo uses both vision and lidar, tesla only uses lidar. we still don't even know how tesla stores all the data and information it captures. Tesla trying to use a neural net for full self driving is a fools errand. Computers don't work the same way in processing as humans do. There is a reason that waymo is using lidar. If you go back to musks comments about lidar in the beginning it was because it was too expensive, lidar pricing has come down significantly. Add the fact that tesla is literally the only company not using lidar is pretty telling as well\&gt but long term I still think they will be the Apple of the automotive world. Why? apple has massive margins, makes a shit ton of cash, and has a completely different business model. Its the same argument about tesla and amazon that makes zero sense. They are completely different businesses. Its like saying that an oilfield service company is going to be the google of the oilfield - just a completely empty statement.
Yep, this is the issue with NOK. It needs a 1-10 reverse split or a *massive* stock buyback. There is just way too much stock out there for this thing to move significantly without Tesla-like momentum behind it. Which then just becomes a cyclical problem, because fewer people will invest in a stock that doesn't move, which causes it to move even less.
If anything, this sub (Reddit in general) seems oblivious that there's a world outside the US and that other car makers exist at all. Look at this thread, everyone is brushing off VW, when they're infinitely more trusted and popular in Europe and much of the rest of the world. Where I live everyone is buying Toyota hybrids. People with money go for BMWs. Tesla has lots of things going for it and maybe has an important market share in the US but it's not as interesting to the rest of the world.
Elon gives up Tesla to pursue corn farming
Teslas are very good and very interesting cars, and it is amazing that the company got this far with all of the challenges to stand up a new auto company. But, the stock is priced to perfection and VW, Honda and Toyota are very good competitors not to mention further disruption from tech companies and the risk Tesla like any company trips on something.  Many Tesla bulls just don‚Äôt see valuation as an issue at any price and at some point there has to be a DCF model supporting the price. To get that model to work, I think Tesla needs to develop a lot more revenue streams than just cars which is possible. I am rooting for them but skeptical.
They literally are ranked 2nd to last by consumer reports and one of the last by JD power. Just because your anecdotal stories say one thing, does not mean that the broader data is wrong. They are what 20 years old at this point, how can anyone call that early process of making cars? they have terrible build quality and haven't been able to make money with their highest priced vehicles. Their vehicle pricing will only decrease from here to "unlock more demand" decreasing margins. Without government subsidies (which includes the FCA credits) they would never have made a profit in the history of the company, I don't see that as a sustainable business model. Even when they blow out deliveries they still can't make money on the actual operations of the company. Add in tail risk of FSD not actually working, the promise of L5 driving tech when they only have 2, china risk factors, and the fact that their other business units that people try and tout don't grow or make money (energy for instance, look at the last 3 years of solar deployments) and I don't really see whats so attractive especially at this price. They also have massive competition that will sell cars at a loss in order to capture the credits themselves, leading to more pressure on TEsla pricing. I just don't see what there is to be bullish about, 10 years ago sure there was a bull case but now everyone has caught up and surpassed them, at least on the car manufacturing side. Waymo and others are already beyond them on the autonomous driving side. So what really is there?
Give Tesla two years. This year into next, chip shortages will limit the impact of traditional autos into market. It‚Äôs likely margins will shrink with mass manufacturing. There will be lots of $35k to $50k EVs fighting to upend Tesla.
It won't even be quality issues that are a nail in the coffin for Tesla's leadership status. It's gonna be its continued lack of existing service infrastructure. I can get almost any issue with my ICE car fixed at 10 different places within a 15 minute drive and a week or two. Spare parts can usually be delivered within a day or less. The anecdotes about people trying to get repairs on their Tesla done are really off-putting. Tesla's range advantage is also shrinking with every new release by other manufacturers.
Overall EV sales are growing over 100% a year. It's impossible to not lose market share, because Tesla can't double their production every single year. That's just common sense.
&gt rarely both.i know tesla has been compared with apple before - but they might just be that gem. Apple is great at both software and hardware!
Toyota has a PS ratio of .86, Volkswagen .67. Tesla 20.84. You have to assume there's going to be a fundamental change in the automotive industry that will increase its razor tight margins. Tech is valued so highly because the product it sells has low or non-existent unit costs - allowing for huge margin. It's also minimally price sensitive, if Spotify increased prices 25% next month I would keep my subscription because it's easier then remaking all my playlists. This allows for quick EPS growth.Cars are always going to be expensive to make because they're built from expensive stuff, packed with complicated technology, must adhere to incredibly strict safety standards and run for decades. Next to your house it's the biggest purchase you'll make, meaning price is going to play a huge factor for most people. This keeps margins tight, particularly when competitors are so numerous.Tesla is trying to build out the service aspect of it's cars. Anything they come up with on that front will become ubiquitous if it's popular. Self driving for example. The utility nature of cars, being a means to get from one place to another, makes it more difficult to build as a service. Every cruise liner, airline, bus, railway network has found this hence thin margin.For national pride, the economy and national security, countries will not allow their vehicle industries to die. The European, Japanese, Korean and Chinese brands will be propped up even if they somehow can't compete with the newcomer. That means Tesla will never have 100% of the market, it will never have even 50%, its growth is capped.Unless there's something very specific about Tesla that you thinks justifies it being valued at 30x the sales of car companies that will likely end up with similar market-share at the end of the day then I'd just put my money in Volkswagen.
I read that their profit reports said over 100 percent of their quarterly profit was from selling back carbon credits and Bitcoin.https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-makes-more-money-trading-bitcoin-than-selling-cars-11619517615
I'd argue that software is equally as difficult. Legacy auto makers for the most part have used cheap chips to get the job done at the sacrifice of the user experience. Knowing that some form of executive made that decision, they're already of the wrong mindset. Over the air updates are obviously a huge advantage for Tesla which other manufacturers can utilise but that would be like putting sprinkles on shit if the chips are underperforming. It's the age old agreement that there's always great hardware companies and great software companies but rarely both. I do think you're right that now they can use Tesla as a point of reference for a solid user experience, they may have an easier time on what improvements they should be focusing on.
Because it's obnoxiously overpriced.I don't know how others feel, but the world needs thousands of more Musk's. Tesla is interesting and cool. It forcing needed changes in multiple sectors. But it's market cap should not be more than the 9 leading car manufacturers combined. And I don't feel their data harvesting makes up that gap either.
I'm excited for all of the evs coming to the market. I feel like VW/Audi is in the best position to take over the suburban living market of buyers. However, Tesla has that name value. And if they keep pushing into commercial market, they don't have to worry that much about consumer market. Tesla needs to setup shipping yards to for their 18wheelers to charge and go from 1 location to the other, they could partner with amazon or ups or fedex. I don't know. I am just more excited about the commercial applications than consumer. EV cars will become a commodity, like computers did.
This that, just picked up a used Etron, for less of a price than a model Y.  No contest in interior design, build quality, and the road noise. Tesla autopilot and insane performance are the only things I'll miss.
software may be much easier to improve than build quality (not that i'm saying tesla build quality is poor - don't have the privilege of owning one yet to tell).
Why does this sub hate Tesla so much
Tesla up 0.01%. Bullish
&gt	if they do not significantly scale up their production capacity, they simply will not be able to keep upI hope someone from Tesla is reading this hot take. I‚Äôm sure no one has even though about scaling production over there yet.
Yes, and Tesla's market share will shrink a lot more. Does is matter? No. The important metrics are units sold, revenue and profitability. Tesla vehicles are expensive, it stands to reason that manufacturers offering cheaper cars will outsell Tesla substantially in the future. VW for instance is going to offer a car for less than 20,000 EUR (including 20% sales tax).
This viewpoint is so hilarious. Since the Model S launched, Tesla sales have grown stupendously year-on-year in just under a decade, despite the very public build quality issues. The demand is insatiable. The notion that consumers will pay a premium for German vehicles with worse technology simply because of fit and finish is amusingly deluded.
Build quality is not the whole experience anymore. While Tesla have continued to refine their build quality over the years, Tesla buyers also enjoy the ease of use software when compared to ID4 etc. In fact, ID4's software was laughable if you watched the 'Munro live - ride &amp drive ID4' clip.Tesla have a lot of scaling up to do but there's still no solid price/performance vehicle that matches the integration of speed/range/software in one simple package. However, there's some EV's with better interior quality.
Tesla is selling every car they make. Long wait times for deliveries too, demand is higher.
Built in germany, but with Tesla quality manuals.
Tesla will get shit on by german and japanese build quality
Tbf they are selling every car they can make and increasing production by 50% year on year. This is just the market growing largely as a result of Tesla proving the superiority of EVs.
Fellow Tesla bulls are you still alive üòî
For some reason it feels like a $60,000 Tesla is more affordable than a $60,000 Mercedes.
&gt I can‚Äôt see BTC &amp ETH going anywhere but up with all the mainstream adoption and institutional acceptance we‚Äôre seeingWhat exactly do you mean by mainstream adoption? IMO crypto needs to establish its legitimacy as a currency and actually be able to be used to purchase goods/services beyond a Tesla or very specific things. The catch 22 is that the volatility is holding it back from being a practical currency, keeping it mostly a speculative investment which drives volatility etc.

Yes, yes, banks are evil and terrible narrative. Heard it a lot. Sure they do a lot of scummy things but don‚Äôt underestimate what the innovation in capital markets has done for the western world. Being able to efficiently move money from savers to spenders in an efficient and responsible way is often overlooked. We wouldn‚Äôt have Tesla or Apple or any of our modern industry without capital markets that can move billions of dollars in a moments notice from savers to spenders. If Bitcoin can reproduce this, then yes, it will be valuable to civilization.

Here's the actual way it's going to end:1. A self driving Tesla crashes into a Federal Reserve meeting, killing all the chairs and Janet Yellen.2. In a senior moment, Biden appoints Cathie Woods to be the new Fed chair.3. The Fed announces they'll begin purchasing PLTR equities.4. Redditors become the richest group of people in the world. 5. Backtracking on his promise to never do it again, God sees this and floods humanity a 2nd time.6. SPY undergoes a 37% correction for a couple months, before proceeding to go on the biggest 15 yr bull run in history.
Rubbish. Dow will hit 40k end of the year. Low interest rate, cheap money, low bond yields, post Covid boom, etc these all are fuelling market to rise. Cheap money always end up in stock market. Next two years GDP will be ATH due to sudden pause in economy by Covid &amp then mega QE globally. Lastly, stock market doesn‚Äôt trade anymore with fundamentals &amp technicals, the relation has been broken long time ago. When I see tesla a trillion dollar company, Bitcoin 60k, GME 300, I often ask myself what‚Äôs the point of having a financial degree, just bet to win or lose!

Always take some profits. I rode the tesla wave to the top and always kept taking profits. Learned this the hard way at 24, but thankfully it was a cheap lesson. Would I have made more if I kept 100% in Tesla? Sure, but its important to stick to sound planned investing activities to remove the emotions and bias.
Not all Tesla
Tesla to 750 this week baby.
Even cars are sold out and dealers are gouging buyers.Every other person is driving a 60-120k Tesla/Porsche/Rover.Houses selling for 100k over asking in the NY area the morning they‚Äôre listed.Some dude here saying SPY might hit 600 this year.This is one of those periods you‚Äôll look back on in a year and think ‚Äúhow could I not realize how out of hand things had gotten.‚ÄùCash gang.
It‚Äôs all about the platform your looking into - for EVs (sedan size cars) - it makes no sense - when looking to trucks (like Tesla Semi) hydrogen is the better alternative vs batteries - The bigger the engine / vehicle to move the higher is the efficiency of hydrogen vs battery ! Simple physics = batteries don‚Äôt like mass to move - hydrogen gets stronger the heavier the mass to move is ...
This may be the wrong sub to ask depending on the density of Tesla fanboys but is Ballard's hydrogen fuel cells a viable alternative to lithium battery currently used in Tesla cars? It's greener to mine/ produce and EVs are the future,  I'm thinking about putting a grand in Ballard for while . Good or bad idea?
What, you didn‚Äôt see the video of the guy shoot electric arcs from his EV charger at robbers like a Tesla coil?
&gt The demand for a Tesla is actually insane[Insane demand isn't just a Tesla thing](https://old.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/n20knh/a_tale_of_the_current_used_truck_market/).
The demand for a Tesla is actually insane. There is a 2-3 month wait to get a car delivered to you here in Canada, similar times are also there in Eastern U.S and several weeks around California. I test drove the model 3, they only had a single 3 and a Y, everything else was sold. It is like the entire dealership was stripped of everything they have. You can also go to Tesla Motors Forum where a lot of people input their order dates, and they complete the spreadsheet once they received the car, this way the spreadsheet can tell us some patterns of their delivery dates. The spreadsheet is truly massive, you could perhaps run a data analysis on that. The issue isn't selling the cars what most dealers face, Tesla cannot make their cars fast enough to satisfy the crazy demand. Once Germany and Texas are fully operational, there is going to be an enormous push for even better numbers.
i made 10k on a Tesla call the first time I ever tried trading TSLA options. I felt like a genius. I proceeded to lose 15k the next week lol
tesla is literally 80% of my portfolio. It is the only stock I own with enough confidence that the volatility means nothing to me.
I used to tell people about stocks I thought were buys. I was right on every one (anyone could say tesla, apple, amazon, sirius sat radio when it was pennies but I was pretty early guessing they were worth buying) I never purchased one share. I suck
I'm tired of seeing the same incorrect, copy-and-paste "concerns" about Tesla and their business model. The income from regulatory credits and their position in Bitcoin was chump change compared to the amount of overall revenue they generated. Regulatory Credits: +$518 million BTC sale: +101 millionGross Profit: **$2.2 billion** from $10.4 billion in revenue. The two main complaints in this thread and across finance are basically insignificant when you look at the actual numbers the company is putting up. I don't understand why we can't applaud Musk and co. for finding new ways to shore up the balance sheet and remain cash-flow positive. And do we seriously think that the headlines about the crash caused institutions and retail to sell en masse causing this pullback? The answer is no - it's a ridiculous assumption. It's healthy price action &amp the media is just bored and they can't let Tesla go for one week without letting everyone know -- it's still Tesla doing Tesla things. Sick of people parroting the same 3 lazy soundbytes everywhere about why Tesla is "overvalued." It might be, but it's NOT because of their Bitcoin position, and it's NOT because of the regulatory sales, and it is NOT because of a one-off tragic accident or whatever the hell it is on Musk's Twitter feed right now.
didn't you know that Tesla has only existed since about 2018 when Cathie bought it and Elon became a meme? before that there was no stock and no people ever bought it/someone who also bought in about 2013
I‚Äôve lost the value of a model 3 playing Tesla
Have fun when tesla hits 1000!
The actual number of deliveries before Tesla publicly announces it.
1 week before earnings Tesla already said they beat estimated deliveries on vehicles so I'm not sure why this would be news.  (Source - disgruntled 1000 call holder with expiration today)

Let‚Äôs take into consideration that the company is far more undervalued when it is being compared with other archaic  medical insurance companies with stock price ranging from 100 dollars up to 400 dollars per stock.With its revolutionary technology (AI) used in the insurance sector, this stock can EASILY 10x in a matter of months . It‚Äôs getting approved in more and more states and counties .Chamath especially loves this company because it uses artificial intelligence technology to analyze customers‚Äô data. Think about how Tesla went from 5 dollars to 500 dollars a share in just a few months . If I see CLOV hitting 20 by the end of this week , I would not be surprised . The company is currently undervalued because of those fucking shorters who hate new startups with disruptive technology .CLOV is the Tesla of the healthcare insurance sector. With Democrats‚Äô control of the house , Medicare will expand significant in the next few months .If you missed MVIS, RKT, Tesla , or even SKT. This is your chance . Bottom line, I will see you on the moon apes ü¶çüöÄüíé

Buy Tesla got it. Thanks for the DD.
Lol I can't believe you're putting Tesla there and not Microsoft.
Need Tesla to gap up to at least 720 tomorrow

What is cool about Tesla is that if you can afford a black Model 3...you still look like a baller. Its weird because its only like 30k.
I'm new to the game. I fomoed like a dipshit and bought 400 shares at 75 but didn't sell. Then I found salvation in r/thetagang. But all high activity stocks seem to have pretty good premiums. I recently convinced my boomer uncle to sell some fd weeklies on tesla before earnings because he was going to sell anyway, and made like 1500 free money.
I‚Äôd rather be cooked alive inside a Tesla than be seen driving a Ford Mach E ü§°
Well I have always said that this is not just a squeeze . This is not just a meme stock . The company is far more undervalued when it is being compared with other archaic  medical insurance companies . Chamath especially loves this company because it uses artificial intelligence technology to analyze customers‚Äô data. Think about how Tesla went from 5 dollars to 500 dollars a share in just a few months . If I see CLOV hitting 20 by the end of this week , I would not be surprised . The company is currently undervalued because of those fucking shorters who hate new startups with disruptive technology .CLOV is the Tesla of the healthcare insurance sector. With Democrats‚Äô control of the house , Medicare will expand significant in the next few months .Bottom line, I will see you on the moon apes ü¶çüöÄüíé
I can see how the overall market cap will increase. There isn‚Äôt a flood of new buys wanting to get in at 3400/share but I‚Äôd buy Amazon at 425-850 etc. because in a few years I expect these to run up back to 1500-2000 just random numbers but u get the idea. Look at Tesla...
Is Tesla allergic to green days? Upvote for yes.

You realise in 26 years or so Tesla will stop being a growth stock relying solely on Elon and more an actual solid company.Take for example Steve jobs dying and Apple.. wasn‚Äôt really a crash in the stock price then, however if it happened earlier then it would‚Äôve had more of an effect (speculation)

MVIS and Tesla FD's at open, let's get it boiz
Being bearish on tesla at current P/E makes perfect sense what are you smoking?  Why would you group them with Amazon like that pairing made any sense?
Keep in mind that there are also ppl bearish on Amazon/tesla and the fact that the earth is round. It comes with the territory
Tesla: earnings crush, sales crush, outlook over 50% growth, analyst price targets rise, stock? Down 10%

Okay so Tesla fucked me for earnings (which I expected) and fucked me yesterday. No way it can fuck me three times in a row right? ü•∞
Tesla deadass made more selling the coin held for a month than cars sold the last 14 years
Honestly the fuck is up with this sub going nutso with retarded bullshit companies? At least when this sub was going crazy about Tesla it was an actual insane technology revolutionizing company
Fuck me and my Tesla call

Tesla. Elon. Im not begging but I need Tesla to fly again. I need to eat and the boys are hungry. Mikey aint gonna make it to Friday if we keep eating tree bark. So final offer. First born son.
why did my dumbass buy tesla fd's prior to earnings. i had to double down this morning at the dip... BEFORE THE ACTUAL DIP. Severely cucked... literally not going to look until Thursday close at this point. I have no choice. &amp#x200BElon Musk Man, ples fly again
It‚Äôs like buying tesla weeklies

Oh, good earnings report! Lets fucking plummet into the center of the earth explode what the fuck Tesla and Microsoft...
Dear tesla, please go fuck yourself. Thank you.
You do realize Elon Musk was on CNN all the time when Tesla wasn't even public?
and tesla last year
Tesla currently has about 1.5 operational factories and is somehow making a profit off that while building 2.5 more factories. What happens in about 6 months when Tesla has 4 functioning factories and significantly less drag on revenue while still getting free money from ZEV credits? It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure the next few quarters and years are going to be very good for Tesla
Careful dude Tesla investors get extremely sensitive when you provide logical evidence that it's not a good investment at current prices
If you‚Äôre spending $700+ on a tesla share in the year of our lord 2021 may I suggest a frontal lobotomy instead
I put my money in tesla because i have a pain kink
Get ready for that tesla Guh at open bois. I'm lubed and ready
&gt	I don‚Äôt understand how there‚Äôs still so many people comparing Tesla to Toyota/car companies.Assuming this question isn‚Äôt sarcastic, because they both make cars.
TSLA has mastered the art of making money from non core business.  The  revenue from regulatory credits jumped 46% to $518 million and recorded  $272 million proceeds from sales of digital assets.  Contrary to general wisdom, it looks like the more ancillary stuff Tesla does, the better it is for profits..üòÑ
That's a great goal, but wow they're going to double Toyota's amount of cars sold a year every year for the next 9 years?  Even if EVs rapidly become the main mode of transportation, you're essentially betting on every other EV release become an utter failure.  Renault is outselling Tesla in Europe.  In North America, I'm seeing more and more e-Golfs on the road every day.  Obviously, I'm seeing way more Teslas than any other EVs, but we'll see what the situation is in 5 years.If I wanted an EV and I was on a budget, I would buy the Kia EV.  If I was rich and I wanted an EV, I'd probably go for the e-Tron, as it's way sicker and European.
If you're paying close attention to the bitcoin sale and how they helped their profits, stop what you're doing and go listen to the conference call. Many more important things happened that are going to fly under the radar. For example: Elon said he believes Model Y will be the best selling car of ant type in 2022. He later clarified in a tweet that 2022 by revenue and 2023 by volume. Who cares about a 100M profit or not? If Tesla keeps growing deliveries at 50+% the stock is going to moon even higher over the next 10 years
Tesla going stupid high tomorrow. Why? Because it‚Äôs fucking Tesla
Tesla green by morning
Hoping my Tesla 1000c‚Äôs 4/30 print tomorrow. Letssss goooooo
If you listened to the earnings call for Tesla today I advise you to sell at open tomorrow and don‚Äôt look back‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a logistics nightmare that makes world war 2 seem trivial‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so simple, if we had an area of 100 sq miles by 100sq miles of solar panels we would generate enough energy for all of the US‚Äù‚ÄúModel Y to be the best selling car or truck in 2022‚ÄùJust some highlights. These are the ramblings of a lunatic.
Every 3 comments is related to mvis, the other 2 are for Tesla and Mind Mend.
That would truly haunt me more than it going to zero. Like many times more.It‚Äôs like Tesla. I sold my shares at about 400 (pre split) for a tidy profit! :(
Of course Tesla fkn crushes earnings but still drops. I have no positions but ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù can still go fuck themselves
Tesla 792 eow spy 422 eow you heard it here first
How is my Tesla Bull family doing?We hurting?

Everyone got fucked on Tesla earnings except whoever wrote calls and puts
Some idiots bet on falling prices. Just too bad if prices aren't falling.Back in early 2020 Tesla was the NYSE's most shorted stock with an short interest of 18%. 20% is considered to be very high.GameStop was about 140% short.
Tesla had such a disappointing earnings report. It‚Äôs probably going to drill but who knows. Elon sounded like you couldn‚Äôt pay him enough to sound enthusiastic about Tesla
Tesla could cure cancer and still drop $50 the same day.
Can‚Äôt wait to burn my house down with a Tesla battery and have the firetruck steer into a tree on the way here
It was practically dead in the water back in January, then shot dead at Earnings Report. They had practically more cash on hand than debt * before* the latest earnings report. Combined with holiday season on an absurdly in-demand fresh console cycle and closing of low-performance stores, they were doing alright as just a "failing retailer". Then Earnings comes along and they announce they paid off all their long-term debt *early*? The short thesis was and is completely dead, and it was hilarious listening to all the "bUt FUnDamEnTals!" morons. Yeah, fundamentals point to this being your next big opportunity to see explosive value. If you missed the Amazon pre-COVID jump, missed Square, missed Shopify, missed Netflix, missed Tesla, etc...well this is your opportunity. The squeeze is just all gravy. The real play was always GME transforming itself.

Tesla does this all the time. It will drop the first 2-3 days after earnings beat. And then rocket 1 week later
Tesla post record earnings therefore it takes a giant shit? I have no idea how to interpret anything I must be fucking retarded

Tesla is going to blow away expectations. Everywhere you go you see a model 3 now. Watch.
I cant wait till Tesla smashes earnings and stock tank 10%

On Tesla earnings days after hours is when the fun begins. LFG!
Alright boys i have ONE tesla 740 weekly. Wish me luck.
Tesla logo pattern forming on spy before earnings - hella bullish
I need Tesla to hit 1000 by Friday.

No number is going to match Tesla expectations. One way trip down
Jack to the tits, will yolo 25k on tesla shares at 3.59 pm today.I either eat butter chicken or will be behind wendys
Tesla being calm before earnings actually makes a post earnings dip less likely imo
I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to go full retard and go into Tesla rn. Wish me luck boys.
That would go to Tesla lol
y‚Äôall think Tesla will beat earnings? well basically idgaf about that. do you think it‚Äôs going to crash more?

I mean that's literally what everybody said about Tesla until this year
[This](https://imgur.com/a/w9764yT) was the "business plan" I wrote 3 years ago on a piece of cardboard. I didn't know shit. I had just read the Google whitepaper by Sergei and Larry on a heroic dose of LSD and was manic. People must have thought I was nuts. Maybe I am.  The Tesla arrives in June.
This is like tesla few years back.
Doesn‚Äôt Tesla own a lot of corn? Good earnings vs bag holding corn. Which shall win?
Buying more Tesla.
my barber told me today he thinks that the government is tracking us via vaccine, he also asked me what stock to buy over a year ago, i said tesla (my entire portfolio), he bought nikola at like 70. now it makes sense.
I mean buying growthy tech names in the news no matter the valuations has worked nicely last decade. Think about how many people bet teh farm on Tesla mostly on a meme.
Exactly, all it takes is to luck out with one of the assets. I bought a few Tesla shares in 2018 with a cost basis around $68, never imagined getting 10x return on it. I knew nothing about investing.
One does not simply short Tesla.If you want to simp away your money then onlyfans.
You. don't. short. Tesla.

i need the entire tesla fleet to crash tonight
I shit talked Tesla a lot today. ‚ÄúTesla‚Äôs going down. Puts. Cratering!‚Äù And for some reason it did the opposite. You can bet your ass that means I‚Äôm gonna shit talk Tesla again tomorrow. What a garbage company, out here making great products and making me money.
So, what would you say has been happening to Tesla for the past month genius? 1 month charts are free on Google. I don't "predict the past". I look at the present, unlike you, who's trying to "predict the future".What do you call a 20% move from under 600 to 700+? Boy, I wish I could get crushed like that.
Added to my Tesla put position at the top againFucking nailed it.
I've heard this narrative a couple of times now, the higher the price the higher the risk, which I do not completely agree with. To say that the risk increases means to discount all the progress  and lead Tesla still has - The EV market is no where near saturated.

Great DD. I have been doing a lot of research on automotive LiDAR for some time (i am a physics student). I want to talk about the prospects of MicroVision‚Äôs LiDAR technology from first principles, so we can better understand their place in the LiDAR landscape.First, we need to understand the different parts of the LiDAR system design. LiDAR works by shooting a laser of a particular wavelength towards a target, whereby the process of [diffuse reflection](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection) some of that light is reflected off of the target and back towards the LiDAR unit. At this point, the LiDAR unit will detect the light of the known wavelength using a sensor. This sensor will tell the LiDAR system‚Äôs software how far away the target is by using the principle of [time of flight](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_flight) and with enough of these data points, it will construct a 3D picture of its environment. So what are the main components of the LiDAR unit? Well in order for the laser to be able to scan a particular Field Of View (FOV), it requires some kind of scanner that reflects the laser beam throughout a specified FOV. Then we have the sensor, the laser itself, and the software which processes the data. In each of these LiDAR components many varying design choices are being studied. We start with the laser. There are three main design choices here. You can do pulsed lasers which works exactly as it sounds. You can also do [Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave(FMCW) LiDAR](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/home/article/16556322/lasers-for-lidar-fmcw-lidar-an-alternative-for-selfdriving-cars). Lastly, you can do Amplitude Modulated Continuous Wave (AMCW) LiDAR, which is just the Amplitude analog of FMCW. Now let‚Äôs talk about the scanner. There are 4 approaches i am familiar with. 1. Mechanical scanner (this is the LiDAR that is mounted on top of the car that continuously rotates).This scanner gives us the most accurate data but it is expensive, ugly, and potentially unreliable because moving parts are susceptible to being unreliable.2. [MEMs Scanners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscanner). These are a proposed solution to the reliability problem of the mechanical scanner. Proponents of this scanner say it is a solid state solution, but it really isnt. There is movement inside the MEMs scanner, it just happens at a small scale, but this movement occurs in multiple degrees of freedom and is susceptible to noise. 3. [Optical phased array](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased-array_optics). This one is really interesting because it is genuinely solid state, but a lot of research is needed on this technology.4. 2 axis scanning mirror. This is just a mirror that rotates about 2 axis.I won‚Äôt go into detail about the sensor because i think this is the least important part of LiDAR but it still requires some further development.Lastly, the software component is extremely important. Many algorithms are being developed to help sense lane lines, stop signs, and all other road signage that requires color detection. And of course, you need to solve the driving problem given the 3D point cloud data that the LiDAR hardware is providing just like Tesla is solving the driving problem given the 2D images (camera) they receive. At this point, it should be clear that there are many parts of the LiDAR problem that require further research. MicroVision seems to only be working seriously on the scanner problem. In particular, MicroVision is developing the MEMs technology. I‚Äôm not sure if their MEMs is any better than anyone else‚Äôs but they are ride or die on 1) MEMs being the solution that works and 2) having the best MEMs. MicroVision does not ever talk about lasers, sensors, or software (although they do use the buzzword machine learning but that‚Äôs just a buzzword) so this leads me to believe that they just aren‚Äôt working seriously on these parts of LiDAR which will be necessary for a complete LiDAR solution. Luminar, on the other hand, is using the 2 axis scanner. Additionally, they are taking a holistic approach to LiDAR. They are developing the lasers, sensors, scanners, and software. They have an excellent reputation within the field as being really good and recruiting good talent. MicroVision does not have this reputation. Final point. It does not matter how many units any company right now is selling. Every single LiDAR company is in the R&ampD phase right now and will be for some time. My conclusion, MicroVision will not create a complete LiDAR solution for autonomous driving. They MIGHT create a scanner solution and become a component distributor to a company that develops a compete LiDAR solution if MEMs wins out. I suspect it wont but that‚Äôs a matter of personal opinion. Luminar has a much greater chance of developing a complete LiDAR solution. Im not going to place a valuation on the LiDAR side of MicroVision‚Äôs business (I‚Äôll let you do that given my DD), but I can tell you it‚Äôs nowhere near $11B in my opinion.
Be careful, one thing about GME, don't make bets you can't afford to lose because every creature from the lagoon here will try and run up Tesla so they can make you eat your own ballsack.
How the fuck did someone as stupid as Cathie become in control of so much money. If Tesla reaches $1400 in a year I‚Äôll eat my own ball sac. She took a company that is extremely overvalued and said it would double? I want whatever the fuck she‚Äôs smoking!
I LOVE YOU CATHIE. SERIOUSLY, THANK YOU FOR BELIEVING IN TESLA AND PALANTIR FROM THE BEGINNING.
And it's absolutely WONDERFUL that this happens. Kmart used to be a massively shit company to people, they were booted out by companies going online. Walmart is pretty shit, and it's not too far behind. The next big thing will be car dealers. They think they are such hot shit, but places like carvana are making it to where you can just do it all online so easily. Soon as manufacturers start doing direct to consumer like Tesla does, dealerships can get all that shady shit and go pound sand because they'll all be out of business, exciting times!

I'm driving in the passenger seat of a Tesla on auto drive waiting for the fire to take me.
Were you in a coma back then, or what? Who is "they" that didn't care about this?The evidence you offered that nobody cared was... an article from a major media outlet written about it. This was *all over* the news when it was relevant. The ignition switch thing started years ago. The Tesla crash was a few days ago.
Someone blows up their ford pickup and no one gives a fuck. One tesla on fire and the world‚Äôs ending. media cunts
Hm. Interesting. Texas, Citadel country, Tesla crash, smells dirty: tampering, planning, corruption. Send in the insurance guys, check those police officers.
Eyes are on Microvision lidar tech more than ever now that Tesla had an autopilot related accident
He also said the same thing about Tesla before a huge run and later changed his mind and went bull [https://youtu.be/4Ap0Et3OipA](https://youtu.be/4Ap0Et3OipA)
Just drove a tesla, now I see why that stock goes up none stop
He said the same thing about GME right before the epic squeeze:: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeC573JBu9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeC573JBu9A)  He also said the same thing about Tesla In 2017 and you should avoid the battleground : [https://youtu.be/4Ap0Et3OipA](https://youtu.be/4Ap0Et3OipA) If you did the opposite of what he said on those two battleground stocks you would be FILTHY RICH!Patterns, Patterns, Patterns.
Check box #5 - call it a battle ground stock and tell people to avoid it just like he did with GME right before the epic squeeze :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeC573JBu9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeC573JBu9A) Oh yeah, He also said the same thing about Tesla before a huge run and later changed his mind and went bull [https://youtu.be/4Ap0Et3OipA](https://youtu.be/4Ap0Et3OipA)
Hmmm.. He initially said the same thing about Tesla then a few years later ended up retracting his statements and went bull.. I can see that happening here, Don‚Äôt forget he is just a puppet, They love to try to manipulate us this way

If you're not buying Tesla on this dip I don't know what to tell ya. Of course it wasn't FSD. Car didn't even have it. Time to moon
Yessss glad I didn‚Äôt close out that call option today. The media manipulation with Tesla is insane. Anything to get clicks.
You there, come sit with us by the warmth of the tesla. Crack open a cold one and throw a kebab on the fire, you deserve it pogchamp.
Tesla earnings run starts tomorrow?
99.84% of my portfolio is in Tesla puts
From -1200 to +102 Thanks tesla Fuk pltr
Im financially ruined bc two idiots crashed a tesla?
I think everyone on WSB is going to have to mentally prepare for all growth stocks to trade sideways or dip further until the end of the year.If the indices are reaching ATH, with the FED injecting money, and covid re-recovering, and growth is still down, what the hell do you think is going to happen when indices correct/stop going up/teasury raises/biden raises taxes.seriously, growth is f'd for a long long time.prepare to be holding your nio/pltr bags at this time next year, except they will be down 70% while cheesecake factory hits 100Imagine its April 2022, your nio bags are at 25, pltr bags at 15. tesla bags at 300-400
People who miss out on good companies that sky rocket try to justify others in the market as ‚Äúlike xxx 5 years ago!‚Äù  In this case people are using BYND and Impossible as their comparison points.  It‚Äôs similar to how all these shitty EV companies saw their stock skyrocket after Tesla did.  One of my hard-learned lessons in stock trading is never chase a ‚Äúsecond place‚Äù company because it looks cheap.
tesla green tomorrow just like that time that peloton killed a child and their stock rose regardless
I‚Äôm surprised the Tesla that blew up was in Houston. You hardly see any Teslas there anyway. Meanwhile here in Austin everyone including hobos and their dogs have Teslas.
You ever see those amateur porn videos of the chick who owns a Tesla and bangs dudes in it while it‚Äôs on autopilot? Can‚Äôt be just her doing that
Everyone so convinced Tesla is gonna be red tm cuz of the news. This is why Elon is gonna show out for us an be green. Give us a sign your here Elon
For every 2 people that a Tesla kills there are 3 that it didn‚Äôt kill. That‚Äôs works out to about 1050/share, give or take a person.
Funny how this Tesla story is gaining traction but the one where the guy got trapped in his Tesla and the doors wouldn‚Äôt open while it was on fire didn‚Äôt. https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/23/man-died-burning-tesla-because-its-futuristic-doors-wouldnt-open-lawsuit-alleges/
This Tesla accident has Bobby Axelrod written all over it
I dream of a day where I can buy a Tesla with a sack of weed and a pack of shiba inus.
Idk how people keep making these bets against Tesla. I don‚Äôt agree, but props for having the balls
Long Tesla puts if you want a 50 bagger. Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you
Ya‚Äôll notice the front page? Someone just pointed it out and there‚Äôs NO GME FOR A LOT OF IT! holy shit this sub is kinda getting back. There‚Äôs was talk of Tesla, royal bank of Canada, Cramer being a fuckwit. I‚Äôve missed this.
Knowing that an asymmetric weight on the wheel tricks the hand sensor is common enough knowledge, I think. It's not even Tesla specific it can work on other cars that don't have capacitive sensing for hands.
Apparently there‚Äôs a hack. Certainly not common knowledge amongst Tesla owners
It's simply not possible without majorly interrupting safety systems. It is not a tesla problem here.
That guys lying. I own a Tesla. You have to put your hands on the wheel every 15 seconds. Also the self driving is really bad. It could maybe get you home successfully 1 out of every 5 times. FSD is purely a beta test and you‚Äôre intended to take over when you‚Äôre about to crash, which happens frequently
I believe that Tesla specifically asks for a driver in the *driver's* seat in case the self-driving system doesn't work, for this very reason&amp#x200BTSLA might still tank a bit, but I expect it to recover soon
damn tesla auto pilot cant even stay on the street.
From the article"*Tesla reports one accident for every 3.7 million miles driven while Autopilot is engaged. Over the past two years, the number of miles driven per accident, with the Autopilot on, has increased 18%. In comparison, the NHTSA reports one accident for about 475,000 miles driven for all U.S. vehicles.*"Not trying to invalidate your point. This just seemed relevant to the conversation. Personally I have no strong opinion one way or the other.
Negative news on Tesla? Be prepared to get downvoted to fucking hell. Rip to the people in the car
Fatal Tesla crash in Texas believed to be driverlessRuh roh
I appreciate the analysis, but I would love a longer term view. I been around to know how Cramer works and without any stats, I am confident you would have lost more money than you made if you followed his recommendations. His one day returns are because people dive in (or out) the moment he makes a recommendation.  That is why I find that one month performance interesting because it means that by then, folks get out from the hype and actually lose money. Also, Cramer has ‚Äúwinners‚Äù by recommending the obvious. Yeah, Tesla, Amazon, Apple etc. when they been going on an uptrend. Where was he when GME was at $3. What was he saying when the market was crashing last year? Did he say to buy before or much after the market bottomed out. Heck, he should credit WSB since many of his good recommendations are coming from you beautiful people, but he fails to give that credit. TLDR: Cramer sucks. You get better DD and advice in WSB or by yourself.
Anyone just occasionally read the comments on Yahoo Finance? I find it insane how the people there are so toxic to things like digital currency and growth stocks like Tesla. If you don't want to put money in those things that's your choice -- but to actively just hate post about younger people making money off growth and digital is just an awful way to live a life.
Thanks for the laughs. And the stonk tips.See you at the Tesla demolition derby in space tards.
I‚Äôd pay 1million......     Tesla shares
Cathie selling tesla is extremely bullish because now, as is tradition, she will be buying back in at a higher price within the next few months.
"A 1K bet on doggy at start of 2021 could now buy a tesla"OK gimme the rope
And this is why I got on edge when they recommended Tesla a few days ago. I don't trust them at all and any time they talk about stocks I own part of me just wants to sell them.
Then I won't be buying a Tesla.
Daily GME megathread closing means wsb daily megathread will come GME and people will focus on GME instead of spy, Tesla,etc. BuuuulishüìàüöÄ

Maybe the tendies are the friendships we made on this journey! Na I‚Äôm kidding see y‚Äôall on the moon I‚Äôm finna buy a Tesla
Everybody‚Äôs hyping Apple &amp Tesla so I already know what‚Äôs going to happen tomorrow &amp Monday
Now more than ever need a Tesla miracle AH or in premarket tomorrow. Honestly, what‚Äôs happened to the EV market? EV bulls fucked for the year or what?
Bubbles don't have to pop - the book value might eventually adjust to the sale price. Tesla has been overvalued for awhile now, but I don't ever think it's gonna go down to where it should be.
Tesla has to go up 20% or I‚Äôm gonna be working behind the dumpster at Wendy‚Äôs
Fuck anyone who sold Tesla for Coinbase
I'm officially out for 90 days after being really stupid yesterday and taking 30k to 15k by FUD around tesla and constantly paperhanding stuff and switching calls/puts.I am actually going to a therapist about my trading because it got so bad this last month.  Scheduled for 2 weeks from now.I was up bigly (over 100k - I managed to be someone who had bought GME below 30).  Made money on PLUG, AAL, CCIV, apha, sndl (all the things.)Then I bought into some other meme stocks (sndl, zom, ocgn, pltr) and this last month had me feeling like I needed to "make it back".I had originally just made patient plays starting last March and that the reason I was up at all. Got lucky on some stuff but didn't fuck with day trades.This last month I epically fucked myself feeling like I had to get back what I lost.  It became an addiction.  Constantly on Ameritrade, wsb, reading news around my stocks.  Not working, feeling sick, not eating, not working out, not spending time productive or relaxing at all.As soon as insaw any red in my portfolio I'd freak out feeling like "oh no I have to fix that." Even though there was no emergency.  The worst part is I effectively had 2 stupid days where if I had done nothing I still would have been green on the week. But between just those two days I day traded myself to 40k losses.  I consistently chose fear and emotion over the plan I had set out and couldn't control myself.I constantly feel like I have to fix it and the only way to fix it is to trade. It was really fucking with all aspects of my life.  I'd be happy some days, and completely void of emotion others.  Since I began trading I'm now down 10k overall.  Hopefully I can work through my shit- this has been all I do every day for months now.  Stare at the chart.  Get emotional. Have no desire to do anything else.  Make bad emotional decisions after making good logical ones only to erase all gains made over weeks in a matter of minutes.I consider myself lucky I didn't use the margin available and really fuck myself.  -10k suck, but I know others are worse off.Maybe I'll never return to trading but I'll keep lurking and commenting.  I love this community, even the gay bears, for all the simultaneous support and shifting on people like me fir their terrible decisions.
tesla has the most textbook bubble formation with a double top and a fake breakout in the daily chart. I'm not saying it is, but you have to be crazy to put money in there right now
While we wait...Apes, I want to hear answers to two questions from you (1) What is the first thing you'll do with your tendies? (2) What charity are you going to support.My answers: I'll pay off my house and buy a tesla roadster AND i'l support either educating orphaned Children  or to Children with Autism.

Price forecasts also have Tesla at 300 and 1400. If you throw enough shit at a wall some of it is bound to stick
Tesla went from 800 to 550 literally last month lol
I remember looking at Tesla go from like 50 bucks up to 60 and thinking ‚Äúwell that was a good run‚Äù and then had a year to buy in while it was still going up like hundreds of % and then thought ‚Äúwell 800 is a pretty good entry‚Äù and now here we are
If Tesla hits 800 eow I‚Äôll drink my piss
Would give a nut for Tesla to open at 780
Let's hope Tesla opens at 780+ I will suck elons üÖøÔ∏èüÖøÔ∏è
Everyone talks about buying new lambos or Tesla. But if we‚Äôre going to the moon and beyond, I‚Äôm gonna need a Lunar rover
I too am bullish on Coin. I trade/buy crypto and use coinbase pro all the time. I see it as the Tesla of crypto. It's clearly the leader for an exchange. I use others as well but coinbase leads the pack for sure. Bought a couple today @395. I could be fucked but I do think it will be a valuable stock. The FD's are pretty great. Thx for the post! If it dips I'll buy more.
Tesla is gonna rip tomorrow. 800 Friday
Futes looking nice. I wanna see you gape up Tesla. 800 EOD
All of you are truly apes - you know Cathie sold Tesla to balance her ARKK ETF Tesla position back to around 10% right? She has been buying the dips for months so because it shot up in price yesterday, the % holdings of Tesla in ARKK increased well over 10%... she sold to rebalance, it‚Äôs not some crazy statement by her about TeslaAs to COIN, no clue what her plan is haha
If crypto continues to be a thing, people will buy it through ETFs or other services brokered by big investments banks.  This is much more understandable than explaining what a wallet is, and if you lose your code it's gone forever.  Coinbase will do fine, but it's margins will be undercut and it'll be a niche player.That being said, it could be an emotional stock like Tesla, so metrics don't matyer.
Win powerball, yolo it all on Tesla calls, lose it all, start fresh Friday.
Tesla please go back up...
Tesla please go back to $780 tomorrow
You miss it because back then, Tesla might have been the king, but there were still other stocks and variety. Now a days? Just GME and crapto
That's right Tesla, you get your lying ass back up there for tomorrow's flight
Feels like just yesterday Tesla was above $760.
Hell yeah bought at the top for GME AND COIN (even though I just panic bought 1 coin) cant wait for the nice breeze on my face otw down.Realistically though do you think we can see amazon or tesla price per share?
Serious question... Tesla Roadster, 718 Spyder, Lexus LC500, or Lambo Huruc√°n?
CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES THIS IS MY LAST RESORT *all in‚Äôs tesla*
guys tesla is up about 2 bucks AH that means we only need 48 more to get back to where we were at the beginning of the day
I guess this is how I died, was 20K profit when the day started now -12K almost out of money and time to jump of the bridge, can‚Äôt believe SQ and Tesla calls will do this too meü§Ø
I told myself I was just gonna watch and then FOMO‚Äôd in at $415 and $420. I‚Äôm able to feel a little better about it because I bought in with money from selling a Tesla option at a $100 loss that would have lost me just much as much (or more) than COIN had I just held it instead.
Tesla 800 eow still or 600? Find out next time...on Elon musks Twitter!

I sold my Tesla position, which began in 2019, today to get more GME. I BELIEVE AND KNOW THIS WAS THE RIGHT MOVE
Tesla shaving years off my life right now.
Tesla will finish the day delisted
Tesla cares about the environment, it just went green.
If GME hits 350 by end of the month, I‚Äôll pay a hooker to read me transformers comic books in the back of a Tesla while I wear a Batman onesie.  I reserve the right to take a nap during said readings.

Just left the gas station... Attendant: "Come again!"Me: "You too..."That's how fucking retarded I am. Tesla 900 by earnings
I really think i should sell... my Tesla Stocks to put even more in GME. I like how red days are now just meh after i sat through 400-40. really I didnt even care if the stock was falling and green days are incredible fun. This whole experience has changed me for the better
Tesla 780 eod
Upvote if you‚Äôre being abused by Tesla
Literally more profitable in Q1 2021 than tesla in all of 2020, 100B is nothing
Can TESLA be geeen today???
TESLA and COIN üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Robinhood is recommending I pull out of GME and switch to Apple or Tesla. They say they are less volatile. If GME is volatile, it is so in the same way as Chris Farley: he is crazy awesome!
GME DONE BEEN THROUGH A WHOLE LOT, TRIALS TRIBULATIONS BUT I KNOW STOCKS  HEDGE FUNDS WANNA PUT US IN A BOW TIE, PRAY THAT THE APE FUNDS DONT GO DRY (YEAHIE YEAHIE)AS I LOOK AROUND ME, SO MANY FUD-FERFUCKERS WANNA DOUBT GMEBUT ROARING KITTY WOULD NEVER DROWN ME, IN FRONT OF A CHOME TESLA MODEL X THE FOUND ME AND I LIKE THE STOCK
I‚Äôm a simple man, all I want is for the stock to hit $20,000 per share so I can buy a home in LA and NY with a Tesla for each one. Is that too much to ask?

It‚Äôs crazy that we have a community 160k strong who value this stock at least at $180 and our valuation of the company literally means nothing to big fund who think they know better.

News release: GameStop corporation acquired by amazon in partnership with Tesla motors..... stock stays flat after 10 billion shares are shorted.AmeriKa!
Buy Tesla calls- this is a Financial advise
I am 487 days sober and for the first time in the last 487 days I feel that... fucked up like.. empty feeling... the void. You know what I‚Äôm talking about? Someone tell me something nice about Tesla. Tell me my calls are pretty.
Imagine seeing a company called Nikola motors and thinking "yeah this is totally not a scam riding off the success of Tesla lets throw 5 billion dollars at it".
Tesla $720 tomorrow
I think one thing we now know for certain is that GME's gamma/short mutant squeeze will be a more protracted event and that the MOASS won't suddenly happen in one day. Instead, GME will probably take several months to eventually grow to well above $1,000, probably with a stock split and small offering along the way, similar to Tesla.
They should do a stock split soon. It helped tesla, and I am convinced a lot of haters and regular retail simply can't afford $180 shares, thus the weird amc copy.Think volume would skyrocket
Sold Tesla buy more GME !!Too the moon ape
Honestly don‚Äôt get the Lambo thing...Grew out of super cars in my teens. I‚Äôll have a Tesla and maybe a Range Rover for the winter months.
It seems they close some positions on tesla to fight with usüòÇ
God plz join the fun tm Tesla
I have a confession to make boys, I don't actually own any stocks or have a brokerage account. In fact Ive been living off the grid in the woods since 2012 and I shave with a machete. I don't even know what a "tesla" is.Sent from my galaxy s3
Imagine ignoring the obvious conversations ‚Äúshe‚Äù and her husband ‚Äúfund manager‚Äù would have.. ‚ÄúHey babe, in a few months we will pass a ev infrastructure bill‚Äù ‚Äúok I‚Äôll buy Tesla 500 calls and make a perfect bull spread‚Äù If that conversation didn‚Äôt happen then ‚Äúhe‚Äù has a crystal ball
Tesla is not a good inflation play.  The infrastructure bill, like the recent stimulus bill, is long on pork and short on help and improvements.  Eating might be a bigger concern than investing in 4 years.  Pray we survive better than CA, NY, or Chicago under this same idiotic leadership.
Anyone else sick of politicians pouring millions of dollars into stocks, just to days later announce legislation or plans that directly benefit the exact stocks they invested in? Like when pelosi dumped over a million dollars into tesla 3 days before biden announced they were switching the USPS fleet to electric vehicles
Why‚Äôs Tesla being such a cunt lately
I got a raise today. More tendies to throw at Tesla :)
It's Tesla, just wait a day. Maybe Papa Elon will tweet about a fart and it'll blow up in the morning. Who knows.
Excellent analysis, and not just because it confirms my bias. I appreciate the work that went into the analysis itself and also the simple and effective presentation. I might just go buy some more. It feels like a lot of people have already made up in their minds that Tesla is going to be "it" and there won't be room for others on the EV scene. In reality there is so much going on. Crazy.
I live in the deep south and am friends with a lot of the new generation of redneck zoomers, the kind that drive lifted F150s but still know Tesla and might be willing to consider electric. I showed one of them the Cybertruck already, and when I recently showed him the Endurance he said "That damn liberal truck you showed me before was ugly as hell, but that thing ain't half bad."For me that was enough to know, if Lordstown builds it, they will come.
I hate red days bc that gives bears hope. You don‚Äôt hear from them until a day like today. They say ‚Äúfubo to teens‚Äù ‚Äútesla is overvalued‚Äù ‚Äúputs will printtttt‚Äù FUCK EM we gon keep buying calls and eat that shit up alllll day baaaa bitch
Tesla hitting a more reasonable P/E ratio today of 1084
Tesla to $600 or $750 tomorrow.
That's your call man. Just remember where things would be now if people stayed away from [Tesla based off SEC charges](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226)
Look at the rest of the news for $RIDE and you'll see about 1000 more copy-pasted ambulance chasers trying to start up a suit. I'm not saying lawsuits mean nothing, but companies get sued like this all the time, even Tesla still deals with this. That doesn't make the allegations more valid.
Thanks tesla. Im now homeless, jobless, hungry, thirsty, and worst of all, turning into a fggt ber
selling my tesla call for a loss so it can go up right after. thank me later guys
Lmao should I design my tesla now and just leave it in my cart for squoze?
Unpopular opinion:  if Tesla offered a normal-ass looking truck alongside the Cybertruck they'd get a lot more market share

I've never seen a tesla or a Lamborghini in my small sleepy college town, now suddenly I've seen 2 Teslas and a Lambo. All 3 were College kids. Which one of you retarded idahoans yolod your student loan money and hit a monster bagger?

As a project engineer that installs mass production lines for new facilities, I 100% know that their production lines are good to go. They‚Äôll be ready by September, the Betas proved it.Think logically about why LMC is a great company to invest in, look at all the facts: 1. They already have a massive production facility2. 650M cash on hand 3 GM-Backed company. GM needs them.4. Current ‚Äúlawsuits‚Äù won‚Äôt have ground to stand on. 5. They‚Äôre building a f‚Äôing truck for fleets , there‚Äôs so much demand for those. 6. Actual experienced management team with execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, Honda, etc.7. Betas are rolling off the assembly lines and being welded by robots8. New innovative Hub-Motors incorporated into their Vehicles. Tech that other big car manufacturers will want later on but can‚Äôt obtain because LMC already licensed it. This might change how EVs are built, and LMC will be the first ones to do it. 9. When someone tries to scare you and mentions the ‚Äúunsprung weight‚Äù the motors might add on, tell them to chill because 100% they don‚Äôt even know what that means. There‚Äôs ways around it. You know how much a conventional motor adds to the vehicle ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and how cars are literally engineered around it. Same thing will go with the hub-motors. Actually, the weight distribution will be better in Hub-Motors because all four wheels will have equal weights on them. Your center of gravity will be truly center to the vehicle. 10. Supply Chain issues are probably going to be solved by GM. 11. They partnered with Camping World, and collaborated to build an RV for them, that‚Äôs huge. 12. Their skateboard chassis is interchangeable and can fit any body they put on it with little-to-no modifications. Hence retooling costs will be extremely cheap. Which means you don‚Äôt have to constantly keep changing production line setups.
Hyped for Tesla tm let‚Äôs fucking go
**Also, as I mentioned in my post, here is a $TSLA example on how Wall Street capitalizes on FUD from SEC involvement:**In the summer of 2019, a ‚Äúhighly regarded‚Äù analyst at Morgan Stanley named Adam Jonas came out with a (pre-split) [worst-case price target of $10 for Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html). This was right around the time Tesla was being looked at by the SEC.When the news of this broke, one of my friends I roomed with in college told me he made the decision to sell the stock. He was new to the market, and he was worried he was going to lose all of his money on this investment. I‚Äôm sure many other retail investors made the same decision to sell as Wall Street succeeded by inducing fear into $TSLA investors.**A year and a half later, how much $TSLA does Morgan Stanley own?**[Morgan Stanley now owns over 3.5 million shares of Tesla which equates to over $2.5 Billion dollars](https://fintel.io/so/us/tsla/morgan-stanley). And guess what? That same Morgan Stanley analyst, [Adam Jonas, now has a Wall-Street high price target of $810](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/05/morgan-stanleys-adam-jonas-raises-tesla-price-target-to-a-wall-street-high-of-810.html) (which would equate to over $4,000 before the stock split).Must be nice ‚Äì lower your price target to scare retail investors, load up on the stock when the price drops, and then increase your price target to drive the stock way up. Wall Street does this all the time, and this is the reason we despise these crooks.

You have over 1.5mil in tesla shares, and you think the appropriate answer you'll get is from WSB?
RIP Tesla FDs
To everyone saying why Tesla is not mooningIt‚Äôs cause biden wants union labor or at least union pay.Elon would rather drink blended feces than do that.
Tesla is gonna fuckin pop tomorrow
Just fucking say Tesla sleepy joe!

I can‚Äôt believe I bought Tesla puts at literally the bottom below $600
One day we'll wake up and see a tweet from Ryan Cohen announcing a partnership with Tesla and you can buy Tesla's at your local GameStop
After this is over it's going to be so boring on the moon betting on boomer stocks like tesla
Tesla going to $850 tomorrow
Tesla to $700 eod
Tesla seriously about to blow up some shorts tomorrow. I see a 20% day to 800
Tesla to 1000 tomorrow
I guess Tesla to $1000 after quarterly deliveries
Tesla pleaseeeee i need a new desk chair
Confirmation bias achieved &gt	Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) will beat Wall Street expectations of 170,000 deliveries for the first quarter and restore momentum for the company‚Äôs stock and electric vehicle sector, according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.
I think we inevitably rotate back into growth and tech, perhaps starting as soon as Thursday. Lots of names on the cheap imo, PLTR, Tesla included. PLTR will surprise https://youtu.be/6VTKtJN-e24
Tesla gonna hit 730 tomorrow and buy me a new girlfriend
Nothing like watching bears lose their lunch money on Tesla. Feels like the old days.
Man I'm so happy I had to work today, would have blown my last 500 on a tesla put
When I sell one one millionth of my GME share for a Tesla that‚Äôll be a cool day
Nice. Take out a massive loan and do Tesla weeklies
Friend: wanna go to Casino?Me: nah I don‚Äôt betTesla 700c 4/30
Bro. I had 50 shares at $25 on the initial jump up. I was hurting for so long... I‚Äôm glad I liquidated at $18 and threw the rest on Tesla puts, was able to make all my money back
Who would actually buy blackberry, when you could just lose everything on Tesla
Can Tesla go up 400 dollars plz
It's fun watching rich people cry but I bought this stock under the assumption that it would go up but could crash. Literally same reason I bought tesla ***LOL***
Go GME GO !!!!!!!DADDY NEEDS TO BUY HIS FIRST TESLA!!!!!!!!!!
I know we've all become numb to the price movement of GME but try to recognize how HUGE of a day +8-9% is. Imagine if Apple, tesla, etc. had a +8% day. The media would talk about nothing else
Tesla literally bull traps daily at 11:30
I've been looking at houses way over my current budget and designed the exact Tesla I want. I know how much I need to give my parents and brother in order for them to retire. I want my wife to never have to work again (if she doesn't want to).This isn't just about us. It's about our family and friends that we want to help out. This is for everyone who got fcked in 2008. This is for the all the apes who HODL.
Looking at my fortpolio... Tesla blows, Rocket blows, Big Pharma blows... and my GME drives my overall earnings every which way daily. Dang I love this stonk
Hate being down so much that you‚Äôre almost forced to diamond hand. Fucking Tesla puts I should have closed this morning and now my butt is whistling when I walk
Sold my Tesla calls and bought puts at open ü§°
I'm expecting the catalyst to be a confirmation of a joint venture between Tesla and Gamestop to create the first known Dyson Sphere by the year 3000. This will cause the valuation of both companies to dwarf all others, as the potential gains to be had by limitless energy are just that, limitless.
Are the wheel upgrades worth it on a Tesla or no?
JPOW bring out the printer. Biden bring out the Infrastructure bill. Tesla bring out the Level 5 AI confirmed.We have bears to kill
GameStop is going to be the next Apple, Microsoft, Disney and Tesla combined.
The more gme moons the more I think of Cathie Woods pretty feet, long toes, and oh so sweaty soles.  Hard working gal like herself got feet that smell like money and the inside of a tesla.
I just read someone's due diligence that blackrock was the one behind many of those stocks dropping, Discovery, Paramount's company, etc. It seems that blackrock has a bone to pick with citadel stemming back to last year on Tesla when blackrock lost a bunch of money due to citadel's manipulation of Tesla stock apparently. So by the Black Rock reducing their positions in all the stocks that drop, citadel was one of the main holders of those shares, it pushed citadel closer to a margin call.Again this is all speculation, and only one or two different due diligence reports that I have read. If it's true, cool. If not, oh well.
If tesla cant hold $600 it's gonna get ugly real fast.
Tesla üöÄüöÄüöÄsoon
Sometimes when I sit on my porch I worry that Tesla on autopilot is going to drive straight into my house and kill me.
Holy shit. Tesla double charged customers so report twice the amount of cars sold. Big if true.
Shit PLTR bagholders say:  ‚Äúbuy the dip!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI cant believe how undervalued this stonk is right now‚Äù, ‚Äúa nice head and shoulders pattern is developing on the chart‚Äù, ‚Äújust wait until demo day and we knoxk it out the park‚Äù, ‚Äúamazon and tesla took awhile to get running too‚Äù, ‚Äúaveraged down today, feeeels good man‚Äù, ‚Äúhow do people seriously not buy at these prices?‚Äù, ‚Äúthe bottom is in, we are holding strong at these levels(then blasts deeper in 15 mins lol)‚Äù........Clowns ü§°
  **Volkswagen to kill Tesla with 'Voltswagen of America'** *Sounds like Volkswagen is fixated to put Tesla in its electric coffin. So much so they even changed their name to VOLTswagen!*Volkswagen will reportedly rebrand its US operation to 'Voltswagen of America'All signs point to Volkswagen changing the name of its stateside operation to "Voltswagen of America," according to [*CNBC*](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/vw-accidentally-leaks-new-name-for-its-us-operations-voltswagen.html). Earlier today, the automaker prematurely published an incomplete press release to its website it planned to share on April 29th. VW quickly took down the announcement, but not before *CNBC* managed to get a good look at it.A Volkswagen spokesperson declined to comment on the release, but a source "familiar with the company's plans" told the network the document was authentic. The release characterized the rebranding as a "public declaration of the company's future-forward investment in e-mobility." The change will reportedly see Volkswagen EVs feature a badge that bears the new Voltswagen branding and a lighter blue VW logo. Any gas-powered cars the company sells moving forward will feature only the classic VW emblem in the automaker's signature dark blue color.Traditional automakers have been all about EV-centric rebrandings in recent months. In January, GM [redid its classic logo](https://www.engadget.com/gm-logo-branding-electric-vehicles-210607845.html) to evoke "the clean skies of a zero-emissions future." The new design is also a visual play on the company's [Ultium battery technology](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-04-gm-ultium-ev-batteries.html). For Volkswagen, the change would come at a pivotal point in its history. The company plans to offer [300 EV models by 2030](https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-11-volkswagen-wants-300-ev-models-by-2030.html) and get to a point where at least 60 percent of the cars it sells in Europe are either hybrids or battery electrics.*Ask Papi Elon to stop fucking around with his banana rocket, it's time to buckle up or Tesla will tank south to $69?*
Just sold my moms tesla share for some GME, she said she likes the stock
i just want a tesla cybertruck
Dear Tesla, I wrote you but you still ain‚Äôt callin.
This is fine I have plenty of time to decide what color Tesla imma snag post-moon
Cathie should liquidate her Tesla position or she risks becoming one of the most legendary bagholders of all time
Selling tesla at 900 was probably the best decision of my life
I imagine Cathy in her thongs at night with her titties out. That usually let me forgive her 3k Tesla price target
I know this is unpopular rn but I really miss the pre GME WSB manWhen we‚Äôd play tankers and Tesla
Lambos are cool but who here is getting a Tesla
Tesla back to 666, satan confirmed
Last year I got as low as -85% in my portfolio but I told myself I wasn‚Äôt out of the game yet. After massive moves like TSLA, NIO, GME, and others I‚Äôm finally taking delivery of a Tesla this weekend, which is why I started this whole game to begin with. Couldn‚Äôt have done it without my WSB fam üöÄ
**Lord what if the correction does start now.**You're uneducated really and you've just gotten your stimulus check. You've heard all year about Tesla from your buddy who now drives one and rubs it in your face. He's telling you."Buy the dip bro. They're just shaking the üìÉ üßª ‚úã out".So you put your stimulus and a chunk of your life savings into the market. You feel good financially for the first time in a year. You're financially secure again, employed, and feeling good.*1 day later*Robinhood sends you a notification on your phone. Tesla is down 5% today. Your eyes flutter with panic and you scramble to open your brokerage app. Tesla is actually down 8% today. Oh well rough first day.*Next day*You get another notification. Tesla down 10%. S&ampP drops 4%. You've  begun to panic a little bit now. 18% of your life savings evaporated.Your buddy kept telling you about this options thing. So you decide to fight back. Your buddy encourages you."Bro the yields man, its all bullshit just buy the dip".So you buy the dip. You convert a substantial amount of your shares into options and you're ready for the bounce.SPX finishes the month down 10%. NDX 16%. Your portfolio is down 80% from its recent peak. You've now capitulated and sworn off trading forever. The tears flowing from your face as you close your Robinhood app for the first time. You're üë™ tries to comfort you, but they're now having to eat ramen noodles nightly because you've blown your cushion. Your wife‚Äôs boyfriend now is offering to buy groceries. It was a cold night year's later. You wrote a letter saying goodbye to your friends and now distant family. You lost your wife, boyfriend, and kids after you revenge traded the mortgage on GME. The üåà üêª and hedge funds stuck a dagger in your heart that could never heal. The rope was tight enough, maybe it would hold this time.You open your Robinhood app just to check. Tesla is at 20,000. You should have just bought shares and never looked at it.Your buddy texts you "Bro did you buy the dip?"
Damn imagine if the apes just bought tesla calls like normal. Tesla is on sale people.
I‚Äôm so retarded I only wear velcro shoes, but anyway Tesla 900
I love the fear today. As Warren Buffet always said, be brave when others are fearful and show off your giant wang with EOW Tesla FD calls!
Watch GME, and hope Tesla goes up ü•¥
Tesla do that thing where you go up $120 in one day please
I NEED THIS TO SQUEEZE I WANT MY FUCKING TESLA CYBERTRUCK
2040 Tesla earnings already priced in.
Do any Tesla holders worry about Elon‚Äôs mental state? Like the fact that if he wasn‚Äôt a billionaire genius you‚Äôd be like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with that moron?‚Äù Or is that an asset when evaluating Tesla
Puts on my Tesla calls
...said the techno king of Tesla.
Hi my name is Elon Tesla and instead of running my car company I'm talking about stupid dog money.
Tesla cucked me harder than GME, meme stock is more reliable than good ol Tesla. What a time to be an ape
Technoking of Tesla\*
Memes aside, is Tesla actually dead? Lol
Come on fucks, we break 220 by close and I'm pulling the trigger on my tesla!
Just hang tight until June 18. That‚Äôs when my Tesla calls expire and $6000 vanishes. After that the bull market will resume
Oh well, guess I‚Äôm going down with the Tesla ship.
Bought tesla at 900 post split. HATING EVERY MINUTE OF LIFE FOR THE PAST 3 MONTHS
Tesla. Just go. The fuck. Back up.
Holy fuck i hate tesla right now.
Do you guys think Hf managers are making stock bets over on the other side like we are? I see it now Gabe: ‚Äú if we get the stock below 150$ I‚Äôll short Tesla while eating purple crayons.‚Äù
Past hour, similar price movements tesla does right before blast offI do my ta using RH charts
Reading trends might work for stable normal stocks, even though I still don‚Äôt think they tell you shit, but for GEE EM EE they tell you nothing. What you can tell is how well the stock will do by the positivity in this sub. The times this sub has been super positive, the stonk rocketed, the times this sub gets negative and mean, the stonk falls. WHAT DOES THIS TELL US? we are sensitive apes and respond to positive reinforcement. If you see a negative comment, downvote AND post a positive one. I‚Äôm a teacher, I make a decent wage in Scotland and live comfortably, but god damn I want a Tesla.  Love you apes ü¶ç
Dude it‚Äôs still Tesla. PE ratio of like 1100 still. I‚Äôm a tech bull but Tesla is driven by hype for that valuation
I really want one of those cats with the smushed in faces so I need Tesla to do something this week.
Buy PLTR. It‚Äôs a Tesla situation. Hype has died, but when people actually understand what they do and how valuable their software is, ppl will pile in hard. I bought Tesla sub 200 pre split. Innovative value plays only. I went big on Palantir and will continue to buy. In Peter thiels book he mentioned that he was working in a business that will monopolize an entire industry that doesn‚Äôt exist yet. The business was Palantir. The industry was telling the future with simulations. No competition. They are completely industry agnostic and applicable to all business. They even saved BP over a billion dollars for a cost of less than 100 mill. That is value in software.
Bought Tesla Tequila. Sell empty bottle, buy more stocks.
I forgot to say earlier that I followed a Tesla in traffic today, I'm absolutely sure this was a sign from the the great ape lord himself that GME will indeed bring me my Tesla. It's impossible to be anything else
Nikola is such a shit name for a company that aims to compete with Tesla. It's like they're willingly turning themselves into a meme. It's as if, from the get-go, they gladly accepted their status as an off-brand Tesla.
You guys say Michael Burry is a God but he shorted Tesla around $400 last year before they joined the S&ampP. Imagine the short interest he‚Äôs paying on that.How many gorillas that money could have saved.He also dumped GameStop at $17 after getting in around $10.
Are Tesla üåàüêªs dead yet?
BREAKING: Elon to move Tesla HQ to Oregon so that he can feed all his factory employees shrooms and, quote, "just see what happens"
$210 - I'm selling Tesla and buying this dip!
Tesla coming your way soon my boy
https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cost-breakdown-buying-guide-2021-3?ampIt‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre expecting a bunch of dirty apes to come into some money soon or something.
Elon there is a tesla T on the GME chart. Do it now!
Breaking news: Tesla announces that Chief Executive Elon Musk has changed his title at the company to ‚ÄúTechnoking of Tesla.‚Äù  This is a real headline. And it is sofa king amazing.
Would love for Tesla to open up greener then shreks cock tomorrow
Rotation to tech. Tesla $800 EOD
 TESLA!!!!!
As a Tesla owner, this is the kind of Tesla owner I want to slap.
Hold my gme shares ofc.My predictions for upcoming weeks:Cohen announces phat dividends. Tesla announces new gaming system. Gme buys valve.Might put like $600 into bb
I‚Äôve ran out of free money to invest in anything new so I‚Äôm just gonna keep holding my Tesla, Apple, Tui and GME shares and see what it brings
It hasn‚Äôt though. You‚Äôre just experiencing your first meme stock. PRPL used to be every post, SPCE too, you‚Äôd see a ton of Tesla. When a stock is constantly killing it, everyone here posts about it. When no stocks are killing it, you see the random stocks people made a killing on.
How are my Tesla and Apple calls looking for tomorrow? Asking for my landlord..
It's the anniversary of my friends and family convincing me I should sell my Tesla pre split $600 leap calls. "Economy is going down/virus/tsla was a bubble that popped and will never recover, etc" even wsb was shouting Tesla to $90 when it fell below $400 again. Would have made $10 million in about 6 months. Never listened to any of them or even retards here again. F in the chat for me please
GME next week to:below $4000 - keep holding my shares$4000 - I'll quit my job and retire$6000 - buy a penthouse apartment and a ferrari $8000 - Tesla and a Lambo$10000+ - drink for a week and do cocaine, might get a cat.
OK Biden buck bois, I need you to pump all your meme shit in the AM with your bread and circus money.Especially Tesla.  Please get TSLA back to 800+.
Tesla was my first true love but GameStop is making me consider leaving my wife for her boyfriend
Tesla go to 700 you betch
It‚Äôs 2025. You go to gamestop to pick up the new Nvidia cards, exclusively sold by gamestop. While you are there, you pick up a pok√©mon deck and notice there is a tournament going on in the adjacent arena. You use your powerup rewards membership card to gain access  and spectate. The card game is cool but when you put the GME VR headset on, the game comes to life! The winner takes home 5 (redacted digital currency units). You are getting hungry so you hit the kiosk on the way out and order nuggets from wendy‚Äôs to be delivered at your house, perfectly timing it so they arrive hot but after you park your tesla in your bay. license plate? APE STRNG
The man that bought Tesla at two dollars says to buy GME
I want a Tesla Model S so bad now
But but... Vagina_Destroyer420 said Tesla was going to go up today üò≠
Lets get Tesla up there
Why do people buy dumb companies like Tesla or Apple?  Those companies don't even double most weeks.
yeah so i‚Äôm gonna need tesla to go up like $100 in the next 2 hrs
mad how Apple, Tesla, and Amazon all look the same for today... makes you wonder...&amp#x200BBuy and hodl you stupid apes
With my stimulus money I could buy tires for my civicOr I could buy 2 shares and buy a Tesla in 15 days

Would it be optimistic to test drive a tesla now? ü•¥
**OH MY GOD ITS TESLA WITH THE STEEL CHAIR !!**
And then when nobody will expect it, Tesla will announce a partnership with gme
Might just sell my Tesla stocks for a $200 loss and throw it at GME rn...... would be averaging up but whatever.
Tesla $735 tomorrow.
Is tomorrow a tesla type day or a gme type say?
tesla is going up because i bought tesla calls and i don't want to believe otherwise

If tesla doesnt hit 750 tmrw I lose about 5k and that makes me feel less happy then actually making money but not less happy than not losing moneyYa feel?
I definitely have an unhealthy addiction to trading Tesla. I barely be looking at other companies lol
Nio/Tesla tomorrow?
Felt like gambling and bought a $720 Tesla call exp tomorrow. These 0dte‚Äôs seldom ever workout for me but I never learn.

Tesla pls go up bigly tomorrow
Tesla needs one of those 100 bucks days
If Biden mentions Tesla by name tonight I will personally find a cure for Alzheimers
Lol a million Tesla shares dumped at 3:59 to drag the price below 700. Tomorrow is going to be a wild day.
Tesla $800 EOW

To all the Melvin shills: you should find new employment before you lose your trust fund in this play and your daddy has to sale his new tesla (hypocrite) to bail you out
TESLA PLZ, Theta is coming for me
Tesla please
TESLA break 700 or dads gonna be mad
Elon, I work for a marketing agency. Like the stock market, marketing ROI‚Äôs are nothing, fairy dust in the wind, a fugazzi. I watch brands drop MILLIONS and MILLIONS on retarded ad campaigns that do little to increase consumer awareness or sales. If Elon publicly dropped 20mil into GME, you best believe all of us retards would NEVER let Tesla fail, AND we‚Äôd all use our tendies to buy Tesla‚Äôs. Now that‚Äôs effective marketing!
I broke two rules of mine yesterday by buying a $400 FD as a revenge trade for my Tesla losses. It‚Äôs either sink or swim at this point. Pray for me.
Tesla pleaseüòÆ $700
Tesla $800 eod

Tesla 720 pls
Guess I'm gonna get some Roblox, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and bit more AMC.I bought plenty of GME and can't afford more but I do want to invest in other stocks every paycheck.
A lot of new retail shorts entered the game. Today when the price dropped i saw at least 1000 messages on yahoo finance board. All the shorts where screaming. When price goes up they are silent, but when the price drops couple % they start screaming. We need to learn these guys a lesson. I'm planning to sell 30 Tesla shares and couple Amazon to buy more GME tomorrow. We have a long way to go and i know every investment now is a big profit over couple weeks. I never saw a community like GME. We are like 50 stock communities in one. If we jump the world will shake you will see earthquakes and tsunami everywhere. Thats with how many we are. If we hold together and buy more together nobody will able to stop us. But we need to remove our stop loss limits. Hedge funds are aiming on stop loss limits and when they hit these limits all these shares of the paperhands pussies enters the market. When pussies see this orders they panic and start to sell for lower price. Thats what happend today. I went to the garden to smoke a cigarette when i saw the drop and drink a cup of coffee. Came back was around $180 saw chaos on yahoo finance i laughed made another coffee made a short flight with flight simulator 2020 when i came back it was over 250 again. My mentality is if i die i die like a man. If it goes up nice if it stays here nice and if it goes down i buy more and more every month. First time Robinhood and hedge funds together tried to fuck us and they are warned. We took some scars and are still alive. This time nobody will be able to stop us. Together with hedge funds a lot of little retail shorters will be squeezed. There is no way back we kill or we die. One of us must die.
Roblox is the future, the next tesla
I‚Äôm the kind of retard that has Tesla as the safest stock in my portfolio so this drop doesn‚Äôt scare me!
Big day for Tesla tomorrow, I can feel it in my ass

Tesla cult is strong on Reddit. If only Elon would offer them free seats on a one-way rocketship to explore the Sun's surface...
This is why every night I put a crazy low bid buy order in on Tesla, I hit it twice once for a $50 drop and another at $45 then sold in the morning for a couple hundred profit
I actually did just that today. Cashed out some Tesla to buy that sweet dip
They going after tesla. No news here. Every single chance they get they have to throw the name out. Even investor pages on IG have generic trading tips and they all use the tesla logo in a negative way. We all know why. To the moon, mars and kepler 22b and all the other keplers!!!!!!
Performed better than Tesla.
Told my kids put all their college fund in GME.  They can now go to college with hedges kids.  And drive their tesla.
Ppl asking dumb questions: Welcome. Now stop. Go read and do some DD (due diligence) and learn about why this is just getting started. For now, hold. But direct your technical questions to the search bar and change your mindset. Don't ask where the moon is. Ask if you're prepared to accept the fact that you will soon be driving a 2021 Tesla Model X. Mentally prepare for what life is going to feel like when you don't have to be a slave to your shitty job/boss anymore. Feel the sun on your face as your future self basks in the success of starting a business, feeding the poor, spreading financial literacy, and just fucking chillin without worry. Cheers
roblox at $69.  tesla at $669.  gme at $269.  coincidence?
Chats moving so fast they won‚Äôt see **i sold my longest held boi tesla to double down**
#DOUBLING DOWN LIKE DFV üçå#YOU‚ÄôVE PISSED ME OFF NOW. I SOLD TESLA. And I love my boi tesla
Stock is up 2% today? What is this? Fucking Tesla?
Just sold all my tesla for gme, perfect opportunity to make it all back!
They saw stop loss limits around $300 and shorted a lot of shares in seconds to push the price down and hit the stop loss limits. After that a lot of shares of paperhand pussies with stop loss limits entered the market. Otherwise the short attack had no effect on us. But we are still here and are bouncing back. I will not be surprised if we end the day around $350. This kind of attacks are nothing new and are to bring panic in the market and hit the stop loss limits. I saw couple times attack like this on Tesla. But at the end all these short attacking hedge funds lost billions. If we buy and hold nobody will able to destroy the stock price. They can manipulate it to create a panic for a couple hours, but it will bounce back.
Every time Tesla starts to do something spicy it turns around and goes LOLNOPE and bends me back over the table to continue pounding my tight hole with no lube.
Anyone else see their overall flashing red for the first time in a week and think ‚ÄúOh FFS GME what have you went and done.... oh it‚Äôs TESLA .. why is Tesla red?!‚Äù
Was daydreaming looking at Tesla‚Äôs online while my shares were fuckin rocketing Lost the entire amount of the car I was looking at in 15 minutes as it droppedGET ME THAT TESLA RETARDS
Sold 1x Tesla for 3x GME, now holding 11. Holding to the moon!!!
A lot of stocks got ‚Äúbrought back to down to earth‚Äù during that dip. Tesla dropped big. AMC dropped big. Most stocks on my watchlist were green and now red.
Imagine if daddy Elon tweets ‚Äú now you can play a GAME at a STOP light in your Tesla‚Äù
Tesla you whore
Misinformation lambo is short for tesla
#I LIQUADATED PALANTIR TO BUY THE DIP. AND I LOVE HER. DO IT AGAIN I DARE YOU. I‚ÄôLL SELL MY ONE AND ONLY TESLA IDGAF
We are bouncing back. I know this kind of short attacks from 2012. Tesla got attacked like this many times. Right after the attack they bounced twice as harder back. At the end a lot of hedgefunds lost billions.  We will end above $350 end of the day.
I nearly paper handed. But you know what.Fuck this.I'm tired of explaining to my family what unrealised profits are, and that "what ifs" are dangerous.Stop being paper hands, hold onto your shares and make money with everyone.If you cant hold, invest into tesla.
i just watched a Tesla vanish from my life in 30seconds... god daym
Just sold all my Tesla and bought more $GME. Thanks for the discount.
Tesla did this too. It randomly plummeted than shot right back up ü§∑
Don't be tempted by paper hands, Your wife's boyfriend needs a new TeslaIf you hold Long enough, maybe you can have one too!
This is the Tesla scenario again. The lack of volatility shows its setting new price floors on each bounce.
Aight I've done the math. $6716 a share would give me enough capital to pay off 100% of my debts. (including my MTG which currently has 352/360 payments remaining) I appreciate the opportunity cost but at 26 having that much free cash flow would radically change the way I approach my professional goals. Cash flow is more valuable to me than net worth. This would also put half a million in my 401k. Which is more than enough to throw back into safe target date fund and forget about having to save for retirement in 40 years. (~6% annual return gives me ~5 million at 65)BUTThat would use all my tendies. And I can't use all my tendies for non-fun bullshit. (I'd also need some leftovers for taxes) So the price I'm willing to sell is $8500. That would leave enough leftover for taxes, and a Tesla. So for the Shitadel Intern browsing this thread let your boss know I'm willing to sit down and talk when he's ready to meet my offer. 35@$37.1376@$103.45Not investment advice. Just wasting time at work.
If we cross $1000, I‚Äôm buying a Tesla

Tesla: up 20% yesterday,WSB: *wHy iS tEsLa dOwN*
Just sold my Tesla stocks to buy gme. YOLO
A haiku I could sell today,pay my loans, or in two weeksbuy 5 Tesla üåù
Yolo my Tesla shares for gamestop?
I‚Äôve got like 372 dollaridoos in Tesla right now. Thinking about dropping those and putting it all into gme
Sold my Tesla stock I bought when it dipped to $500, made a profit and bought more $GME.
Tesla believe it or not that crap will spike tomorrow
God I hope Tesla goes for round 2 tomorrow
**hey apes remember Tesla went up 110B in market cap in a single day today! dont fall for the fud who are saying 10,000+ is not realistic!**
If gme drops back to $100 I‚Äôll sell all my Tesla and go all in on gme.
If GME can reach 400 and above why can‚Äôt Tesla reach 1000 .. Both are the best swingers in town
Tesla gained 120$ in a day .. Unbelievable.. Drop of 240$ in a day will compensate
If Tesla drops tomo I might shed a tear
Blood red futures means my Tesla puts gonna print tomorrow. Easiest money ever after it went up 20%
Tech is under undervalue.  Tesla is undervalue.  GME is undervalue.
#TESLA BEARS BIG FUCKED!
Michale bury is an idiot if he hasn‚Äôt closed at his Tesla short yet
I just realized that Tesla doesn't sell cars... it sells stock.
Gme $1000 tesla $1000 eow
even better that it isn‚Äôt on a bmw or a Tesla lol.
GUH i sold my Tesla calls too early and bought shitty Sonos calls. Fml
Front page has no tesla gains porn on a 20% day. What has this place become.
Hey its Tesla guy checking in. I put my life savings into calls before the crash for 3/19 and instantly lost 90% of my money in that week. My positions are:815c890c930c1000c1100cIf Tesla and the Musk man bring it over $1000 by this Friday, i will get a Tesla moon diamond hands wsb tattoo to remember these crazy times with my fellow retards. Godspeed.
The only thing crazier than a tesla bull is a tesla bear.
‚ÄúInflation is gonna fuck everything uppp‚Äù*tesla goes up $120 billion in one day* *sub begins clapping and barking like a seal*
Tesla puts tomorrow
Who else is getting a Tesla with their GME gains?What model?
Everyone was trying to find the next Tesla meme quality stonk.. it was still Tesla all along
Wish I had enough money when Tesla dipped down. Congratulations to you guys who actually bought into that though
The world is healing!  Tesla turning into a meme stock again valued at 700b.
Holy fuck tesla still going. This is going to be a true V shape recovery. Cathie is a fucking God among men.
Also huge shoutout to GameStop and Tesla for contributing to this epic milestone. Wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. ü•∞
Wdym we? Don't lump me with you ape. I like the stock and you like the stock.But for real, I fucking like this stock, I became the laughingstock of my family for 3 weeks by refusing to sell at 80+% loss, now I'M the one laughing, can't wait to laugh at them from my brand new Tesla.
Anybody on the Tesla train?
Tesla weeklies was the most profitable play this week. Change my mind.
Tesla and gme everything else is a waste of time
Rip Tesla puts
WHY DID I SELL MY TESLA SHARES AT $422 average price am I FUCKING. RETARDED.
Hey where's that guy that posted he was Financially ruined with the tesla calls and his bank account screenshots.  Did he he recover?
TESLA AND AMC BLEZZED ME TODAY
The first squeese was the greatest advertising campaign in history. Didn't cost them anything and gamestop is now synonymous with ripping down the system. Now that's it's going up a 2nd time it's got a horde of rich loyal fans like tesla! üòÇ
Tesla at 800 by eow. Get Wrekt
You dumb fuck. SpaceX != Tesla.
Cameras inside Tesla factories got hacked. Hackers saw Elon Musk eating Cathie Wood's butthole.
Wtf I love Tesla now
Let‚Äôs get back to our roots with them Tesla yolo calls
Sold my 700 Tesla calls at 675 for 250% profit...I‚Äôm such a fucking retard üíÄ. Where were my diamond hands üöÄüíé
Stocktwits bulls are calling $800 for tesla tomorrow. Maybe this was the top
I really don't get who wouldn't buy Tesla at $570 yesterday but would buy it at $670 today. Nothing has changed rofl
Suddenly Tesla wouldn't overvalued anymore due to their fucking massive income created by selling their cars to us Retards
Tesla gains 2 Ford marketcaps today.  Makes sense.  But its Lord Elon meme lord Musk so its ok
Please protect me from the volatility of Tesla trading CNBC.  Why do you only focus on GME volatility when Tesla gained 100 billion marketcap today?
Looking like a slow squeeze ala tesla
Sorry fellow ü¶ç, I‚Äôm going to disappoint some of you. I won‚Äôt be buying a lambo... ...because EVs are the future and I want a Tesla üòé
Literally the worst advice I‚Äôve ever seen lmfao - ‚Äúdon‚Äôt buy Tesla when it‚Äôs lower than it‚Äôs been in months!!!! Instead buy Exxon after its recent spike!!!‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Right? I mean literally most of the entire world is pushing (even with new laws) for a massive increase in electric vehicle sales and they're seriously suggesting buying Exxon over Tesla?!
Tesla was a sell and Exxon was a buy **last month**.
Another day of staring at lines hoping their green.Congrats to Tesla dip buyers. And fuck you.
Tesla with the bullish finish. Im so moist
If they say buy Exxon, and sell Tesla, I know to do the opposite. Literally the worst advice ever.
If Tesla goes under $500 this week I‚Äôll eat an entire prime rib without au jus
This Tesla ain't gonna pay for itself... GME is!
I want Cathie wood to tie me to the bed while wearing full leather regalia. Tell me what a bad boy I am for selling my Tesla calls and pegging me with a big green dildo. Then I want her to sit on my face so I can suffocate in her fumes while she lets her bull takes turns with me. ü§§ü§§ü§§
If you‚Äôre buying Tesla right now you rode the short bus in high school
Who bought tesla puts ahah
Dont let tesla beat us today in %üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
My trading app legit says hugest riser is Tesla. No mention of GME on this list whatsoever
Tesla loving $666 today
Some clown quotes from yesterday, enjoy ü§°ü§°ü§°:&amp#x200B* Cathie is halfway through a bottle of tequila right now just staring at the fucking wall smoking a cig.  ü§°* And learn. I got this flair for betting against Musk at a time no one else would, and I plan to make my first million doing the same. ü§°* These fucking bears don't even realize how fast recovery can be for tech. The dot com bubble recovered after a mere 8 years. ü§°* Kathy waiting to reveal she‚Äôs gone heavily into $rope. ü§°* If this is the best Tesla can do with wood on tv pumping it then I‚Äôm holding my puts lol. ü§°* I think we‚Äôll start moderately green tomorrow. Nasdaq, DOW, all that. DOW ends up bigly and Nasdaq fades all day and continues to dump this week and until every person who paid $600+ for Tesla is left staring at pictures of a cyber truck wondering how many decepticons they know who would fucking love it. Refreshing Elon‚Äôs Twitter reading shit posts about doggy dimes wondering when he‚Äôll save you. I salute you, Teslatards. ü§°
10 Year auction is tomorrow. It‚Äôs okay to invest in Tesla but protect some of the profits you gained today with an 18% ü§ë money maker rise. Things could end up going south tomorrow. Much love guys.
2 days ago my 3 Tesla puts were worth $804. Now they're worth $30. I deserve this.
Saw a comment last night that had a decent amount of upvotes saying ‚Äúif you aren‚Äôt in Tesla puts, you hate free money‚Äù Big yikes my guy
Damn Tesla really up $100 in a day and I‚Äôll still prolly get burned buying puts
Everytime elon and grimes have sex tesla goes to 666
Did anyone else‚Äôs Tesla FDs just lose so much value
Made 6k on tesla in 1 hour lol
Retard signing in, just woke up and checked my phone, saw the price at $672!!! it's happening! Got out of bed, checked my PC, ok so I was looking at Tesla.... we will get there.
GUYS THE TESLA BUBBLE HAS POPPED!! BURRY WAS RIGHT!!
I bought Tesla Calls yesterday and panick sold for a break even today..... Hella dumb
Tesla moving like it is a small cap company lmao
Tesla made me a very rich man today
Where's that guy who YOLO'd in TESLA calls and was down 30K yesterday. That guy is getting saved by God himself
Holy fuck Tesla. Imagine not buying that dip
Tesla never failsElon never fails Stomach is more important than the brain for stonks
Cathie added 40 million dollars of Tesla sub 600
HODL THE LINE. I‚Äôm late to the party but sold Tesla today (regretting it) and got 115 shares at 230
Fuck the Tesla bears. I hope you all see this, you fucking dipshits.
congrats to the retard who bought tesla calls this morning
Damn, that dude with the Tesla puts yesterday....RIP
Tesla is a fucking monster Jesus Christ
Tesla wants to go back to 900 lol
We have a client that is losing his mind (literally) and I have to listen to him claim he bought GME at $4. Mother fucker you can‚Äôt even wipe your own ass. Also bought Tesla at $100 he claims. Little does he know he‚Äôs got no money and it‚Äôs his wife‚Äôs accounts we look after.
Sold another Tesla to buy 3 more for an even 10 üôåüíé
Gme naturally works its way up to 100k a share before a joint Elon/GabeN press conference announces HL3 exclusive for Tesla vehicles with the new gamestonk app.Short squeeze happens seconds after, GameStop trades sideways for months at 100 million a share.
GME, TESLA AND NIO ARE THE ONLY ONES KEEPING MY PORTFOLIO GREEN ü•≤‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Selling Tesla for GME ended up being one of my better plays
# I'm not fuckin leavin until every single one of you can buy a Tesla.
If this was 20 years ago tesla bulls would be Enron bulls
What if ultimately GameStop just goes the way of Tesla and ends up trading at an insanely high value regardless of what happens because the people believe in GameStop as a future of gaming the same way people view tesla as a company of the future
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are estimated to have made billions of dollars from their bearish bets on Tesla and big tech stocks in the recent knee-jerk selloff triggered by a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed on Tuesday.Tesla was short-sellers' biggest win, giving them estimated profits of $4.2 billion so far in 2021, followed by more than $1 billion gains each on Zoom Video and Apple(AAPL), according to Ortex.They were however burnt by betting against videogame maker Gamestop(GME). The company, which was at the heart of the so-called "stonks" retail trading mania, has jumped another 400% in the past two weeks as amateur investors have jumped back in.GameStop's (GME) e-commerce strategy plans were seen driving this week's renewed gains in January's "meme" stocks, alongside speculation that small investors will use their upcoming stimulus checks to trade.In other major bets, investors made about $1 billion from shorting QQQ, an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100. The tech-heavy benchmark hit correction territory on Monday, slipping more than 10% from record highs.(Reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan editing by Sujata Rao)(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2021.

Tesla to $800 EOW
I purchased Zoom before the pandemic, Moderna at $35 last March, and Tesla pre split at $350... each one of these stocks I doubled my money on and got out way to early.  Currently I have 50 shares of GME around an average of $100 a share and I‚Äôm tired of being a paper hand bitch selling at levels that create no change in my life.  To the moon! I like the stock and I‚Äôm not fucking selling!
Sold a tesla share so I can slowly buy more gme dips since ya boi is broke irl
I got made fun of for holding the bag. Now I take that bag straight to the Tesla dealership to get my wife‚Äôs boyfriend a new car
If GME hits 2500 I'il buy a Tesla Model 3 for no fucking reason at all.
Chances Tesla hits $700 by the end of the week?
The question is what color will my Tesla be? I‚Äôm thinking about green
if GME hits 10k I will buy a teslaedit: not today only
Fuck me. I‚Äôm on the Tesla website. What am I doing. ‚ÄúDeep Blue metallic‚Äù or ‚ÄúRed Milti Coat‚Äù?
The day after I buy puts tesla launchesStory of my fucking life
My father had 90k around December and was asking me what stock he should get and I told him to just buy GME and keep buying it because I have kept up with DFV. You wanna know what he did? Bought Tesla instead and when GME shot up I looked at him and said ‚Äúyou could have made almost a million dollars with your 90k and what did you do instead? Bought Tesla that‚Äôs been going down the shitter‚Äù. And so, here I am, shaking my head thinking about the fact that he could have paid those tax‚Äôs, paided off the house, the car and still have well over 300k. And when GME presented another opportunity to buy low last month around 50, I told him to just spend at least 10k on it and you would still see a massive profit and yet again he didn‚Äôt listen. Remember folks, history repeats itself twice. First as a tragedy and the second as a farce.
good to see that nancy pelosi's tesla calls are still shitting all over her
No they‚Äôll have sex with the Tesla.
If Tesla gets to 300 by the end of the next trading week, I will get a SEC tattoo on my lower back, no homo.
Tesla China sales are up 1500 more than last quarter. Let that sink in... first quarter is usually the slowest.
Just a reminder TSLA @ $563 is $2815 pre-split price. It's got a ways to drop imo. Gonna be a rough couple YEARS for the TCMs (Tesla Cult Members).
Whoever has puts on tesla must be making a killing
i remember a month ago telling my gf i could pay off my student loans and buy a tesla with my gains from 2020, now i can pay off half and get the new brakes i need for my civic
Tesla trying for six straight red days and five straight red weeks, impressive!
One of these days some random news will drop and Tesla will obliterate everything
Tesla was great at one point just as id imagine nancy pelosi‚Äôs massive jugs were when she was younger but just like her tits Tesla will just go lower as time passes
#TESLA INCLUSION WAS A MISTAKE!!!!!
Let Tesla rip before buying it. No need to catch the falling knife.
Eh, if Tesla goes up to $700 tmmr, Square to $240, FB to $270 and Riot to $65, I‚Äôll make all my money back from the last 3 weeks and a little more
Tesla 420 is not a meme. üòî
I think I‚Äôll finally try Tesla puts tomorrow
24 is still high af. That's literally billions. If you try to cover them it'll go thru the roof. I don't even care about SI anymore. There is so much buying pressure just because of media coverage and analysts upgrading GME to buy. IMO, the same thing is gonna happen with GME what happened with Tesla.
So I made about $1500 YOLOing the last of my savings in GME. If I save $700 for rent, utilities, and food for the month then it leaves me with $800. I can take out two $5000 cash advances on my Chase and Discover Cards (giving me $10k total) at only 15% APR to put down on a Tesla Model 3 and use the $800 on the first month's payment / misc fees. I think if I get lucky on a few calls (like even $2,000), then I could easily pay my car payments for a few month. Thoughts?
Tesla needs to crash to $200 so I can pick up tons of shares
Seeing Ford rise and Tesla crash turns me on so hard
RIP to that guy that bought 6 dollar Tesla puts instead of 600. He would‚Äôve made so much money
More PLTR and Tesla purchases prob lol
prediction: GME will have a higher share price than Tesla within the next 2 months.
Tesla probably for me.
Tesla would be at $90 right now without Cathie catching all those knives.
Ya thats probably why Tesla is down  they had to liquidate their position in EVERYTHING to cover up to now.
Who needs the Boring company when Tesla can drill this hard?
Tesla $420 is not a meme.
Dear Elon,I am sorry I shorted TSLA. Dear Elon,thank you for my new Tesla!
Tesla dropped -53% from Feb to march same time last year and currently only dropped -36%so far. If you can't handle riding the wild Elon musk dick cowgirl style then maybe you should stick to safer stock.
Pretty sad I can't share in my pain from losses on Tesla, Palantir, Apple, etc because this sub won't shut the fuck up about GME. I get it, it's amazing, and I'm glad it's workout out for people who bought the dip. But holy fuck the influx of 7 million members on JUST GameStop hype is unhealthy as shit for content.
So Cathy has been a major indicator for me. She buys, I wait a day and then buy puts. Easiest way to make money. See when she bought Open,Zoom,, Peleton, Tesla, Unity, etc. She literally has the üåàüêª touch right now
Debt first. A Tesla will only go down in value while paying off your debts as early as possible will save you money.
Guys I just want to pay off my college debt... or buy a Tesla üòÇ
People don‚Äôt realize Tesla was a scam. Real coincidence that musk had a bonus riding on reaching a certain valuation. Real coincidence Goldman gave Tesla a huge price upgrade right before conducting Tesla‚Äôs equity offering. At one point Tesla did a gamma squeeze. That accounted for its huge increase more than any company specific news. Businesses don‚Äôt sustain 2000 P/E ratios. It‚Äôs fucking disgusting that Tesla was hailed as this retail investor play when retail investors were getting scammed. What‚Äôs fucked is none of the dudes who rode the Tesla wave up are still fully vested. They got out and left us (the indexes) to clean up the mess. Musk needs to spend every penny he has artificially propping up Tesla through buying or he needs to be investigated for securities fraud.
I been saying for a month now butGME IS THE NEW TESLA
$420.69 is a lock for Tesla at this point
If GME hits 1k EOM I will buy a Tesla and get GME2MN as my license plate
&gt GME moves from Russell 500 to Russell 1000[The selling from Russell 2000 funds will likely be matched by buying from Russell 1000 funds.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-stock-volatility-could-get-even-worse-heres-why-51614360082)  It may add to volatility, but I assume not much.  Tesla on the other hand went from no index fund to S&ampP.
What happened to Tesla? About to sell my shares and just go all in on GME.
Buying Tesla is like catching a falling knife
If I cashed out now, I could pay for a nice little vacation for myself when the pandemic is over. If I keep this üíéüíéüíé hands, I‚Äôll get my Gucci loafers, a vacation and a Tesla
Tesla or homeless!
Bought in at $270, averaged down to $90 when it was trading between 40-50    If I cashed out I could cover most of my books and fees for next semester    Or I can hold till I get a goddam Tesla so that goddam sorority girl finally notices me. All or nothing.
I was 100% Tesla 2 months ago. Sold all at 820$ and now I am 100% GME. Needless to say it served my portfolio well
Grab your fucking pitchforks. We‚Äôre going back to September - January daily threads and finding the fuckers that bid up Tesla to an 800 billion market cap before dumping it on the SP500 index. Thanks for crashing the indexes for an automobile company....or wait is it a tech company? No they definitely don‚Äôt want to be a tech company now right???
Looked at Tesla down 35% in a month and thought maybe the bottom is nearing, then I realized it‚Äôs still trading at $2,800 pre split levels. Was trading at 1/7th this cap a year ago. Holy shit, still may have at least another 35% to go. I‚Äôm not even a bear, but that correction might last a while. Hope not as it is hurting the tech sector in general.
gme gonna pass tesla and the world will implode.
Cathy rubbing her woman wood all over tesla on cnbc
FFS shitadel, finish unloading your Tesla position
Alright screw it I‚Äôm selling my shares of Tesla and buying more GME
Can Tesla get delisted from S&ampP? Surely it‚Äôs below threshold now
Tesla 550 eod, 420 eow
Tesla plummeting, ARKK doomed, QQQJ in freefall.  Glad I got some poooots
Cmon baby papa needs a purple lambo and a money green Tesla
If BB and GME squeeze the squoze together, I'm going to fucking $CUM.I was picking out lambo colors but then decided to go the Tesla roadster route. Think about, it'll be safer for you and the bears wives' if your car auto drives while you're all coked out.
I bought a 2014 f250 king ranch diesel for 40k$ 3 years ago. I have put 120k miles on it in those 3 years and the dealership wants to buy it from me for $37500.FORD CALLS TESLA PUTS ALL DAY BABY. Ford goes up in value Tesla trash
This pullback will not stop the inevitable global take over by big tech. You‚Äôll remember this dip when you‚Äôve got a FB vr headset strapped to your face while your self driving Tesla brings you to your Amazon warehouse slave job.
We've reached the point where any one who bought TESLA since November has lost money
So Tesla 400 EOW?
I own a Porsche and tried a Tesla. It takes you 10 seconds to realize how badly made a Tesla is
This is the end for Tesla.  RIP.  Out of business by the end of the year.
Anyone else think GME is the new TESLA? I see it staying high with them doing a few stock splits here and there and the price being volatile as fuck
Tesla Roadster or Kia Toaster.
Don't fucking care how low it dips, I'm either getting enough to buy a Tesla or losing it all
Upvote this to replace Tesla with Gamestop in the S&ampP 500
Imagine buying Tesla 4 months ago and making 0$
Did you think, one year ago, that 2 shares of gme would almost equal a share of tesla?
fuck this im selling tesla
Some time ago they laughed at me. They said i was a bag holder. ‚ÄúIdiot. It‚Äôs just a cult. You‚Äôre all stupid.‚ÄùWell look who‚Äôs laughing now you degenerate fucks. How‚Äôs your Tesla? How‚Äôs your Apple? Getting tired of seeing red? When your entire portfolio is GME... you only see green. Sorry, this cult isn‚Äôt accepting new members.
When you listen to the talking heads and they call us irrational and disconnected, do not react emotionally. Use their sentiment as a data point to collect.They said the same thing about Tesla, and bought in way later.
The higher this goes the nicer pokemon cardsI MEAN TESLA i can buy
So glad I sold tesla for this two weeks ago üöÄ
Im finally gonna get to prove my brother wrong when he told me i was retarded and was gonna lose money by putting it in gme well i am retarded but im making money soon we‚Äôll be worth more than tesla
Can someone take Tesla behind the barn and beat that shit with a bat
I was up $650 with Tesla before it dipped hard. Same with Apple. Now I've sold my shares at a loss to buy more GME.
Tesla still overvalued
Bought Tesla at $900 AMA ü§°
Will never forgive myself for selling 100 shares. Instead of pullin up to work in a tesla, im just gonna make a few grand :(
If Tesla hits $2 I‚Äôm going all in
Gimme your fucking lunch money hedgies, daddy wants a Tesla
New tesla, Gme
RIP Tesla, pls go to 50 so I can buy a few hundred shares.
GME already made enough to purchase a very nice engagement ring.... But we're not stopping there! We're gonna pay for the wedding, the honeymoon, A solar panel system, a QT Roller Grill, An industrial soft serve ice cream machine, a Purple Tesla,  Ferrari/McClaren, and I might pay off some medical bills too.
Ok, my honest take here. The market was due for a correction. I think we all knew this, except for those who joined post GME shit.  Tech was waay too expensive, appl(splitting), tsla splitting, amazon going to all time highs, just way overbought. Hell even i got some tesla at 700. But now, the market is really rotating, not none of that CNBC rotating headlines. Like forreal into the next wave of gainers. I think they are shaking the tree, seeing what people are favoring by getting rid of the over leveraged noobies( like me) and my shit picks.  They take their gains and rotate em into what stocks we favored(prob with good reason), and those that paper hands sold for a discount. Its a good play on their part. Meanwhile we have to just chill, let the bear walk by, dont look em in the eye, and it will be over soon.
Tesla $540 tomorrow
Bro Tesla really about to be under $600
Cathie got exposed like all of us that thought we knew what we were doing when Tesla was blowing up
Tldr GME got huge green dildo at expense of what seemed almost whole market  including Tesla
Sold my Tesla puts after making 150k. We‚Äôre gonna dead cat bounce the next week
Tesla is a great example. Had you been holding VTI for over a decade you would have been holding Tesla from the beginning instead of just recently when it was added to the S&ampP 500.
Daddy y did gme go to the moon? Because of legends selling there Tesla stock. Most baller shit ever.
I‚Äôm hoping TSLA keeps going down while GME keeps going up so I can buy and get more bang for my buck. I love tendies in a Tesla
Tesla has become the same as Apple. Fans jizz over any little new thing which will probably keep the stonks fairly high.
If it were ever 100 dollars again I would buy stupid amounts of TeslaNever bet against Elon Musk
Tesla short sellers and naysayers are something else. God himself could tell them they're wrong in plain english and they'd tell him that he doesn't understand the fundementals.I can't even imagine being that deep in denial lol
Remember that guy who turned 500 to 1milly on Tesla callsYeah fuck that guy
Are you my husband? I just straight up poached the tesla. The glove box is full with all my cosmetics and feminine care, with a pin so he can't reclaim it.
At least we did better than Tesla üòÉüöÄüòÉüöÄüòÉ
You can buy an actual Tesla soon, all good!   üíéüôåüèªüíéüôåüèªüíé
I won't care if people think I'm the bad guy when my tesla is driving me to chick fil a
&lt10 dollar stock that pays .10 in dividends and pulled in 5x more net income than tesla last year. This is deep fuckin value
Your daily reminder to get the PowerUp rewards membership at GameStop. This is like getting a Tesla before it is cool.
I mean, maybe? But tesla is down 100 billion plus, and $GMEs MCap isn‚Äôt really that substantial.. which is why we were sending this bitch to the moon before RH dicked us down
Can't Elon just tweet buy tesla and all is well in the world again?
kept all my tesla (been in since 290) the gains keep me from crying over any of my lesser diamond hand losses :D
Not to be a dick but who would sell Tesla if it‚Äôs the long term play?
Why don‚Äôt bears post things like ‚Äúif Tesla goes to 400 I‚Äôll drink my own piss‚Äù Pussies
As GME goes up and Tesla goes down, my portfolio diversity is getting weird af
Im going to use my gains from buying puts on TSLA to buy a Tesla
Tonight and tomorrow the goal is to set new price floors. It's literally turning itself into a Tesla situation dorks. MMs/clearing houses won't be able to kill trading if the gain is gradual.
When I saw that green shrek dildo on GME after tesla got hammered 8% I had an instant wave of relief
Apple, AMD, NVDIA, NIO and Tesla bleeding meanwhile GME winning, we love to see it
PLTR could announce partnerships with Tesla, SpaceX, Amazon and Netflix and MAYBE then could we crack $25 again.
I bought tesla and GME with my rkt gains, and I‚Äôll buy the dip again for Tesla
I can afford Tesla... Model S AND shares
who wants to bet that Cathy loaded up on Tesla today
Did you not see all the other stocks there? They‚Äôre either meme stocks or EV stocks. Tesla &amp Nio are notorious for being ‚Äúdetached from reality‚Äù and ‚Äúcompletely disregard fundamentals‚Äù. No matter how you spin it, this is a market sell off and the only stock not tanking is the one full of üíéüôåüèº I‚Äôm gonna hold on tight to my lottery ticket and I‚Äôll be sure to cash it in when I win üòâ
INB4 TSLA fans mention: \- Self driving tech that is admittedly on par with everyone else working on self-driving. \- Fantasies where people will start renting out their cars as taxis. \- Energy storage tech that, AFAICT, has no moat to prevent competitors from swooping in once the market matures.  Elon/Tesla deserve credit and I'm not saying they're an absolute dog, but they are a hype stock driven by zealots who have suspended their critical thinking skills.  They make cars.  Decent cars with many innovations but they are still a car company.  IME, their fanboys are tech folks who are smart enough to fetishize and appreciate the Tesla innovations, but not smart enough to realize that Tesla has serious, viable competition and does not possess 'secret sauce' when it comes to tech.
Offloaded the rest of my Tesla for power hour today
We're gonna pump tesla again like March 2020
Well Tesla is currently imploding, he pretty much called the top
Do Tesla bulls still exist
Tried options for the first time, decided to go with Tesla. I thought I bought 90 call options with a 720$ strike for mid March 2022.Turns out I went full retard with mid March 2021. My brain did not realized that we‚Äôre already in 2021.
Holy crap. GME investors are still going. Woah this has to be longer then Tesla. 3 months of a rally.
RIP Pelosi Tesla calls
Finally bought some puts just to protect my TSLA position.  So it official, the bottom is in.  You can buy Tesla
Tesla. But like I‚Äôm buying an actual car
He called the tesla crash when it was above 820. Down 27% now. I think he knows what he is talking about a little more than 1 time.
Tesla will no longer be cool when you see your HS teacher driving it.
Tesla reverse split incoming
Ofc he did. He‚Äôs shorting TeslaLet‚Äôs see if the guy who beat America in 2008 can be the shorter who takes on ElonI like Elon more though. Michael Burry‚Äôs portfolio is a gay bear‚Äôs wet dream. Literally all land, water, and gold with some stocks.
Wow was Tesla overvalued??
All my Tesla into GME #ILiKetHeStoNk
Ouch.. The bright side is its Tesla so it will go back up eventually. Dont wanna be one of those guys but averaging down might not be a bad idea before it jumps
Tesla is powered by belief and Autistlon MuskTheres no rhyme or reason to its value Do you believe others will believe
If I see 500s I am selling everything and loading up on Tesla, because that shit is flying right back to the promise land.
I'm in Manhattan If I was earning that I'd buy a Tesla lolWhen you earn 35k you spend accordingly to that. Rent will always take most of it but you sacrifice.Someone earning 130k probably gets too comfortable spending money on their desires, like owning a Tesla lol, living in a market rate apartment in East Village, getting coffee from Starbucks and buying lunch every day at restaurants then going out and their wives likes stuff too, you got to keep the wife happy. So the 130k becomes their normal as in 30k for someone else with both hoping to get a raise and the cycle continues.
205@9.75If it hits $40 like someone said. I'm carving UWMC onto the hood of my Tesla.
I might buy back in to Tesla when it gets below 300
Wow I cant believe the great collapse happened and I got caught in it after saying all of last year how over valued this shit is. The indexes arent even close to capturing the losses in overvalued stocks from 2020. Peloton: 167 to 107Docusign: 260 to 218Tesla: 880 to 645 and fallingNio: 62 to 40ZM: 568 to 349Fastly: 113 to 67Apple: 139 to 122 Moderna: 183 to 130
If PLTR announces a partnership with Tesla to install their data programs in all of their cars and also a partnership with onlyfans, we'll be golden.
Tesla is nearly 4 times larger than the #2 car manufacturer in the world by market cap. What possible long term gains could there be beyond that? They aren't going to have a worldwide monopoly on cars.
TSLA is heading for another down day today. Over the last 6 weeks, Tesla has lost \~29% from the peak of $900. But it is still 9X above the low of $70.Some of my friends are sitting on shares with average purchase price below $400, waiting for Long term capital gain. I sold way too early, don't plan I want to buy back. This is too volatile and risky for me.What would you do? wait for LTCG or sell now?
If only there was an entire asset class that was created at the height of the last great recession that acts as a form of electronic gold and has showed thousands of times the return of gold since then.Maybe Tesla knows where to find some.
AAPL and TESLA  very disappointing lately üòï
Wait. Is banana good or bad in your scenario? Me dumb ape.AMC shares are still a bit undervalued. Yes disney is trying to make the "pay for our service and then pay 30 more dollars for a movie rental for just yourself" a *thing*, but there is still a huge market for movies in theaters. AMC did dilute their stock to pay off some debt, which killed any chance for a squeeze, but it will make them a better bet long term. Also I said they were a "decent" investment, not a "tesla at $50 per share last year" investment.
I‚Äôm about to be on a plane all day but if Tesla hits $700 today I‚Äôll drink my own semenYes I will use a thermometer to verify as that is apparently a thing. Pin this
Doesn't matter to me if you're into GME, UWMC, RKT, Palantir, Tesla, ornamental gourd futures. There's no need to antagonize each other. You like X, do business with X, post your gains/loss porn.
Who knew Tesla and GME would ruin the whole market?  We may all be broke soon but at least this shit will be in financial textbooks
The year is 2025. The Market is literally tits up. The Bull Run of ‚Äò20-‚Äò24 was so epic that all of WSB is now rich. President Wood is about to make her State of the Union address and is expected to announce that stocks will no longer be able to go down, ever. The color red has been removed from elementary school teachings. You kiss your wife before leaving for work in your new Tesla model BB (powered by Ivy). You wife‚Äôs boyfriend was promoted to manager at your local Wendy‚Äôs and gives you free trendies whenever you stop by. You quit your job and are now a top executive at GameStop. Life is good.
Instead of buying the Tesla dip last week, I bought the ARKK dip thinking it was the safer/smarter bet ü§°
Dr. Michael Burry says Tesla stock bad.If there‚Äôs one thing I know it‚Äôs that Michael Burry is probably smarter than me.
funniest thing is that there was this one guy who bought tesla at 900. absolute legend of calling tops
Tesla calls in august üòÇ
Yes Tesla spank my balls harder
I wish I sold my Tesla stocks for $900 and buy it back now
I thought the same. This woman has a vision to pick stocks with strong potencial and Palantir will be her new Tesla (for those who don‚Äôt know, she defended and buy a lot of Tesla back in 2019 when everyone was selling). Buy and hold $PLTR üöÄüöÄ
I‚Äôm selling Tesla tomorrow for.... checks notes..... Carnival Cruise... GUH.
Tesla puts at open I‚Äôll say it again!!!
To be honest, tesla at 200 sounds amazing. Just pump every thing else tho.
Gone, are the days of TRaDe TaLKS GoiNg WELl.  No more midnight conversations with Tim Apple. Sweet dreams to rocket man, elon tesla.  Goodbye dreamland. Welcome back to the real world.
I have $185,000 in Tesla puts right now and I am jacked to the fucking tits
Who else is jumping on Tesla puts tomorrow and what strike. This bitch is gonna keep drilling
Michael Burry sitting at home with his Tesla puts like bwahahahahahaha
Honestly I don‚Äôt want it to happen but mentally we need to prepare to see these numbers tomorrow *sigh* Tesla 600 and nio 38
Tesla puts are undervalue üôÑ
All the  "bear" comments are still just bulls saying were fucked.Back when there were plenty of bears and before trillion dollar stimmies you'd get shit like:Bear 5 standing by...Tesla bear standing by...Build a bear bear standing by....There are still very few of us left.
People in here will warn you about inflation and in the same breath tell you Tesla should be worth $4 trillion
Anyone got Tesla above 800?
With that introduction I thought the Tesla self drove them to the hospital or delivered the kid. Lol
Is Tesla a value stock now?
I know I'll catch shit for this but, I'm buying more PLTR. After the position Cathy added to Ark today I'm even more confident that my thesis was right: This will be another Tesla or Facebook and in 20 years might even be more relevant than those two companies because consumer tastes are fickle but businesses will always want to hire Palantir to mine their data if they can make more money. It might jump around now but it'll settle and grow. Probably won't buy a ton of LEAP but focus instead on these cheap shares and maybe write some covered calls to offset any short term volatility. Fortunately that crazy IV leads to higher premiums when you write to open.
Buy Tesla puts every Monday and calls every Friday
Tesla is undervalue
Why is everyone here complaining about the market going red lately? I would have killed to have shorted the market last March. You guys do realize you can buy puts and make crazy money also right? I've been riding Tesla the whole way down this week. Oh wait, I forgot,  nobody here does options anymore and this sub has turned into stocktwitz 2.0 but somehow worse.
Tesla falls to $500 and this sub says nothing, this place really has changed
Tesla is gonna go up by Friday. It has to, it‚Äôs gonna be my bday.
Like am I retarded for worrying more about my tech positions like apple and Tesla than GameStop? I honestly feel like GameStop is the safest stock to own rn wtf?üíÄ
Tesla FDs it is
Lemme tell you about this upcoming monthTomorrow BUZZ ETF comes out, and JPOW speaks live.JPOW will tell the world how healthy the economy, and how GME is his favorite stock. Everyone will talk about GME and BUZZ will make it it‚Äôs largest holding.Biden will instantly executive order triple stimmys and cure covid, opening america.GME will squeeze to $100,000 a share and the market will collapse. JPOW will then tweet  about how bonds are undervalued imo.With the gains from stimmy powered GME, retailers will aggressively buy the dip, in turn short squeezing the entire market.By the end of March, SPY will be worth $4000. PLTR will still be at $25 of course.With a booming economy, the US cuts all trade with gyna and takes over Hong Kong. Biden taps Trump to become the US head of Twitter to ensure the market never has a red day again, keeping constant pressure on gyna. China begins to fight back, but PLTR is able to suppress the war entirely without costing us a single soldier. PLTR is still sitting at $25.At the end of the year, Ryan Cohen is announced as CEO of GameStop. He has created drone powered VR goggles so that you may enjoy only fans (now hosted on twitch after the GameStop acquisition) on the go. Biden steps down and GameStop is elected President.In GameStop‚Äôs first 100 days, 50% of the US budget is allocated to Tesla and SpaceX. SpaceX IPOS, instantly becomes worth $1M per share, and a colony is soon established on Mars.Mars is renamed GameStop, and all stockholders are given a free ticket to create a colony of gigachad martians. PLTR is contracted to oversee the project and ensure efficiency, it doubles in price by the end of the next year.
Jesus, Cathie. More PLTR and TESLA!?!
Cathie wood coming out with a new PT for tesla ... very bullish
Started trading in September, just before the Tesla S&ampP fuck up. Got rekt in September and October. Made back the losses in November. Rode the rally and made some money in December and January. Lost half of the profits in February. Been fun. My mind is conditioned into thinking any rally is short lived and the market is on the verge of collapse all the time
They print more money every quarter than Tesla for the entire year yet they still trade below IPO/NAV price. CEO Matt should be on Twitter posting more often I guess. No offense to other meme stocks but UWMC and RKT both have solid fundamentals and they make tons of $$$$. Why don‚Äôt we provide for an additional exposure to solid companies rather than continue to prop at risk/failing businesses?
I think I should order my Tesla now. https://imgur.com/YIscvcN.jpg
there is no ARK bubble. the suits did this to tesla a bunch of times and cathie beat them, now they are doing it to her other stocks. she will win again.
My gamestop stock is keeping my entire account from going red for the day damn and this is with palantir and tesla and apple.
The day is tomorrowRocket launch goes wellElon reveals the entire rocket was electric and fueled by Tesla batteriesTesla dips 50%
Life was better when Tesla was the meme stock...
People in the Tesla investors club are saying they‚Äôll buy more when it reaches $400. Not even they think this thing is valued right
Nancy Pelosi show me that Tesla loss porn and that ginormous rack
Nows our chance to buy 0.1 shares of tesla
If I can still hold my Tesla $848 stock(down to $658)You can hold your GMEMy Tesla is red, my GME is green...they both even out into a beautiful brown color
CMON BEARS GET TESLA DOWN TO $400 SO I CAN POUR MY LIFE SAVINGS IN IT üöÄüöÄ This will be the greatest of all dips!
13k in tesla shares or what
Pour one out for Aunt Cathie, who bought the Tesla dip too early
56k on my Tesla puts today. But please keep thinking the stock market is a cooperative pyramid scheme
Sure it's valid if the stock is worth a damn. Tesla gave stock to employee as compensation and it's working out great for them.Stock in a small company that you are relying on being worth something in 30 years seems stupid. Doesn't make their reasoning invalid.
Hertz was a joke that people actually ended up going in on. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a meme stock like amd, gme, or Tesla.
Love how the insta thots who were spamming their stories with their Tesla gain screenshots are now replacing those stories with yoga pants advertisements
I love Tesla but if this shit wipes me out I hope it goes back to 200$ a share... fuck you Elon Musk for being more worried about üêï coin
My move is all in on uwmc. Just released March 10 UWMC 5% dividend. PT released for $16. Added to Russell index the 23 which is index that made tesla fly. Ceo on cramer very soon. This is not soley an RKT play. Mark my words this will fly today and I‚Äôm holding at least till russel index addition on the 23rd
Ok Cathy, drop that updated Tesla report whenever.
March 10 UWMC 5% dividend. PT released for $16. Added to Russell index the 23 which is index that made tesla fly. Ceo on cramer very soon. Good dip add rn if you missed out on earlier dip
March 10 UWMC 5% dividend. PT released for $16. Added to Russell index the 23 which is index that made tesla fly. Ceo on cramer very soon. This is not an RKT sympathy play. Just broke resistance and only few thousand outstanding short shares left. Seems like we squeeze gentlemen

They sold less than 4K YTD mustang Mach E. So let‚Äôs say 48k at years end ( if sales don‚Äôt increase, I‚Äôm sure they will some)  that‚Äôs ok for sales but not a category leader. Love Ford, but people want the young sexy girl ( Tesla NIO other retard EV plays)
RKT reports $2.3B income is only valued at $48B, Tesla reports only $721M income but is valued at $780B. Don't let these wall st crooks shake you out. People need a home more than they need an electric car. Hold together!
If gme could go ahead and moon, I don‚Äôt want to fix my shitty car. I‚Äôd rather get a Tesla
This is wsb Tesla was the original squeeze
Fuck a lambo, Tesla gang where you at
Fun fact: UWMC makes more money than Tesla (1.4B net income per quarter, 800% growth YoY and only 16B market cap). This stock is worth at least $25 per share. ü§ëü§ëü§ë
If it hits 100k a share I'll fuck a Tesla and buy your wife a new boyfriend.
Tesla announcing lithium charged vibrators integrated with AI learning. releasing tomorrow. Rumors of largest size to be called Elon‚Äôs wang v2
He said the [same thing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-autonomous-idUSKBN24A0HE) last year...
TESLA
The move tm is just like any other day. I‚Äôm a simple retard, really, I wake up at 7 and tend to my garden. At 830 I watch PLTR go up and I contemplate selling everything at a minimal loss to fomo into whatever you retards are talking about. I then picture myself in a 2035 Tesla driving to my Tesla house in Tesla, Texas. I wait for the inevitable dip, and I buy more. A true retard
"Why does this subreddit exist, you might ask? Well, WSB is the result of a responsibility crisis within millennials caused by ‚Äúlower for longer‚Äù monetary policy: Zero interest rates and rock-bottom bond yields have caused the death of savings accounts and the birth of a ‚Äúlive fast, die young‚Äù culture within personal finance. Why save money for your retirement when you can Y.O.L.O your life savings ‚Äî or stimulus check ‚Äî shorting Tesla or going long Amazon in the midst of an economic crisis?"They would have won one of those two bets
I remember when stocks except Tesla would move 4-5 dollars a day over the summer and we would collectively shit our pants. Now 20 dollars is to be expected. And if it moves more than 40, it's average. Jesus my valuation of money and expectations are so fucked. I get mad of I take profits at anything less than 60%... What have I become over these last few years. Maybe I should just invest in gourds while I'm at it
OK U GUYS CONVINCED ME. IF UWMC GOES TO $30 I'LL BUY A TESLA MODEL 3 PERFORMANCE AND BRAG ABOUT IT HERE üöóüí®
Literally if you lined up 10 professional traders and said "pick the one stock that is most detached from fundamentals" I would put $100 down saying every one of them would pick Tesla. GME is not even close to their level right now. If GME traded at $5,000 for 3 months straight, we would be on the same level - that's how absurd it is.
That‚Äôs why tesla and other high growth names have been dumping when bond yields go up. They are the first to get the multiple compression since their p/es are so high. As the yields go higher it‚Äôll start to affect more growth companies with lower p/es in the 30-40s
Your mom is the new Tesla
If it hits 100k a share, then I too would like to request your services for my wife. One Tesla you say?
If it hits 100k a share, I‚Äôll let you buy me a Tesla AND fuck your wife with her boyfriend watching
Bill Gates even said it himself, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Bet Against that Man (Elon Musk)‚Äù Gates shorted Tesla a while back and got burned..
I mean they don't have any competition right now. Lucid might be a threat in a few years but think about how long it took tesla to scale. Even if lucid takes 1/4th of the time, tesla has a massive headstart. On top of that tesla also has battery, solar, and self driving tech that they develop IN HOUSE. That's a massive advantage that shouldn't be ignored
A Tesla truck is real fuck you money. It's so damn ugly but you can buy it and just not care.
I‚Äôve got a Tesla that I paid the loan off with wsb money. Half of me wants to flex on my neighbor cause he‚Äôs kind of a dick and an investment manager at a bank or some bs. The other half knows that‚Äôd be kinda cringey if I told him I‚Äôm basically making my living off yoloing otm calls from autistic wsb DD. Anyway fuck that dude cursing out his kids 24/7 and getting his fuckin car repossessed and shit lmao
I have been thinking about that sweet as Tesla truck
Can papa Elon tweet a rocket emoji? I want my calls to buy me a tesla
Tesla killing me. RKT saved my butt today.So is the plan to go with UWMC tomorrow instead of RKT?
Yeah, exactly. And because she was retried, she sold the Tesla for a nice gain. Hindsight is 20/20, but she still made a ton of money off of it.Her husband bought thousands of dollars worth of Tesla in 2010 (I believe it was like $4/share at the time) and sold in 2018 when it was about $65-$70/share. It made sense at the time because that's still an extremely nice payday, especially for a retired widow. But it sucks because she missed out on tens of millions of dollars (maybe even over $100 million depending on how much he bought back in 2010).I don't know the exact details because he's not my grandfather, but I know the basics because of what they told me.
buying a tesla with rkt gains
It didn‚Äôt skyrocket until 2020 though, I have a lot of Tesla friends who sold at least a  year or two before. Only have 1 friend who sold portions of his stock last year after 7 years of ESPP, grants. We never bought in because we were tired of him lol.Btw It was already pretty volatile early 2020 so if they bought in at IPO and sold after a year, it was still good money.
Pretty impressive foresight to do that 20 years ago. Especially since Tesla was founded 17 years ago and IPO'd 10 years ago.
Tesla hasn‚Äôt even been around for 20 years so I hope you‚Äôre just getting an exaggerated story. Their IPO was in 2010.
Dropped 2k on GME for a total of 16.606618 shares. Do I preorder my Tesla today or tomorrow?
Tesla daily looking like the stairs i'm about to throw myself down
Followed a guy on Reddit named sir jack a lot and made a million dollars. -someone explaining their new tesla to the neighbor
Please auntie wood, no more Tesla
Even Tesla crashed today. No fear
Anyone else find GME long squeezing like Tesla did last year? Eerily similar.
Tesla is on ‚Äúlook how they massacred my boy‚Äù meme
So Tesla to infinity when the squeeze has squoze?
Switch those tesla calls to puts! Then you win both!
You go you wild fukn ape! I love you and all my family! Apes to the moon to live free and stop being used and abused by these HF slave owners! It‚Äôs time we get to the moon then come back in our own Tesla space ships and take these HF wives and GFs for a real ride! Let‚Äôs go bois! HODL, BUY, REPEAT!
Tesla is the Air Force 1
They weren‚Äôt  sure how we feel abt tesla hahaha
Options stop trading at 4pm.Owners of ITM long calls or put have the write to instruct their brokerage against automatic exercise until 5:30pm (or 5:15pm, not sure) the latest. After that anything in the money gets exercised automatically, and the clearing house assigns it.What you may have happen is, if the share price goes OTM during 4pm-5:30pm then your options will not get exercised (see what happened with Tesla back in September), the so-called pin risk if I recall the term correctly.
Where the fuck is Tesla
im bullish on Tesla dropping $50 next week
Life savings is on $TSLA and down 85%. If Tesla hits $1300+ by 3/19/21 I will get a wsb tattoo/sleeve on my wrist
 i love Bruce , but honestly people should think about spending their money in GME instead of making donations to bruce. When we hit 10000 everyone of us can buy him a Tesla
To all the people considering selling. Is there really any other stock with this much potential? What are you gonna invest in? Tesla? Apple? Weed? Alright good luck have fun
&gtDoes anyone actually use bitcoin? drug dealers, traffickers, and now, Tesla. As a currency it blows. As a speculative commodity it sure is great at letting people park money in something they don't really understand
90milion volume. More than popular stocks like Tesla.  You know they are working hard to keep prices down by ladder attacking.
It‚Äôs the year 2031, I get on my Gamestop Airlines flight departing from New Gamestop and landing on Los Gamestop, as I drive my Tesla home. As soon as I get home I hop into my pool and once I get out my son Game Stop the third asks me about my ‚ÄúDeep Fucking Value‚Äù tattoo on my lower back. I look him deep in the eyes and tell him ‚ÄúWhere he goes, I go, if he holds the line, I‚Äôm standing right next to him‚Äù.
&gt wife and I bring home 75k combined a year pre-taxAlmost or above half your combined income is too much for a car.&gt Now we are gonna be family planning in the next few years and are thinking that it may be the time to upgrade from my current hybrid sedan, into a crossover that is multifunctional.Nothing is changing in life and you‚Äôre saying you will be maybe thinking about having a kid in a few years.  What‚Äôs more, a model y will do absolutely nothing that a hybrid sedan can‚Äôt already.&gt We both love Tesla‚Äôs and think this may be the time to invest in something nicer!A Tesla isn‚Äôt an investment.&gt Our monthly loan payment for 60 months would be about $830. Roughly 17% of your monthly take home on a car payment alone is *way* too much.&gt In our minds now seems like a great time to use this housing opportunity and lack of major debts (besides my college)And if the housing opportunity goes away given the strong economic uncertainty?  This car would absolutely strangle you if anything changed.  I‚Äôd say even with the current housing it‚Äôs lightly strangling you.  You don‚Äôt have any major debts ‚Äî except for the 30k you do already owe, which means you *do* have major debts.&gt to get a nicer vehicle that will ideally not depreciate an insane amount over them, can be paid off even faster than the loan amount with our funds, and is family-ready.A Tesla loses 36-39% in 3 years.  That‚Äôs not insanely fast, but it‚Äôs not a slow depreciation by any means.  Maybe the Tesla is family ready, but you know what else probably is?  Either of the two cars you already have.I‚Äôm sorry to be so blunt, but from every angle this looks like a really, really, really bad financial idea.  I‚Äôd love to get a really cool car too, but what I‚Äôm hearing is that you really want the car and are trying to rationalize what you know is a bad call.
i just bought 20k gme now when can i expect the stock price to soar? i will need the money back very soon so my wife doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs not there. i will surprise her with a tesla soon :)
Too late, all my tesla promises are gone
is this the free Tesla line?
If daddy Elon saves us I will invest winnings into Tesla

Those tesla calls will print for suohh fuck they expire in 2 hours
So confident I preordered a Tesla.
I just preordered my Tesla. Imma need help paying it off.
Year is 2023, somewhere in LA. GME share price is 1,932,420.69. Two guys covered in rocket emoji and gme tattoos are stuck in traffic in their green Tesla model GME. Homeless man approaches them and tells them a story how he was hedge fund manager and shorted gme. He tells them he just need 1 last share to close his position and start a new life. Two dudes with tattoos look at each other, and tell homeless man that it's against the law to sell GME shares. They drive into sunset in their rocket shaped(or dick shaped, who knows?) car into sunset to trade in Cyberpunk2077 for 27 cents at GameStop nearby. &amp#x200BFuck i might be too high to english properly right now.
Okay I‚Äôm gonna give you some non financial advisor comments:If it can rise from 40 to 180 after a few weeks of absolute decline and shit, then even if this doesn‚Äôt rise next week, it will get back to the 100s (and perhaps beyond, again). Use the fall to average down, and believe in the stock. You wouldn‚Äôt make 100% gains overnight off of Apple, Tesla, etc so why are you so nervous and shitting the pants when GME only increases by a few %, or drops? I know it‚Äôs exciting to think of all the money you could make, and then gambling everything you own, but doing shit like that is only going to make you eventually sell at a huge loss and then FOMO back in when we go up. Just chill. Imagine it‚Äôs a savings accountWe got this üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
I'm a doctor and here is some medical advice for those of you struggling with heart conditions:  a) Like this Stonk. Buy this Stonk.  b) Hold the damn line.  c) Diamond Hands will get you a new, Tesla Heart
I‚Äôve been reading up on this a lot and there seems to be a good consensus that once GME is listed on the S&ampP 500 the stock will Rocket, similar to Tesla... I‚Äôm just an ü¶ç though, do your own research. In the meantime this ü¶ç buy more.
Ah the death whale. Very rare. Think I'll get a blue Tesla
Just sold 1 share of Tesla...had about $1060 to spend...bought $1060 more baby!!! Still buying Thanks for the sale fuckers!!
March 2020: man trades 4 GME shares for pizzaMarch 2021: man trades 4 GME shares for Tesla model 3
Elon start the squeeze and we‚Äôll all buy a Tesla win win
Remember when papa Elon dropped all the hints that they were buying a certain asset?His tweets this past day is about GameStop... He's the secret buyer yesterday!(1) He tweeted about the moon(2) he tweeted about not judging a book by it's cover ( GameStop seems bad to the unacquainted)(3) Tesla ain't doing great. GME goes the opposite direction of the stock market. This is a hedge.(4) he tweeted about meta4 (trading app) and the books... the order books...  (5) he also tweeted "Do androids dream of D?" Android = Robot = A.I. = Hedgie ALgos

Elon stop watching just tweet already. Imagine how many Tesla you‚Äôll sell thanks to us.
If GME hits 400 today I'll buy a hooker a Tesla
Sold all my Tesla and just doubled down my position on gme, we need our asses on the MOON!
Elon, listen. We both know that you hate short sellers, and for good reason. We know for sure there is naked shorting happening in the market. GameStop and Tesla are suffering from it. You can end naked short selling forever, today. You can probably even triple up your investment at the same time. $2-4bil into GME today and all the corruption at the SEC and DTCC and market makers and hedge funds comes to light. No one will be able to hide in the shadows anymore. I know this is far fetched. But we need an activist. Or better some like yourself that is well funded with an axe to grind. Alternatively, just buy the whole fucking thing. Let RC and team run it. Re-IPO in 4-5 years and for sure triple up. üöÄ
if father Elon help us I'm going to buy only Tesla for the rest of my life
If you‚Äôre waiting for dips go buy Apple or Tesla instead. If you keep buying and selling GME you‚Äôre just making it more difficult for the stock to take off
Everyone tweet Elon to buy one share and post a screenshot, for real how many of us will buy a Tesla if we reach $1K plus üíéü¶çüöÄv

I think his primary impact has been to disrupt several import industries, especially space and automobiles. SpaceX was the first to land rockets back on Earth, and Tesla basically created ‚Äî or at least jump-started ‚Äî the current rising EV market.*Unfortunately* much of this has been accomplished by exploiting his employees, especially Tesla factory workers, and pulling shit like trying to downplay COVID-19 because he didn't want to slow down production.I'm also of the camp that believes it's impossible to become the richest man on the planet without a healthy dose of labor exploitation, so there may also be a lot that we don't really know about.
What color Tesla y‚Äôall buying
Today is our day. I woke up with the thought that my wife's boyfriend drives a piece of shit 1992 Honda Civic. If you guys take me to the moon today, I'm buying him a Tesla. If I go bankrupt my wife will divorce me and probably marry him, so either way today he wins. Side note: Holding 100 shares at $122 avg. LETS GO TO THE FUCKING MOON APES
I sold all the other stocks I had in nvidia, Tesla, square to buy more GME.

DADDY MUSK PLS TWEET ALL TENDIES FOR TESLA
If it hits 700k, I will buy a Tesla rocket, not a car.
Hahahah imagine this thing hitting 700k in 1 month. Im afraid i would paper hands far before 700k, but maybe ill hold onto my last share forever. But you have my word, if 700k comes i will sell my last share and order you any tesla you want
Man, I only have 4.4 bloody shares in Australia, need to hit 100k for a tesla üíéüôå
If this hits 700k and i actually hold my 100 shares till then ill buy you a tesla
I admit to buy a Tesla when the price hits 1500$ per share
Don't forget to buy tesla and SPY call options with your tendies after the squooze this is not financial advice
Tesla already down 5%. I‚Äôm gonna delete the Schwab app and come back in 2 weeks

"Sir we'll take your Tesla if you pay us $1,000"
She kisses me as I roll over for the fifth time is the last half hour. I pretend to sleep and she gets up to go to the bathroom. Out of the corner of my eye, I spy her naked body in the moonlight and for the first time I notice signs of aging. This week was hard for both of us, and it shows, but god damn is she still beautiful. I roll over once again and grab my phone to check futures. Nasdaq is down another percent. I swear under my breath and bite down on my hand just to feel something. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry love, did I wake you?‚Äù I look up and she‚Äôs standing there. ‚ÄúNono, I wasn‚Äôt asleep.‚Äù I say. She smiles, puts on her glasses and snuggles up close to me in bed. ‚ÄúI can tell something is up, do you want to talk about it?‚Äù She eyes my phone and let‚Äôs out a giggle.I meet her gaze ‚ÄúCathie are you ok? I‚Äôm worried about you. Your trades aren‚Äôt making sense. Why on earth are you selling apple, and why do you keep buying Tesla? The rising treasury yields are going to slaughter your fund.‚ÄùHer face changes, and suddenly she seems very serious. Her eyes glaze over and my heartbeat quickens. She reaches bellow the covers and I let out a yelp as she tugs violently on my balls.  Asserting her dominance, she leans in close to my ear and whispers ‚ÄúWe buy the dip f a g g o t‚Äù. My phone falls to the floor as she climbs on top of me like a hungry animal.
God, I hope Tesla keeps dipping. I am going to buy the fuck out of it. Don‚Äôt complain about tech stocks. Take advantage of the fucking dips to hell.
If I was getting a new Tesla this week, and their stock was going down like that, I wouldn't be as excited as if I was getting a new Tesla and the stock was on a high.
I remember I bought the top of Tesla in September (490). Was down 40% in a few days and couldn't sleep. It sucked for a few months but I held. Imagine if I sold at 320. If your account is fuk and you're long literally just don't look, the world isn't ending here
Look at Tesla...
That's would be hilarious and if tesla is still red I'd put all my winnings into them !!!!
üöÄüíé Math time: Poverty simpleton = you. Using GME as a casino = endless hookers and a Tesla. Who‚Äôs the retard for not buying GME?
Gather round children, I have a story to tell. On feb 9 i bought 4 Tesla calls. They were 11,000 each today they are worth 3,000. I have 4 of them I am big duck ü¶Ü

Someone wants a tesla
if $gme hits 800 tomorrow i‚Äôll buy a tesla and ask my crush out in it. if i don‚Äôt do it i‚Äôll gladly get banned. mark my words.
In a few days, you can walk to a tesla dealership and trade 1 share of GME for one tesla.
I sold my Tesla Puts yesterday. I suck at predicting this random number generator.
My profits in GME went from Tesla 3 to a used Toyota Corolla from like 10 years ago to a brand new Corolla. &amp#x200BWe getting there.
Will add more Tesla tomorrow
So company valuation is actually going to matter in this market? That's no fun. Rip Tesla.
selling my worthless Tesla stocks to go all in with GME tomorrow morning.
Tesla 420 isn‚Äôt a meme
Buy a Tesla with FSD and write it off against your taxes as a business write off to be a Robotaxi üòÇThis works especially well if Tesla gets the $7,000 Federal Tax Credit
Can‚Äôt wait to watch Tesla YouTube shills and scammers explain why this drop is a good thing for Tesla
Unfortunately multiple clearing houses and brokers already stepped in and stopped the real short squeeze from happening in January by supposedly demanding something like 300% on their current positions. My exit strategy is - I dont want to have to work my part time job next year while Im in my final year of college. Ill sell for whatever price I feel is right for that to happen.Also, you have too much faith in your government. They didnt step in during the 2008 financial crisis, they didnt step in when Tesla shares rocketed and put a large dent in hedge funds pockets, why would they decide to step in now? After all, we arent doing anything wrong. We arent the ones who shorted 140% of a stock. If you play by the rules of the book - they have to buy back the shares that they shorted at some point. To a certain degree the retail investor has the power to set that price, but moreso the large institutions such as blackrock that hold a majority of the float will also want to maximise profits.
If Elon tweets about GME and it rockets, I'll buy everyone in my family a Tesla
I put my life savings into Tesla over the week and am down a metric piss load. About 80% with no way out now.I have, 2/26/21 700c    And 3/19/21 815c, 890c,930c,1000c,1100cHow screwed am I?
Or just announce that Tesla will accept GME shares as payment for their products.
Any of you fucks that are long on GME like me.... this has gotta get ur dick hard. Ryan Cohen is our CEO he just kicked an old white boomer off payroll for some young Indian chick(which gets the medias dick hard), and our stock is at 100 right now. I'm calling GME the next chewy possibly the next Tesla.
He has been warning of a bubble in tesla for a year now. While he is righ I think takes no genius to see it. And on Ark its not necessarily a problem. They could unload smaller cap companies slower while they unload bigger cap companies quicker so it's not that bad I am sure they are more than capable to have a solid unloading plan in case of a crash. (I have no positions in any of the stocks disscused)
\-35k today, biggest loss in amzn and teslaass hurts so much im already numb, cant even feel it
nobody cares no more about TESLA, APPLE, MICROSOFT, AMAZON, PLUG, NIO etc....but GME and AMC ...look at the volumes....so without buying restrictions should be just one way....UP.
If Apple could announce a car deal with tesla today that would be great for me.
Group of paperhands are panick selling. Look at the volume it's only $2 million. This is not a short attack. A lot of gamblers here on wsb who are aiming to make 100% each day. If the stocks drops from 50% to 20% they start to bad mouth talking about the stock and start crying here. Most of them will never make money. They are gamblers who buy stocks with the hope to make 100% every day and if they see a drop in price they dump it and went short to get squeezed.Outside GME all my stocks are in red today. Tesla, Amd, Zoom, Pinterest and Shopify. Gamestop is the only stock in my portfolio what closed green. And not 1% or 2% but 19%. But because we saw 50% and it dropped back to 19% it looks like we are in a downtrend. Reality is we are in a uptrend and we are already up more then 120% since yesterday.
nobody cares no more about TESLA, APPLE, MICROSOFT, AMAZON, PLUG, NIO etc....but GME and AMC ...look at the volumes....so without buying restrictions should be just one way....UP

Hoping Tesla goes up a little so I can exit it - drove one for the first time yesterday and it was so stupid.  I could make fart noises with the giant panel.  That‚Äôs fucking dumb and I‚Äôm selling because of it.
&gt Cathie Wood said that in a downturn she would sell liquid holdings, like ARK‚Äôs Tesla and Roku, to buy and support illiquid holdings I understand trying to reassure investors, but telling everyone what the canary in the coal mine would be doesn't seem like the route I would take.

I sold tesla and bought gme for it
If this hits $800 I‚Äôll buy a Tesla with a TENDIE license plate.
Please God I just want to have a Tesla
Sold the rest of my Tesla and someOther stocks to buy the dip.
100%. My crystal ball is cloudy so I'm not going to try and finesse this week's drawdowns - it just is what it is and I'll take my medicine. While certain tech stocks have probably become overheated (looking at you, Tesla), the macroeconomy (domestic+international) is on firm footing, employment is improving, productivity is strong, supply chains are getting back on track, and even with a higher 10yr, equities should continue to be a far more attractive place to deploy one's money. I think most of what we've seen this week is fear, untethered to any material change in the marketplace. It sucks to end a week down 7% or wherever you may be, but it happens. There's good reason to believe '21 will be a strong year in the market.
my sell point is at $69420.69.  melvin needs to buy me one whole tesla.
Sold all of my tesla for GME. Already recovered a good chunk of my losses from riding Tesla down. Let's go!
I can't imagine the balls it takes to short this stock. Probably the same ignorant think tank that thought shorting Tesla last year was a good idea.
They said I didn't buy Apple stocks, Amazon stocks and Tesla stocks. Now they will miss Gamestop.
Let‚Äôs get GameStop to shoot pass Tesla, then everyone will dump Tesla and autist into GMEMoon bananas! Position 125 @ $61
My friend and I both got Tesla in 2019. He paper hand bitched out during the drop. Don't be like my friendü§£
Can i ride his Tesla inside the rocket????
I bought myself a Tesla with the last tendies. It‚Äôs my moms birthday on Sunday. Plz more tendies for my mom Tesla GME.
THE ONLY THING MELVIN COVERED WAS THE PRICE OF MY NEW FUCKING TESLA
ABout to sell all my Tesla and dump on GME.
Lmfaooo "My SpaceX program is sending a tesla to the moon. And you know what's in that car? FUCKING GME, BABY."
I just need to be able to afford a Tesla so my wife can get safely to her boyfriends house.
good call (literally lol) anyway!unfortunately in germany we do not have options.or lets say my broker does not offer them for gme . just for some big stocks like tesla
My brain is like a freshly waxed Tesla. Too smooth to get the joke
Get GME to 200+ so I can buy a Tesla and install the Gamestop app on it üöÄüöÄ
Just sold some Tesla to jump on some GME. #femaletraders üíÉüèæ ü§öüèæüíé‚úãüèæ (is that how yall say it ü§£)
Should I sell Tesla at a loss to put more into GME? hnnnnng tough
If GME hits 200+ I‚Äôll buy you dinner + Tesla model 3
If GME hits 7k a share ill post a pic of me wearing the red Tesla short shorts (women's small). I don't have enough karma to make a post
Moon AMC need to recover from Tesla today lol
Just bought 30 shares. What color Tesla should I buy ?
I sold my discount Tesla shares for this, GME MOON
Bought 35 shares. Iys all I couod afford,  sold all my tesla, apple, and zomedica. Hopin it helps!
I was gonna sell this morning, it would be enough to bring my portfolio to even numbers this year, I got fucked on tesla and weed, but no, this is just the beginning. I bought at 50$/ share, and it actually held there for fucking weeks. I have 4 shares so it would only amount to a 200$ loss, so fuck it, I'm riding this rocket to 100k
Tesla buys $1B worth of $GME for next quarters profits. Elons next big brain play.
If it hits 1000 im buying a tesla and a used game from my local gamestop
The ppl complaining about the Arks dumping, do you not understand it‚Äôs literally because everyone in here is taking all of their money out of them and Tesla to buy GME and AMC??
Tesla GUH
10k to charity.Tesla model 3 for me.Full on sleeve tattoo - which will of course have tribute to wsb, apes, and dfv.If we see 10k.
No air conditioning in the base version? People who buy this Fisher Price automobile wouldn‚Äôt buy a Tesla in the first place.
3 theories ive seen1) chamath went hard into gme, he said he was gonna fuck up some shit in twitter.2) elon bought bitchc0in driving price up, sold it for profits and dumped the gains into gme for revenge against hedgefunds shorting tesla. huge price fluctuations.3) dude that was fired from gme was dealing with hedgefunds to offer more shares, cohen got him ousted so hedgefunds had to fucking cover now. Monday was them dumping everything to get ready to cover gme.
Congrats GME gang, I missed the rocket this time as I was planning on jumping in at my original 39.30 for old times sake and you took off without me!For the rest of us, Powell said no changes until 2023 and Johnson &amp Johnson one shot vaccine expected to be approved this Friday, put your money where you expect those tasty GME tendies will returnTLDR üåàüêª R fuk and Tesla and Corn go üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
What color/model Tesla are y'all getting?
Those 1.4m or so shares borrowed yesterday is chicken scratch.Papa E can buy that shit up with the change dropped underneath the seat of his tesla...Unless he‚Äôs too chicken shit to do it.
Conspiracy theoryEver since the GME situation started tesla has been hemorrhaging. There is more money to be made shorting tesla than they lose by letting GME spike. What if they purposely are running up GME so all the retards that blindly inflate Tesla are distracted again and they can short the fuck out of Tesla some more?Like since the whole thing started Tesla has lost almost 100B in value, and it is all 100% because Tesla buyers became GME buyers.
Cramer with a straight face really said to buy fractional shares of Tesla to become wealthy instead of GME. Fucking ü§°
Tesla $757 in Germany! GME $150, AMC $11.  Only 3 stocks that matter for the foreseeable future!
Anyone else started picking out there new tesla? Or lambo?
Set aside some money you wont miss. It can be 100 bucks, 50, hell, 20 bucks. Go to a broker that's worth a shit (Vanguard and Fidelity tend to be treated as the only two with an ethical bone in their body), put that money into it and throw the money around on small stocks. Unfortunately you missed what was probably the best opportunity to get your foot in the door since the Great Recession by not investing in 2020 / 2019. Ford for 4.50 a share, Blizzard Activision for 50, Tesla for less than 90,  etc etc etc. Like, if you want a really safe, mature investment strategy, put money into your 401k and an IRA. Year over year they tend to out perform targeted investing for the simple fact that their investment strategy is betting on the entire market instead of individual stocks. If you have the stomach for direct investing, understand that what's happening right now ranges from unusual to unprecedented, and understand the notion that you. do. not. invest. money. you. will. miss. open a brokerage account. Right now I'm just kicking myself for missing GME, twice now.
Just told Elon we will check on his tesla when we fly past it to the moon.
I went to a Tesla dealership today to do a little dream shopping. I think I‚Äôm gonna reserve a cyber truck üê∏üç¶
College retard here. Crashed my car a couple weeks ago on the snow. Haven‚Äôt told my mom yet. Gonna drop it on her and every dollar she gives me to fix the car I‚Äôm putting into GME and buying a fucking Tesla üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I told one of my friends to sell tesla and get into gme. She laughed, i laughed, then I gained 3 times my initial investment in one day.
wasnt Tesla the original meme stock? Jimmy Chill was shytting on Tesla for the past 5 years. Now, he is recommending it. What a fucking Douche
I'll buy a tesla if Elon tweets about GME. Don't let me down daddy Elon.
(reposting because auto-mod is a toast)Elon Musk bought [I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT HE ADDED TO THE BALANCE SHEET], took profits, and is dumping it into GME.Disclaimer: I did not take LSD and I do not work for Tesla.Obviously, this cannot be categorized as any type of advice.
I'll buy a tesla if Elon musk tweets about gme again.
Easy, you buy him a Tesla too so he'll shut the fuck up and steal your wife's boyfriend for yourself üòú
Honestly guys, all these new EVs coming to market won't be much of a competition for Tesla. üü¢Tesla is years ahead of everyone when it comes to EV manufacturing üü¢years ahead of competition in EV tech üü¢decades ahead of everyone in self driving tech. Billions of miles of data and dedicated hardware.üü¢Tesla dedicated charging stations üü¢last but not least, Elon Musk Did I miss anything? I'm sure I did
I got fucked over on cciv!!! I got fucked over on tesla!!! My account is bleeding red! Gme to the mother fucking moon!
U wot? The turbo S and the 765LT have been benched as fast as a 2.2 0-60. And also those 2 cars aren't even dedicated straight line cars. As blistering fast as they are in a straight line, its not their party trick. The 765LT is a dedicated track car and the turbo S is a daily drivable supercar and autobahn shredderEVs have incredible acceleration down low, but they aren't as potent at high speeds. From 200 to 300 kmh a turbo S would eat a tesla model S alive. And EVs (except rimac) currently suck at cornering. They're waaaay too heavyTesla fan boyisms aside you cant in the right mind think a model S is a better performance car than a Turbo S or a 765LT...
I bought fucking puts on Tesla. FUCK MY LIFE
My 5.7 shares will hopefully make be debt-free from student loans forever.~~If~~ When it goes past the moon, I‚Äôll buy a Tesla as a thank you to Papa Elon
There on the screen is fucking Tesla lmao. It is a different kind of hype,  seemingly bubble stock and he praises it and downtalks GME lmao
I‚Äôm taking my Tesla and moving it to GME
I lost $3k on a Tesla call last year, which was the first and last option I ever played. Thought it was supposed to be a double your money button ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
So we know gamestop is the gamestop of video games, Tesla is the gamestop of cars, and Blackberry is the gamestop of phones, but we need to be on the lookout for new gamestops. Who is the gamestop of shrimp? Find the gamestop of shrimp and you'll have found your fortune
Should I sell my .5 Tesla and Yolo it on gme for shits and giggles? I wanna be a retard ü¶ßü¶ç

The day is February 25th 2021. You remember it like it was yesterday. GME broke an all time record and soared to a whopping 1.5k a share. You look at the chart the day before and realize, you lost a new Tesla. I stand strong with my 3 shares, and I will wake up precisely at 8:45 am tomorrow promptly to Ready to Die by the Notorious B.I.G. Because where ever GME lands tomorrow, I am ready to go with itüíéüôåüèª

Hope I can get a Tesla with my gme gains soon
Sitting here sad that I didn‚Äôt play game stonk, but full well knowing I was never going to get involved with it. Still sucks, but GRATS to you winners. Hope this thing goes bat shit tomorrow and y‚Äôall have tendies to buy a Tesla and donate to your favorite charity
I put the DP on the Tesla Roadster...   Im all about the rumble...  but those numbers have me stuck...  plus its Elon...  I want air thrusters behind the license plate.
How am I going to explain my new Tesla to my wife‚Äôs boyfriend?
I was able to afford a down payment in a house with gme round 1.Round 2 I‚Äôm looking for a Tesla
Cramer doing his best to keep the system from crashing. He's now reduced to telling people to buy Tesla as a safe stock.
Soon you can laugh at them while they clean your tesla
Tesla is on there which makes the point fucking moot because you damn sure didn't say that 2 years ago.
How cool would it be if papa Elon announced some sort of partnership with Gamestop for the games that they put in a Tesla. Or at a minimum names his next car the "Model-Stonk"
I don‚Äôt want them to die before buying a Tesla with GME gains ):
I'm so glad that I tripled down on my shares on Monday to bring my cost average down from 217 to 97. I'm really salty that I didn't follow my instinct and sell tesla to put another 6k into GME though
Maybe they can buy a Tesla with the gme gains
If this shit hits $1000 ill buy a fucking tesla and prove it.
GME goes up and people yell to buy AMC and BB. Makes no fucking sense. Might as well buy tesla
8am: New non boomer named CFO 9am: RC named CEO 9:30am: Tesla announces partnership with GME

the main reason why gme &amp every other meme stock is popping up is because of the ark fund buying Tesla‚Äôs dip, Tesla was supposed to crash so all the hedge funds boosted their short percentage on Tesla so the ark fund basically copied the gme blueprint. That‚Äôs why Tesla blew up today, if that fund holds on long enough every other meme stock has to basically ‚Äúlet loose‚Äù because now the hedge funds have to cover Tesla, which will lead Tesla to go even higher but in all honesty if Tesla,gme, amc, etc all spike tomorrow then the market will most likely crash

The year is 2031. I get on my GameStop airlines flight departing from new GameStop and landing on los GameStop, as I drive my Tesla home. As soon as I get home I hop into my pool and once I get out my son GameStop The Third asks me about my "Deep Fucking Value" tattoo on my lower back. I look him deep in the eyes and tell him "Where he goes, I go, if he holds the line, I'm standing there right next to him."
gamestop to $400 tomorrow, United to $100, Tesla to $900. scared money don't make money nerds
I have .06 shares in GME, what color Tesla should I buy?
Wtf is that supposed to mean??Edit: I'm actually really pissed off about that comment would any of them say that about tesla?! while they have all their dirty hands in it. Don't think so. Fucking melon.
People are reading way too much into it-- this is literally all it is. Ark has the dry powder to buy Tesla now because they trimmed it like crazy on the way up. It's basically algorithmic -- buy low, sell high, buy low again, keeping the exposure at around 10%. She's mentioned that she gets like 100bps of additional performance based on trading the ups and downs
If Elon buys in and this hits 1000, I will buy an actual frog a Tesla and a McDonald's ice cream cone.
Y‚Äôall be donating switches from your Tesla while DFV is handing out Lambos to Martian Kids.
My neighbor let me drive his 2014 S. I've always wanted a tesla, but that's what made me pull the trigger. To get into a 2014 and realize it makes the technology in wife's top of the line 2019 Mazda look ancient. I do wish it had a HUD and ventilated seats though, I'll miss those.
Sure. Can you predict the future please and tell us when to short Tesla?
Fast charging the Bolt isn‚Äôt much good without available chargers. Completely impractical for a Bolt to be anything but an urban commuter car until there‚Äôs a charging network. Tesla‚Äôs charging network is years ahead and *still* makes owning a Tesla impractical for large swaths if the US. EA has some long, thin routes of chargers but is still inadequate for most. If Tesla solves self driving in next 5 years then GM is really screwed because the Bolt is not future proofed for self driving. Tesla is so far behind promised dates that skepticism is warranted. But if they do it, it‚Äôs backward compatible to nearly every tesla on the road. Offer it as a subscription (which tesla has said it will do) and the used market for Teslas will shine at the expense of things like a new Bolt. Why isn‚Äôt GM putting Cadillac Supercruise hardware in every car?You also didn‚Äôt factor in the problem of dealer laws. GM has to sell through dealers. Dealers don‚Äôt make money selling cars they make money servicing cars. EVs have significantly lower service costs and pushing a sale requires shitting on gasoline cars. Dealers are not going to sell the Bolt with any vigor until they make most of their money from EVs and not gasoline cars. That‚Äôs going to be a long ways away. And even then you‚Äôve got this middle man taking a cut in every sale. A middle man that doesn‚Äôt know Jack about EVs or how to sell them (because they don‚Äôt really want to). Then there‚Äôs the casting and structural battery packs from Tesla no one else is doing. If Tesla is Apple and GM and Ford are taking the Android approach to EVs, buying batteries and motors and system software off the shelf, Tesla is a couple years from offering an equivalent to the iPhone SE, trickle down technology that‚Äôs more affordable. Maybe the SE doesn‚Äôt match a flagship Samsung Android but it has other things going for it like full iOS experience and iCloud integration. Absent major adjustments by legacies to their design and engineering methodology it‚Äôs possible (perhaps likely) by 2030 Tesla can offer a better experience at a cheaper price than GM in terms of everyday consumer cars. Teslas are luxury now because of price, just like the iPhone, but it won‚Äôt stay that way forever. I think the EV revolution will bring several winners and GM is likely one. I just think you‚Äôre underestimating the headwinds they face and the ability of upstarts to interfere. You gotta think at least one major manufacturer will suffer the fate of RIM/Blackberry.
I originally bought Tesla months ago at $342 and sold due to the GME hype:(
If Tesla wins autonomous race it will explode... lots of competition now though
Elon I know you can see me. If you buy GME and we rocket I‚Äôll buy a Tesla, everyone wins üöÄ
You can short Tesla profitability due to its volatility this is dumb. It was at like 860 and hit a low of like 690 in a week period
Fair point lol. I can‚Äôt tell you how many shares of Tesla I bought at $420 because I thought it was a fun number...
Sold Tesla and bought 50 more shares
I sold right around $800 before the dip, won't be rebuying as I used the trendies to get a model 3. Currently at Tesla waiting for pick up.
Tesla's real value that most people discount is the part they play in beyond Earth should SpaceX succeed with Starship. Everyone continues to treat the company as a stand alone entity that is in the car market. That's wrong and too short sighted.Tesla takes up *most* of Elon's time, with Boring, Neuralink and SpaceX taking up the rest SpaceX being the 2nd order in that list. Every Elon does and I mean ***everything*** is for Mars only. He has gone on record that he would like to die as an old man on Mars. So when you look at Tesla's market position and the things it does, and are looking to invest in said company, you need to do your DD with how it matters *for* Mars.Earth is literally, to excuse the pun, a vehicle, to achieve his Mars ambition. So the market evaluation of this and that compared to Toyota or Ford or GM or whatever, in my book, is wholly *irrelevant.* Can any of those companies retool their production lines to take existing cars, modify the design 20-25% and be able to punt them to the Moon or Mars? Can those vehicle operate in a foreign environment at scale? If yes? They matter in this conversation. If no, they don't matter nearly as much as anyone thinks.Also, most of the big institutions holding Tesla are holding Tesla long. Additionally, the majority of retail Tesla holders are almost entirely long positions. Finally, and most importantly, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy maiden launch put Elon's cherry red roadster into a 100 million year orbit around the sun. The car was mostly unmodified. It ran for 14-18 hours sending back a 1080p livestream from orbit and beyond Earth orbit for everyone to see.Most will see this and dismiss it as a stunt, while other players will look and this and say "holy shit, Tesla vehicles can function in hard vacuum with zero modification."SpaceX already uses Tesla car batteries and power train motors for their Starship development platform, internal electricals, and some of the actuators on the prototype vessel. It's almost guaranteed then that SpaceX will contract Tesla downstream for batteries, hvac, and autonomous driving capabilities for rovers and other vehicles for Moon/Mars.And all of Tesla's on planet investments will carry over off world seamlessly. When 99% of all vehicles on the Moon or Mars are Tesla. The future generations won't care about Ford or GM or Toyota.
Either a Tesla Roadster fully decked out or Foodstamps for me üöÄüöÄüöÄüôåüíéüôåüíéüôå
 The main reason I'm investing into GME is because I'm very young and I'm looking in the far future. If Gamestop utilizes its money in the most efficient possible ways, something highly likely with Cohen's takeover, it will become a trillion dollar company exceeding even Tesla.After GME will have finished scaling and dominating the gaming e-commerce, computer market, it will move on to AI. After AI, electric vehicles are not far off the horizon. Even with the massive market of competition, even NIO and TESLA and Lucid will have to bend to the godliness of the GME robotaxi.I won't be all that surprised if GME moves into the cybersecurity industry and secures a spot as the top company. Easily can they surpass the likes of Palantir. A study in 2020 provides that there was an estimated 2.1 billion active gamers in the whole world. This is a large enough sample size by which GME cyber-solutions can innovate systems that procure accurate data-gathering.I believe GME also has a place in the beetcoin industry. As their cybersecurity sector has produced the most advanced technology available, they will be able to safeguard thebeetcoin assets of--more than just boomer big banks like the one labelled on your credit card (if you don't have a trash credit score like I expect you to have)--but the general populace. Their ro(bl0ckschain) technologies, I surmise, will be of the latest update.And don't even get me started on space travel. With the level of simulation pulled off by future GME machinery that simulates space travel, safety mechanisms--and what ever is required in order to educate the populace on the unknown, the profitability will scale massively.This is only the begin.Can't stop, won't stop, gamestop.
**IS TESLA A BUY RN???**
Sold some Tesla shares. Bought AMC and GME
Lol, just wait until CNBC sees this and then claims NK is manipulating Tesla stocks.
Conventional banks are terrible. 6-8 eur comission on average for any transaction, meaning that unless you're trading in the thousands it's just not worth it.Degiro seems much better (just a tiny amount of money for operation), but weirdly only international stocks are affordable, Spanish ones are expensive as hell. And they won't do fractional stocks, which makes impossible for poor people to invest in things like Amazon or Tesla.
Elon, when this moons I‚Äôm buying a Tesla. Help us along, yeah?
Man I can‚Äôt wait for GME to buy me my Tesla, lick my fucking balls you hedge fund sacks of shit.
When will Tesla shorts learn?
Tesla cars are the only ones who will be able to use the underground tunnels, charging stations... and go into space.I'm in
how so? Ark has been invested in Tesla for a long time, like pre 2020. She won many rounds already
BREAKING: Tesla buys $7 billion worth of tickets to trade at the fair. Musk was quoted as saying ‚ÄúI know there‚Äôs no fair right now but think how cool it will be if there ever is one again, plus that‚Äôs only 1% of our valuation, who cares?‚Äù
Are you dumb? Everyone is watching this IPO, including hedgies. Its the Tesla of games.
Tesla has a couple of things in the pipeline that are game changing.1. Autonomous driving2. Ride sharing3. Tesla Solar/Power4. Tesla HVAC (happening 2021-2022)5. Tesla EV Jet (Elon has shown interest, but is too busy right now now to dedicate any time (so as one the upper level items start getting closed out, more time gets freed up form bottom items))6. Tesla has a materials research partnership with SpaceX (this has profound implications for the entire Tesla business in both directions)7. SpaceX *will* likely contract Tesla for off-world rovers and vehicles for Mars since Tesla's by nature can be modified to become hermetically sealed vehicles reasonably quickly. Additionally, when Tesla semis go online, repurposing them for Mars exploration would be "relatively" easy.Finally, Cathie Wood is DeepFuckingValue for Tesla. Her bet thus far hasn't been wrong, no reason not to double her position.

She sold Tesla when it was 800-900. Buying back when it drop to 650-700. Sounds about right
Elon gonna tie Tesla stock to a space X falcon heavy rocket and launch that puppy straight past the moon and into the face of Mars üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Problem is timing it. This could go on for quite a while, another 4 years etc. The market economy is actually dead because it's now not being driven by fundamentals  but actually by how much money and credit is being extended.Tesla might as well just buy the shares on the DOW because it's more profitable than making real things... bonkers.
What? Lucid Motors is valued at 24 billion and will release one Luxus Car this year.   Volkswagen already has 13% market share for EV on top of being one of the biggest producers of cars worldwide with sales in the tens of millions of cars and it stands at 90 billion.   That's totally not a bubble ^^^/s.   And Tesla, with double the market share in EV than VW, yet only a fraction of a market share for all vehicles is valued very fairly at 700 billion.
Sooo buy ARK and Tesla?
Gonna buy my first stonks other than GME which I‚Äôm on -80% on now. 37k split like this * 20% Apple* 20% Disney* 10% PayPal * 15% Tesla* 10% AMD* 5% PLTRRest is for plays later. Nice to join you all
Just some back of the envelope drooling here. At 8k/share it's an 8 trillion dollar company. In that case, at a 7% discount rate, it needs to make 560 billion dollars in profit each year, every year, or make more than that each year starting from some year in the future.So she's betting they can actually make autonomy work, she's betting they can produce cars orders of magnitude faster than they do today, and she's betting that Tesla will have a monopoly on autonomous cars for a long-ass while, and she's betting that regulators will believe Tesla's tech is safe, while the other carmakers are at least years away from being ready with their own autonomy tech.All of the above have to be true simultaneously for her bet to make any sense right?
Lmao these fucking morons. I only submit Tesla gif content, and I am by FAR the most prolific Tesla gif creator, when the stock goes big up or big down. Otherwise, there‚Äôs no fun content for a gif. Success and failure are my muse. Who the fuck upvotes my gifs during doldrums? Big hint: nobody. Go see my profile. Dozens of gifs with like 250 updoots but a few with 10k or so (pre-GME that was **big**). Tldr these fucking idiots don‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs the other way around. Tesla starts moving and gifs are created
Tesla already at 730 premarket lol
Buy Tesla. Duh.Or Palantir.Or ARKK.Only concern, stocks can do that sideways thing for 10-20 years... So keep on investing as even in a pretty flat market that will make you profits. Then one day the market will take off again.
So $TESLA is WSB gold and $PLTR is silver?
Rip that guy who posted he shorted tesla
Is it possible that she might know Tesla plans for the future? Maybe she does have information regarding new products and stuff that haven't been announced yet. Or, maybe she added the shares in order to balance the whole thing.
Her price target is like 8k/share per a recent interview. She is assuming Tesla will start an autonomous ride hailing service
Cnn: " reddit comments drive tesla stock more than fundamentals "  k cool.Also cnn: Keith gill is a monster manipulater through reddit comments
There‚Äôs also the guy who spent a grand or so on Tesla $6p thinking he was buying $600p lol
Rip to the guy who went all in on $500P for Tesla üòÇ
My move for today is to convince Lucid or Tesla to put a gaming console in every dashboard and merge with GME. This will elimate most deaths caused from accidents as everyone will be sitting still at traffic lights playing video games not going anywhere.
Imagine sleeping in yesterday with Tesla puts.
Imagine waking up and looking at your Tesla puts
smuckers will be bigger than tesla by the end of 2021 mark my words boys
Tesla mooning at open
Always wait 48 hrs. First day always goes down. Google, Tesla, Facebook, every company has their stock go down day 1.
Tesla powerrrr
So ARK buys TSLA, while selling AMZN, apple and Goog.My god, this woman really thinks the moat on Tesla is stronger than the most of the Fangman.Truly "Jesus take the wheel" type thinking.
If Tesla ends at $800+ today I'll suck Elon off at gun point
My $630 Tesla calls are gonna print so hard. God am I horny
There use to be a lot of good tips here. I‚Äôve been following Shopify here since it was under 30, AMD since  some asshole yolod 30k of CC debt at 8/share, and I remember when people were talking about how Tesla is going to hit 200. Plays on Microsoft etc. now it‚Äôs like these shit penny stocks and some dream of some crappy gaming company on it last leg turning around. Don‚Äôt try and catch a falling knife. I learned that here and now all these tards are doing the opposite? Why? Bc hedge funds? Who gives a fuck about hedge funds we‚Äôre here to make some money and learn. This place isn‚Äôt about fighting the man. This place is about greed.
Tesla $900 end of week
Tesla $726.57 in Germany right now.
I can't lie, Tesla looking real good right now
Oh boy my tesla puts are absolutely fucked
Tesla hot on frankfurter   598.3 Euro equals727.47 United States Dollar
What about tesla jumping 700% this year?
I bought ARKK as an etf to diversify. Turns out I just bought preferred class A Tesla shares.
Just need Tesla to open above 700It‚Äôll probably open back down at 660 again
AMC IS FINANCING MY NEW TESLA LETS GO
‚ÄúThe vast majority of profits‚Äù This is misleading because Tesla is still ramping their production, they‚Äôre not very ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù yet. A minute percentage of their revenue is derived from the sale of carbon credits, and as the automotive industry pivots to EV, they‚Äôll sell even less of these credits. People that make this argument are being disingenuous at best, and absolutely clueless at worst.
Need Tesla be $780 by Friday. You can do it baby üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Tesla is a bitcoin ETF I thought?
If tesla hits 800 EOD, I‚Äôll donate $500 to khan academy.
I made enough in 2.5 hours today on tesla to pay off my mortgage/car/student debt. I'll definitely lose it all by friday, but what a rush
Once tesla hits 800 tomorrow you're all invited on my lamboyacht
Tesla at 630 was the easiest 40k I've made in my life
Mostly Tesla and EV stocks and spacs
Could be a good promo. I'm more intrigued by the fact that the upcoming Tesla models have gaming capabilities. A GameStop UI would be dope.
nobody:CNBC: Tesla crashed because there were less posts about TSLA on wsb
Have actually been in a meeting with Elon (with my boss, I was the note taker in the corner). Dude cares only about going to mars. Everything else is just a game to him or a means to an end, which is colonizing Mars. Tesla is just a way to fund his SpaceX mission to Mars. He could give a fuck less  about anything but his mission to Mars. Literally this is why the guy gets out of bed every morning.P. S. - His brother is working on vertical farming inside containers to feed the colony when they get to Mars. He is all in on colonizing Mars. Not passing judgement, but just don't expect him to care about anything that isn't a means to his end of colonizing Mars.
Buy Tesla calls
If Tesla closes above 800 tomorrow I‚Äôll eat an entire jar of mayonnaise. And I‚Äôm lactose intolerant.
I am probably going to buy a shit ton of Tesla tomorrow tbh
Tesla Model X is already on the way
But don't you get it? Elon cares about us! He's just like us little guys sticking it to the man. He make memes and anime jokes. ^^^^^^^^/sEdit: All jokes aside the people that work at Tesla (like designers and engineers etc.) are more deserving of the love and attention that Elon gets. Elon is just a good hype man.
Note to self - if tesla ever starts dumping get out of the market
Stupidest thing I did today? Bought puts on Tesla. Never bet against Tesla.
I would hold.  Tesla got ripped apart by Elon‚Äôs reckless tweets....  makes for better buying opp
&gt -Founded a VC firm called social capital based on investing in start-ups with positive world impacts. But then most of his executive council and co-founders abandoned the company and allegedly pointed their fingers at Chamath as the reason. Maybe he's great, but when everyone around says you're the problem it tends to be true.&ltSimilar things could be said about Elon in the early Tesla days
Dude!! Those Tesla calls will print!! Hail Elon!!
tesla
lmao, cathie bought more than 110$ million worth of tesla during todays dip. tomorrow we moon.
The thing is, he probably did this to squeeze the short sellers. I really wonder (but will not look it up) if some short sellers got screwed because of the run up to $380 that day. THAT would easily be worth 20mm to him. And THEN he found out for himself how toothless the SEC is. I wonder if tesla stock would be where it is today of he hadn't done what he did.
Cathie about to own TESLA lol
https://www.foxnews.com/auto/tesla-elon-musk-factory-reopens-california-coronavirus-tweet&gtElon Musk reopens Tesla factory closed by coronavirus: 'If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me'https://www.breitbart.com/news/musk-says-restarting-california-tesla-factory-defying-authorities/&gtMusk ‚Äòrestarting‚Äô California Tesla factory, defying authoritiesOr do you guys require blogs as sources here?
I'm going to quote exactly what you said:&gtAnd he actually earned it with viable products and services.Viable products and services are things people can use. Even do use. Guess what Amazon is good at.Musk's got his contribution to Paypal, and to Tesla which started looking like it's actually doing stuff rather than promising stuff in the last couple of years.SpaceX is still a pretty minor practical change from previous satellite launches. Starlink barely operates. Neuralink and Hyperloop don't at all.Yes, they have potential, but they're not "viable products and services" in the same way as something you've been using every day of the last decade of your life, *even though you apparently tried not to*.
Tesla could use GME stores as a lounge also. Stick some charging ports in the GME parking lot, turn the store into a lounge area
What color will my new shiny tesla be ü§£üò∂ü§°
&gt or malicious and willing to sacrifice others for his benefit.https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/cars/elon-musk-tesla-factory-tweet/index.html&gtTesla and Elon Musk reopen California facility, defying orders meant to stem coronavirus spread
Not so hard in a flying Tesla üåïüöÄ
WTF has neuralink and hyperloop accomplished? There‚Äôs literally nothing going on with those two projects. Def have to give credit for Tesla and SpaceX, but as of this moment in time Bezos transformation of the economy and creating this retail behemoth seems a bit more impressive.
Imagine being me selling Tesla at the bottom today only for it to immediately reboundü§°
I remember when people here only cared about whether they made money. Who gives a shit whose side he is on? All I care about is will my fucking tesla weeklies print.
Said he was taking tesla private at 420 a share, funding secured. Back when the share price was below that can't Remeber what it was trading for at the time. But it definitely skyrocketed after that tweet.
This. There wouldn't be Apple without Steve Jobs and there wouldn't be Tesla, nor SpaceX, likely not even PayPal without Elon Musk. Those scientists and engineers didn't magically materialize around them from thin air. Brilliant minds have always been here, but for large projects such as these you need an individual with a vision, self-drive to act upon it and make enough money for a company to survive in the process at least. And people like these are few and far between for some reason. They are deservedly in the spotlight, because they are leaders that made those projects a reality. Yes, those scientists and engineers did the vast majority of the "manual labor", but they wouldn't do it on their own, if somebody didn't brought them together, gave them a common direction and paid them for their work. I'm an engineer, but I don't understand this devaluing of leadership and management in the company that some people do, as if it is somehow less important. I'm talking about real management and leadership of course, not a human centipede of kinder-management sticking from the asses of their superiors in the corporate ladder of halfway disintegrated corporations (looking at you, IBM).
Sandy Munro sat in a Space X meeting, and said he was blown away by how much rocket science Musk knows. That Musk brought forth ideas only someone with deep knowledge of the science would know. A reason why Musk's companies own is because he knows what technology makes sense to lean into. Like when Tesla opted for cylindrical battery cells while every other car company went with pouches. He was called crazy by them.
For every good criticism of Elon Musk, there is a weak-ass comment like yours that makes the naysayers sound just as biased and close-minded as the fandom.The dude smoked weed on camera? Really, is that all you got? Besides, when did he take credit for the employees exactly? I know working for him sucks ass, but I've never heard or read him pretend it wasn't all a team effort, SpaceX or Tesla.
Looking into the various stocks more, that seems to be the case. The biggest thing on supply chain that I know of at the moment is metals, particularly those used in electronics. They can't pull enough our of the ground to keep up with demand at the moment. So tech, like Tesla, is falling because they have nothing to sell, and these mining companies are about to step up operations to meet demand, meaning more money.There's also the issue of interruptions in supply in south Asia due to the unrest in various countries. While that's not significant in the grand scheme, I'm sure people with billions to lose are adjusting their investments to account for that to some degree. The bigger issue is the first I stated. The second is more of a compounding issue.
That and the fact that Tesla is making moves to specifically get out of the foreign lithium industry, hardly a good comparison on their part.
If Tesla hits $850 eow, I‚Äôll drink my own piss
Bought pltr options and more Tesla ! Let‚Äôs go
Couldn‚Äôt handle the fact that he was going to be a leader on a company with more market cap than Tesla next week.
Hold spy all year or just buy a Tesla dip and make 14% in half a day. This market is fucked
Tesla was at $600 today. That‚Äôs pretty wild man
As far as stocks go, Tesla is a meme company, not a car company. (Elon's twitter being shut down would probably tank the stock more than one of the factories blowing up tbh)
This year.I missed the GME X TSLA tweets, confirmed this morning after reviewing Elon's timeline.Pretty sure GameStop is going to be the gaming provider for Tesla charging stations.
If you panic sold Tesla today better to just stick to boomer stocks. You can‚Äôt handle the volatility
The high P/S is more indicative of the fact that other market participants are seeing the same growth possibilities as you are. Many of the high-flyers are priced so that if they do not live up to their growth potential, their share price will get clobbered (see Elon's letter to Tesla employees a few months ago). I personally would rather find growth stories that the rest of the market is not already pricing in - Peter Lynch referred to this as GARP - "Growth At a Reasonable Price". With companies like SQ and Shopify (and high-flying tech / cloud), yes they have huge growth potential but their valuation is telling you that the market is recognizing that already, so unless you know something the rest of the market does not I would say that the risk / reward ratio is off. But again, that is just how I look for investments, to each their own.
Good Lord, I think she has a problem. Anyways I bought tesla calls too
Cathie if I wanted to own Tesla I would just buy Tesla
Cathie has said she has just bought more Tesla stock.. she really is a wsb member lol
TESLA 800 EOW, NOT A MEME!
LMAO CATHIE BOUGHT A SHIT LOSD OF TESLA TODAY. WE FUCKING MOON TOMORROW!!!!
I‚Äôll sell my house and buy tesla if it hits $100
Took my Tesla gains for the day and put it into WKHS because I‚Äôm a fucking idiot lmaoü§°
Lost over ten thousand this morning on that blank check company whose name has something in common with Winston Churchill. So of course I ran crying to Daddy Elon and bought some Tesla weeklies. Boom. Pretty much instantly made my money back and then some. Daddy is always there for me, even when I cheat on him and invest in other companies. He patiently waits for his prodigal son to return to the fold and then fattens him back up.
Bought more Tesla with todays flash sale.
1 : 1 ratio. There must be balance. So just remember for every tesla on the road...
Actually this makes me question Tesla's practices. Given the negative publicity regarding treatment of workers in Tesla factories.
Like that time when he couldn‚Äôt rescue those kids stuck in the cave with his submarine so he called the divers that rescued them pedophiles? Or the time he reopened his tesla factory early despite coronavirus lockdown restrictions in place? And then fired some employees who opted to stay working from home when they didn‚Äôt want to come in? Or how about his ex wife claiming their relationship was unhealthy and he regularly belittled her?
What government funding does Tesla rely on that would require that?I ask because:&gtA former Tesla employee, Crystal Guardado, was fired for testing positive for marijuana in 2017https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-updates/pages/elon-musk-marijuana-use-tesla-drug-policy.aspxp.s. before anyone thinks I'm anti-musk/tesla/whatever for asking the question, take a look at my username.
Got aapl at 120 and Tesla at 650. Let‚Äôs see how this plays out.Remindme! 30 days
Officially a Tesla bull again let‚Äôs go
Burry is like Elon if Tesla never happened
Anything you do on coke is like buying Tesla at $833, seemed like a good play at the time
Some context:&gt Tesla CEO Elon Musk quipped back at The Washington Post‚Äôs request for comment regarding an article about his future with the company, telling a reporter to give his ‚Äúregards to your puppet master.‚Äù&gt The Post‚Äôs piece wondered if Tesla can ‚Äúrun on Autopilot‚Äù and declared that ‚ÄúMusk moved to Texas and embraced celebrity.‚Äù The article elaborated on ‚Äúcritics‚Äù who have concerns that Musk‚Äôs schedule and public personality ‚Äúare beginning to show in the car company he runs.‚Äù&gt The company in question, Tesla, didn‚Äôt respond to The Post‚Äôs request for comment, the article notes. Musk, however, did ‚Äì with just one sentence presumably aimed at The Post‚Äôs owner, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.&gt ‚ÄúGive my regards to your puppet master,‚Äù Musk responded after a request for comment from the newspaper.&gt     ‚ÄúTesla did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In response to emails seeking comment, Musk replied only: ‚ÄúGive my regards to your puppet master.‚Äù&gt     ‚Äî Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) February 23, 2021&gt Bezos owns The Post, as noted in the article, and is mentioned as one of the examples of the potential for giant companies to stumble amid change.

Tesla is at P/S = 22. But it's fine because car manufacturers tend to have good profit margins, right? Right?
I told u all once I buy a put we will rally, check comment history I bought a $580 put on tesla as a sacrifice for you all go bulls go
$BB IVY webinars previous slide is jawbreaking. They are building the entire ecosystem for cars, with the Only App Store. Not just for QNX users. Not just for specific car companies. Anyone. They will own the system, but the car manufacturers will own the data.Revenue by toll (part of app purchase) or annual subscription fee....who cares.Huge barrier to entry.They are capitalizing on BB's first user advantage...175M cars.If an Apple or Tesla wanted to do this, they'd have to start a system with minimal cars and ask them to join a small system.This is the equivalent of when Apple had enough phones out there that they could then open up an App Store. They don‚Äôt get all the money for each app, but they get a take of anything sold on the ecosystem.By the way, Apple has $64B in sales on their App Store. (2020 value)This is just huge for $BB.
This is a sneaky üåà üêª post. Go fuck yourself OP, Tesla calls it is.
He bought options while Tesla was crashing.His "bet" has an expiration date.While his "bet" was sitting it can lose/value just like any other bet (options gain "extrinsic" value which is kind of the value the market places on that bet outside of the actual value of the stock, which is "intrinsic" value) and you can sell your bet (option), just like a share or stereo.Instead of waiting for the "bet" (option) to continue to see if it gets intrinsic value (i,e. the price of the stock goes above the strike on a call), he sold his bet based on its extrinsic value (whatever the market thinks his bet is worth).Since his bet gained value (due to rising IV  on calls) before it even hit ITM he sold it for a profit.SO someone paid him to "buy" his bet at a price lower then that person would have been able to make on their own (since IV was spiking)..and he profits without even knowing if his option will eventually print (that is the buyer's problem now).
Takes deep breath, looks at Tesla 5 year chart, smiles
Im only investing long-term and not in stocks only in etfs.I just came here and well I won't be investing in single stocks like apple or tesla, not my thing but I would at least like to understand how the market works
I bought in TESLA at 400$ sold at 850, do not buy it right now. The inverted fed bond yields are causing a large pullback on speculative stocks and Tesla is THE speculative stock so it's getting hit hard and should continue. On top of that when it does bottom out I expect it to trade sideways for awhile as the stock will leave a sour taste in peoples mouth and it won't be as popular as it is now. I literally said yesterday in my comment history it would continue to go down to 650 and it's now at 690 from 780 yesterday so I've been pretty accurate with Tesla. It's all in my comment history but I plan on waiting for Tesla to correct more and then I'll buy in and long hold again because it is a amazing company just too popular at the moment and overbought
**January 27th**: I was on the cusp of the upper class, gearing up to buy a Tesla, moving out of my studio apartment and buying a mansion, ordering a Kobe beef steak, adding a mistress.  **February 23rd**: Selling feet pics, warming up white toast with Skippy peanut butter for lunch, riding a stolen Lyft bike to work.
Definitely wasn‚Äôt just Tesla. lol
Bought some Tesla puts today so the market should be green again soon.
Yes i lost 10k. But it was the chance to make enough to not be somebodies bitch for the rest of my days. What have i learned?  Nothing, ill throw another 10k into tesla/pltr/spy calls until i don‚Äôt have to work another fucking hour!
He bought calls basically betting that Tesla will end at over $700 on 2/26, he did this while the stock was in freefall down to $620, so he got in cheap while people were scared of the falling price.Tesla bounced back up fairly quick, and his calls went way up in price, then he sold them.It was a big gamble that could have ended up in a big loss if the market/tesla didn't recover back up in time.
GameStop as the gaming provider for Tesla charging stations confirmed:https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354761802417057793?s=21
Can we just get rid of TESLA please?  I don‚Äôt like the market it‚Äôs created. Why is it allowed to moon 1000%+ and the market only moons a little. But then Tesla tanks 20% and the market tanks 20%?
TSLA at $100 will turn me back into a Tesla investor
I bought Tesla on Friday fml
short tesla long gme infinite dicks in my asshole
Switched from Tesla long to short at open. Paper handed and reversed my position at the peak. I'm actually just fucking stupid. Genuinely irretrievably stupid.
Canada Nickel Company. Had a good run in the last weeks but also dipped today. They are in talks with Tesla about supplying Nickel for their batteries. Not financial advise, am eating crayons üñç
I have been investing in stocks for 40 years. I have lost lots of money and made lots. I can tell you what I learned. DONT DAY TRADE. Buy stocks in solid companies that you buy there product. Because you and everyone else loves them. I.E. amzn, Tesla. They will go up and down 30% sometimes but in the long run they go up. Don‚Äôt invest all your money at once. Save some for a pull back at least 10% then buy more to average down. If your young you have plenty of years to make up losses and gain profit. You will never get rich putting money in the bank. You want to be the bank. Stop looking at stocks every day. It will drive you nuts
Go buy a Tesla lol
HFs are up to something against Elon/Tesla because he was fuelling the GME rocket. It's war!
Tesla is manufacturing its own batteries and have developed the 4680 tabless batteries, that will help lower risk of shortage and lower costs. They also will be releasing the $25k Model 2, that could be in production in China by 2022-2024.
lol wut? Tesla posts are few and far between nowadays
Imagine not buying the Tesla dip
My friend went 100% cash on Tesla weekly calls yesterday and 100% margin on Tesla shares. He got margin called this morning at the bottom. How do I stop him from killing himself?
Tim Apple, please announce your partnership with Tesla and Lucid for interdimensional EV spaceships. You've been working on it long enough. Now is the time.
That Tesla dip was a gift
Picked up Tesla at 633. Actually really glad this happened today. Lol
In the face of a -14% day, I bought a bunch of nintendo because I like pokemon. That's how you do it you paper hand bitches. You see blood everywhere and you buy nintendo. You buy tesla. You listen to jpow. You buy ford because you're built ford tough.
Puts on Tesla to buy more GME
Sold the bottom and bought puts on tesla... I'm an idiot
Sold the bottom and bought puts on tesla... I'm an idiot
70k in 3DTE OTM Tesla calls... didn't think I'd be unzipping this early
If you had been looking at the charts, they were all pretty much parabolic going up. Rises like that are unsustainable and when they fall, they crash hard. Tesla was the bellwether, imo, and it had been coming down since last week.
Elon Musk I know you're reading this. You can suck my dick. I haven't had a 5% down day since probably 2008. Your one tweet over the weekend was dead center on "fuck my portfolio". All will be forgiven if you send me a Tesla Model Y.
Very natural to have red days, tesla is having a tough few days and it‚Äôs the foundation of the bull market we‚Äôve been having. Less bullish stocks aren‚Äôt doing too bad but they‚Äôre going down a little too. We could see a recovery we could see a correction
The guy who accidentally bought those 6 dollar tesla puts might be on to something...
Daddy Elon. I have touched myself to my musk shrine every night, just as the Tesla manual instructs. Why are you doing this to me.
Bruce the wannabe Tesla owner / retired / stock broker whose wife is a Jennifer Anniston lookalike,  is streaming live on the GME discussion.   Great live commentary if you want to buy some mugs.  It's the GME Live Support Group.https://youtu.be/kUd2rXCUTlg
I've been on WSB for a long time. I bought into GME at $302, trying to recoup my FOMO from Tesla. When the stock peaked and tanked, I was bummed, but then decided that I trusted the thesis and started buying more shares. I have averaged down to $150 and hold 10 shares. If you're holding at $300+, please take this dip as an opportunity to average down if you can. The stock is insanely cheap and GME is still undervalued. **You increase the odds that you will make money if you get your average as low as you can afford to.** Yes, we were all retarded for buying at the peak. You can be less retarded right now by getting your average down to a less embarrassing price.
Yessss can't wait to buy Tesla at $200
What‚Äôs going on Tesla fell like 200pts in a week. Pltr got halved. Is this the end?
They have super toxic work culture , hate on immigration, declining and aging population and the whole ‚Äú kiss your bosses ass no matter what‚Äù, it like opposite of USA and risk taking What ppl fail to understand about Japan is even at the top  of bubble you would be ok if you allocated globally like any smart person does instead of having home country bias lead you and keep piling up into stocks at x100 CAPE, having 60/40 global allocation of equities part for Japanese person would work out pretty well It‚Äôs a very good example how anyone taking investments seriously doesn‚Äôt ignore the world and a lot of asset classes , part of reason why you should educate yourself and don‚Äôt spend too much time on Reddit is because it skews young and things that been working best get most attention Small caps russel 2000 beating sp500 over 5 years , emerging markets having a big shift to tech instead of energy , Japan index back around 30 000 first time in a while and all those assets look cheap relative to USA yet here you mostly will find Tesla/ ark etc talks
Are we holding everything. Im down fucking 10k on basic stocks like arkks tesla pltr amd apple: wtf
Tesla to $7
I‚Äôm buying a Tesla Model X with my GME tendies. Check back with me in 3 weeks and I‚Äôll prove it.
Shoulda cashed out my 5 Tesla at 900 ugh ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Me buying Tesla at 680: "This can't go any lower"Tesla: "Watch this"
I mean of course I sold 30k worth of tesla puts for a 20% loss last week, right?
I sold 150 shares of AMC yesterday to buy Tesla lmaooooooo
Remember when tesla below 800 was a buy
People were talkin bout Tesla 1000c on Friday
Call em.meme.stocks. pltr, and tesla have value to them. That is what matters to some retail. If you buy these stocks for quick gains. Then you are going to lose. Just hold
Whoever bought Tesla puts gets to retire this week
I got caught bagholding on clean energy when I‚Äôve been saying Tesla is scam for a year. The fake gains were too juicy but I got greedy. Fuck you tesla. Fuck you plug power.
Tesla new vix.
So tesla has gone up pretty much all year but of course as soon as I buy it tanks $200 per share. This was supposed to be my "safe bet" yet has caused more losses in 5 days than any autistic yolo i've found on here. f
If you‚Äôre panic selling Tesla and you wonder why you weren‚Äôt one of the ones getting in at $50 a year ago. This. This is why.
This isn‚Äôt suppose to happen. I am well diversified into Tesla, PLTR, ark etfs, and weed stocks.
Tesla taking down everyone with it... Don't do this man.
Sold all my Tesla for GME and AMC. Big prayers coming from this side of town.
Taketh from TESLA Giveth to GME
I have 1000 Tesla calls expiring next month I‚Äôm so fucked
At this rate the guy who yolod into tesla 6p may yet go ITM
spy 600, apple cars driving the streets and tesla ev flying jets by now if trump got a 2nd term.... miss him.......
Sold Tesla at 869 few weeks ago Jesus fn Christ! May have been a üìÑ üôå move but at least I didn‚Äôt see thousands of dollars disappear
We just need Musk to tweet that he's going to invest in Tesla.
People bitching about tesla. *Checks yearly chart* ItS OnLy Up ThReE hUnDrEd PeRcEnT
I like tesla
I liked Tesla at 880 so yardy know I absolutely love it at 670. 1000 by eoy
On the CFD account Tesla share price is represented as 675.10
Tesla what the fuck bro
I won‚Äôt buy puts on Tesla, out of sheer loyalty
LMAO.This Tesla crash is huge.
If you aren‚Äôt buying Tesla at open you ain‚Äôt black and Elon ain‚Äôt your homie
Tesla is only about 500 away from a fair price
Thank you for your post. I enjoyed your intellect. Sold all my Tesla shares and bought over 3000 shares in PLTR. I‚Äôve been able to make 40k this month with just PLTR.
Fuck I knew tesla would rise back once I shorted it fuck u all
Tesla $100 is not a meme.
bye bye teslaü§° looks like cisco in 2000
I keep like 10-15% of my portfolio for "meme stocks" that are actually cheap (HCMC and any other stock that's kind of hyped and under 5$) cause you never know what ticker actually gets to the moon hehe. As for the other 85-90% of my portfolio... only tickers that I believe in (NIO, PLTR, Tesla, Google and so on)Slow and steady wins the race.
Noobs who just learned about selling options calling it free money are in shambles. Wheres that guy that sold naked $700 tesla puts L O L
Tesla puts would‚Äôve been printing üòû
Cathie still buying Tesla at this point is pure wsb move lol
I've been fucked by Tesla more times than by a girl
Lucid sure is a tesla competitor, competing to see who can crash harder
Is this the end of Tesla!? Bought heavy on a ‚Äúdip‚Äù a week ago. Down 6k so far
I bet if I short Tesla it rises back up
Nice Tesla is back to fundamentals at 1000 P/E ratio
This is a great point. When thinking EV, everyone thinks of Tesla and this idea that Tesla is at the forefront of all things EV tech. They definitely have some really good technology no doubt. But I‚Äôm sure other giants (car companies and others) are throwing tons of money at problems that Tesla hasn‚Äôt solved either. Tesla is just very vocal about their tech, making people think they‚Äôre #1 in everything.
Can‚Äôt wait to watch Tesla YouTube shills and scammers explain why this drop is a good thing for Tesla
Holy fuck how is it that the ones I picked this month are getting absolutely recked. TAN, AAPL, and Tesla. I'm actually down 30% on my entire portfolio. Fuck this is looking scary
Tesla 692$$$$ üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª
I highly doubt Tesla dumps their holdings like that, for many reasons. Companies don't day trade their cash reserves. Shit needs advanced authorisation, strategic plans, disclosure plans/documentation/reports.
They aren't. Tesla price is absolutely nuts. It's all based on hope (and what can happen 10-20 years away) - not hard immediate fundamentals.
Tesla to 300 by open?
It's confusing, sure. But if you are throwing $1000 into put options you should be able to figure out that 150 $600 puts 1 year out on tesla is gonna cost a hell of a lot more than that.

Tesla drops to 4$ on news Elon Musk is a simulation.  Op makes bank.
2 salty points:   1) Sector rotation is real.  When covid started, sectors rotated rapidly into tech, growth, innovation, and some consumer staples/defensive.  Now that Covid is a late stage game, "people" are rotating into oil/energy, into equities with a re-opening story (DIS, AMC), and into bonds.  But really, as this new sector rotation continues, we truly don't know how the dust will settle.  Are "people" truly leaving behind giant wins such as MSFT, V, AMZN, AAPL, and shifting to Oil, Bonds, and Companies that need people to physically breathe on each other to buy crap(DIS, AMC)?  Maybe, maybe not.  Also, are the people rotating into Oil, Bonds, Finance, and the re-openers actual humans, or are those just shitty evil hedgies going into safe, value boomer plays?  I say, it's just a narrative that boomers can understand, big funds are rotating their sectors around as the economy re-opens, but there is always another growth story.   2) We are only looking at the start of another sector rotation, the last beginning was in 2016 with  new president and corporate tax cuts, the past 4 years felt like a chainsaw vasectomy.  Maybe your story about Tesla shifting to a mature stock, from a growth stock is true.  Or maybe that's what a boomer would want me to believe, and tesla actually has more growth stories to tell, as it creates new segments of the market to grow into (automated driving, robots that build cars, batteries that can be sold to outdated electrical grids in texas).  So yeah, if a sell off happens in one of the ARK funds, maybe it will hurt TSLA and ARKK if daddy musk can't pivot the momentum of his growth into a new segment.  Or maybe, as the dust is settling from this sector rotation, things change direction again?  also yes.  If TSLA truly does unwind in value as it shifts from a growth story to a mature company and can't pivot to another sector to grow into, then yes the ARK funds could unwind like a basket of toxic mortgage backed securities, technically you're right there.  But if that's your only logical conclusion, then you completely ignored your sector rotation.    3) I need more emojis, bears, rainbows, puppies, and balloons.  I can't understand your post about macro trends with my mongoloid brain.  something something lost decade analogy.  eggplant eggplant short float rainbow bear hug, gay otters are cute too.    Also I'm long semiconductors that give me a semi, skynet, data center and cell tower REIT's, physical land, and overpriced specialty drugs for rich people.
As long as there narrative is "shitty fundamentals , every 1$ the price raises makes the stock more attractive to short.   Tesla shorts lost 40 billion in 2020.    I find it so hard to understand why people think that all the shorts covered, and no one shorted.  What happens in 8 weeks, when we buy up the rest of liquidity and the volume is 500 k or less.   5 million people, buying 1 share a week.  And it won't matter from how high this was shorted.    All Reddit has to do is calmly buy, methodically, week after week.  And THAT is how the squeeze gets triggered.   Don't even need a catalyst.  Just buy the rest of the float.
Amazon had almost no earning because it reinvested almost all the profit into R&ampD, which turned into AWS, which now runs the world. Tesla? Nowhere close to Amazon.
"Arkk is overvalued."Thank you Einstein. Arkk/Tesla are obviously bubbles but the problem with your logic is none of us know when they will crash. Tesla could print a catchy headline tomorrow and the stock hit $1400 next month that would crush your short and margin call you. I think anyone with half a brain knows they'll crash, but the question is when. And your "bear senses tingly" isn't exactly a great thesis, as Einhorn's tingly bear senses costed him a lot of money."yet the underlying companies are largely unchanged."This is categorically false. (hint: pton, roku, etc.)
It sends a pretty strong message that they would rather put their cash into speculative investments rather than research and development or expanding manufacturing capacity.Tesla is not a hedge fund and I'm pretty sure most serious investors would prefer if it didn't act like one.
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm depressedMy whole life I‚Äôve just wanted to be ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù and finally made it at 35$170k income a year, $1m+ house, Tesla.  But I‚Äôm so drowned in bills and hate my job. Lost all my friends, been raw dogging korean escorts and that still doesn‚Äôt helpTf do I do
Can that stupid fucking coin go up I have Tesla calls :/
Definitely very important to remember that ARK constantly emphasize that their time horizon is 5-10 years. We'll see if that's doable and if they can hold to that if their fund really tanks for a good 2-3 years. In the case of Tesla though, though I definitely see a very large downside risk for the next several years, 5-10 years out looks very, very bright. Still I'm definitely not buying Tesla at these levels, I think there are much better places to put your money for the next several years as it stagnates or goes down by 50% or more. But if you truly don't give a fuck about sitting on a huge loss for like 3 years, buying it now is not quite as insane as it looks, I'm sure once the next wave begins towards the middle of this decade the tailwinds behind them will be even stronger, and though other auto manufacturers may catch up, there will be so much demand for EVs by that point that even with more competition it won't be very difficult to sell all the stock you can make until 2030
Guess what idiot bought more tesla at 870 last month...
I‚Äôll be the first to admit I‚Äôm holding Tesla calls, and I hurt, hurt real bad cotton.
Papa musk if my GME hits $42069 IM BUYING A TESLA
‚ÄúSeems to be someone making a large put buy on $6 Tesla. They must know something!‚Äù
So here's my crazy conspiracy theory for the day. And before you ask, yes I'm high. What if Elon posted that bc was too high to intentionally make a dip in bc to cause a dip in Tesla. Last year shorts lost tens of billions of dollars betting against Tesla. This past month while they've bled down 20% Tesla has been kinda quite on the news front other then the bc buy. What if Elon planned the dip to get the shorts to rush back in while hes been saving up announcements to act as repetitive catalysts to push the price back up also forcing the shorts to cover acting as a kind of mini squeeze. I know they're close to finishing that big factory in Cali yet no bad ass drone fly overs or video tours. Many other potential updates I can think of as well. Is this the weed talking or am I on to something?
The PE ratio is nuts and this is coming from a Tesla investor
Cathy Wood said something on this subject in the last few months, except she was talking about what the history of the auto industry has shown.Basically a hundred or so years ago when cars were newer and started to become affordable a ton of new car companies popped up all over the place. There were dozens of them. We're seeing the same exact thing right now, a lot of new EV startups are forming and trying to break into the market. So what eventually ended up happening to all those car companies over the next few decades? Most of them didn't have much of any moat so they eventually went under, or got acquired by the bigger players. Eventually the Big 3 automakers (Ford, GM, and Chrysler) together controlled 90% of the US auto market. Cathy Wood basically said the same is likely going to happen with the EV revolution, with most likely Tesla and 2 others controlling most of the market.
His YT channel is hilarious, he bought apple days before buffet and blackrock sold 10b+ combined, opened a tesla short position and closed it 10 days ago before the 20% dip and went balls deep in pltr mid $30s before the 40% correction. Holy shit inverse everything about this retard
Don‚Äôt make Elon angry or your Tesla will drive itself back to dealership
I‚Äôm sure there will be winners, but Amazon was a winner amongst a field of failures after the dot com bubble burst.  To just jump on any EV stock when their competition has been producing cars for the better part of the past century?  They can‚Äôt all be winners, and I think companies like NVIDIA are the better plays on autonomous technologies.  Tesla‚Äôs really what people are hoping to get in on, only they want to be in before it hits ridiculous highs.  Nikola‚Äôs already demonstrated the ugly side of such a FOMO-driven chase, and while I personally like the cars that I‚Äôve seen from NIO, we still have to wait and see before we can declare it China‚Äôs Tesla.  For what it‚Äôs worth, Cramer already has.
I think he‚Äôs right. Look at the Tesla put option chain, also note how many ITM puts are expiring on Friday. Now, look at the call option chain and the ITM calls. See the imbalance? It‚Äôs yuuuuge.
Here's why I don't think evs will be as big as the internet, the Internet is a whole new economy while evs are just an evolution on the automobile, the self driveing case is strong however a fault I find with the leseing code argument is that car companies do not want to help their competitors at all, ever auto maker is making their own self driving software and if tesla or nio has no customers then this leasing code is kinda usless.
Fun fact every Tesla sold would need to include 16 gold bars with it to justify the market cap
The interesting thing about a short is that there is no opportunity cost. You get the money up front and can go do all of that other fun stuff right now. In fact, they can go deeper into their other schemes by maxing out short interest while the rate is so low. It only flips when interest goes up and/or share price goes up. They may be looking at this and thinking, fuck it we are going to carry 1.26% interest until the end of time. Something big needs to change for them to believe that the price will never come down again and they should give in. I'm counting on earnings being a significant catalyst. But even then, it might not force a sudden squeeze. We may be in for a Tesla squeeze over the next 3 years. So be it.
It IS $600p. He‚Äôs wrong about being in pennies. If not, I‚Äôd sell you some $6p all day long for 8.50+, where the max value is $6 if Tesla went bankrupt. Lol
I see, my losses paid for your Tesla :P.  Well, good job!!!

Elon selling his Tesla stock to get into GME?
&gt A grand total of 1,949 funds now hold Tesla stock, which is up 318 from the sequential third quarter. BlackRock upped its holdings in the company by almost 12.1 million shares, with (surprise!) Susquehanna adding 1.5 million shares. You could safely say that Jeff Yass' team sought out growth stocks in Q4.Your post is missing WHY Tesla was bought by all these funds.Tesla was added to the SP500 in Q4, so every SP500 index, or fund that tracked the index, had to add Tesla. This isn't because they believe it's bullish (they might) and more about being required to add it.
The year is 2031. I get on my GameStop airlines flight departing from new GameStop and landing on los GameStop, as I drive my Tesla home. As soon as I get home I hop into my pool and once I get out my son GameStop The Third asks me about my "Deep Fucking Value" tattoo on my lower back. I look him deep in the eyes and tell him "Where he goes, I go, if he holds the line, I'm standing there right next to him."
TSLA puts - I love Tesla, but its current valuation makes zero sense. It's P/E ratio is 1230, a tech company with solid income like Apple has a P/E ratio of 35. If we're relying on fundamentals (which the market has been mostly ignoring recently but its still important to consider) Tesla should have a market cap around $20 billion, and a share price around $21 that's obviously never going to happen. I think in the next few months we'll see Tesla come down to a more reasonable valuation and I think the stock price will settle in the $300 - $400 range. I have been thinking this for months and while Tesla absolutely is the future, the future isn't here yet and they need to build a stronger track record of profitability before they can rightly have a nearly $1T valuation. &amp#x200BPosition:  TSLA $400 5/21p
I'm just gonna say it. Tesla is overpriced.
whoever thought adding tesla to SP500 was a good idea is an idiot.

Why are American tech founders so alien like? Facebook, Reddit, Amazon, Robinhood, Tesla? What‚Äôs going on?
Why do they keep going back to protecting people from getting hurt this is a fucking casino people you can‚Äôt always win. Why don‚Äôt they ask the real questions about why didn‚Äôt they restrict the buying of all of the other stocks like Apple and Tesla too not just GameStop and the other meme stocks what a joke
Finally sold my GME for 40$ with a total loss of 14k, did I do it right you guys? Had 50k at one point and had a chance to sell above 100+ for weeks. DID I DO IT RIGHT, I SOLD MY TESLA AND APPLE POSITIONS TO BUY GME ü§°ü§°ü§°. In the end I gave my money to hedge funds.
Try not to be a d\*ck about it.They are holding, don't shame them.That 3K may be a higher ratio of their overall net worth than that Tesla is to yours.Their holding may help you get that Tesla back (enough of them combined anyway) .WSB can be childish but stomping on our own is not the way, esp\[ecially those that are trying to help your position.We got plenty of people working against us, no need to shame allies to enemies.
Why didn't Robinhood need capital requirement when Tesla went from $300 to $4000 in a few months

How is Tesla not the biggest fraud in America right now?
Well, to be honest, Bezos is what prompted the question in my mind. Amazon feels like a company that has a defined trajectory now to where it doesn‚Äôt need bezos. However, the full potential of Tesla is practically infinite. I mean a majority of people think that Tesla is a car company and that is the least of what they are. Not sure how that ship steers without Elon. That‚Äôs not permanent, but I think for now it doesn‚Äôt thrive with out Musk at the reins.
I mean, bezos did and amazon is fine. Tesla isn't there yet, but it could be someday
Could you imagine if Elon died? Tesla would absolutely tank the next day. That company is I bet 50% Elon (even before the run-up... i would say it is even more so now).
Right. A lot of people are paying for Elon, not Tesla
No shit Sherlock. When the speaker of the house can go deep on Tesla, and she controls stuff like EV tax breaks, it's obvious they are corrupt and only playing to run up their score. I think Mad Maxine needs multiple mirrors before she can see her IQ add up over 100.The people currently in charge bailed out Wallstreet last time, and they still get Americans to vote for them.

Used priuses are a dime a dozen now that those people wanting pure efficiency have moved onto Tesla 3/Y. The catalytic converter theft is mostly in places where the economy is not that great, but as you said it is easily remedied by an anti theft device.
I swing traded Tesla a ton, but if you don't think Tesla is overvalued at this price you're lost in the sauce. The valution makes no sense, and no it being a tech company doesn't justify this price.

Put it this way due to the nature of ships and construction taking years, companies such as CC and MSC order ships way into the future while selling off older ships to scrap yards.Then when they are finally able to pay off the remaining amount they take ownership of the Ship in a massive handing over ceremony, they don't own it until then.Having ships being built means nothing, I have a tesla being built right now but i don't own it.Ships cost Billions my ape

You must be new. Tesla is WSB‚Äôs baby
Instructions unclear...  smoked SNDL weed and bought a Tesla.
If every company was as highly valued as tesla youd have a point. But you know damn well Tesla is an absurd outlier to how over valued vs fundamentals a company can be. Sure things might be a bit bubbled up but fucking do better than acting like Tesla is the barometer for the entire market
You say that but for example:* Microsoft 1999 ($20bn revenue, $8bn net income, $615bn market cap)* Tesla 2021 ($32bn revenue, $700m net income, $783bn market cap)Would you argue that the EV/self-driving bubble is not as bad as the tech bubble?
the fuck are you talking about? you said only Tesla and vw sell electric cars outside of China. that just isn't true. no one said anything about prices or quality. but go ahead and come check on this again in a year, there will probably be even more EV offerings then
yeah just Tesla, and VW. well plus Nissan, Jaguar, BMW, Volvo, Ford, Chevy, and Hyundai at this point there's only a few major companies left that don't make an EV.edit and this is just cars sold in the US, im sure there's plenty of others.
This is some retarded DD. I live in Norway and can tell you that there‚Äôs plenty of other EVs here including the ID3, Etron, Jaguar, etc. ID3 is literally all over Oslo. Tesla isn‚Äôt even the top selling EV brand these days
Guys is Tesla going back to $870? ............Guys?
Helll no dude. Stop losses on tesla is a bad move. If I had done that I would have prob barely doubled my money before getting stopped out at best instead of current 1300-1400% gains. Teslas just beginning, not selling any until 2030 at earliest. Good luck tho. üíé üôå

Elong announced a rocket powered hover Tesla, saying that he wanted it to hover higher but it's really easy to kill people. After the interview they went out and Elong showed Joe the prototype. It spun out of control and hit Joe killing him on impact. The video was on twitter but they memory holed it
Buying tesla now. Wish me luck guys
I know this is BS and you aren‚Äôt really asking but I‚Äôll answer anyway. Considering they only covered a fraction ( roughly 20-30% based on data ) it should jump to a min. of double $800+. Now they can also slowly drag this out like Tesla as they have no specific timeline to cover, but that would put them in a bad spot as there will likely be a catalyst that would propel us into hyperspace.
Hey hedgies, tomorrow would be a good day to end this before a catalyst makes everyone hop in and forces the issue again. Why wait for another hedge fund to come kill shot you for 5k / share when we will let you off for around 1k?  Then you can regroup, lick the peanut butter off Kramer‚Äôs balls and attempt to illegally drive down another stock in hopes of bankrupting it and leaving 15k people unemployed mid pandemic. Apes have shifted, we are longer than your wives BF dong and we can wait it out slowly like Tesla or put you out of your misery quickly  either way retards gone retard longer than you can remain solvent. üöîüöÅüöò(DFV holding) üíé‚úãüèºüöÄü¶ç(monke holding).
thank god we can pump tesla properly . back to basics gents. no rookies
Its funny because a lot of people did exactly that when Tesla became a meme stock.  People bet against it and lost a ton of money.  But WSB was like "daddy Elon" and "more calls!" and they kept winning.  Personally I pick a random stock that sounds decent, then google that stock name + reddit and read what people say about it.  If they say "this stock is going to moon soon" I avoid it.  But if people are like "Id stay away from this one", I usually buy 100 shares and end up making a decent profit. I've also tried the monkey strat and just threw money at random stocks.  About 80% of them made me some good money.  I bought Genius Brands at random one time, just purchased 100 stocks before anyone was talking about it at about 30 cents a share, and then sold when it hit $12.  By the time I sold, everyone on reddit was talking about how it was going to keep going up and up, but look at it now. So its a solid strategy to just do the opposite of whatever reddit says, most of the time.
Ya. Pretty dumb point.  That's like giving Tesla shit for partnering with Panasonic.
HOLDING the usual,  my diamond hands are shacky but how worse could it get?All my stuff is red, even my Tesla...Bought Some Sndl calls for next week...Any move I make fails so at this point I am letting my beta fish pick what stocks I buy lol
OF COURSE! do you not realize this industry hasnt even started yet? its like getting in tesla on day 1
SoWhen hits eventually hits 50 plus what lambo u picking out??I got 1800 shares I might just buy a Tesla for now
This post received more attention than I intended. I can elaborate here, but I apologize to anyone I cannot get to.Nearly every S&ampp 500 etf - and etfs generally - are weighted by market cap. This means the largest companies get the biggest slice of every dollar put into the etf.This process will add more to the biggest companies, which makes them bigger, and in turn gives them an even larger slice of the pie.Now think about every boomer putting their life savings into the s&ampp 500 for decades. This process is so entrenched that it does not matter what the large companies do, there is a huge capital infusion that regularly takes place. Since we know boomer money is going to the largest companies, we might as well front run this trade and buy the largest 100 companies that receive 80% of the etf capital. And if we were smarter we would just pour our money into the faangt stocks and beat the market even more. Since all the gains are now momentum, it actually doesn‚Äôt really matter what any company does. What matters is if you can get ahead of a trend that will get picked up into an etf.Take Tesla for example. They have never made money selling cars. They make money bc of gov tax credits. However, retail made them so large that they took over tech ETFs and got a steady infusion into their stock price. Elon then leveraged this high price with shelf offerings that brought billions into the balance sheet. So it didn‚Äôt matter that Tesla didn‚Äôt get big selling cars, once they are big it is a perpetual motion machine. TLDR: don‚Äôt look at a balance sheet, just buy the biggest company and front run the market.
HYLN be the first stock WSB pumps in awhile that has real real value wow. I bought HYLN. Tesla buys HYLN
This shit sucks now. I‚Äôm holding forever at this point but let‚Äôs be real about what happened: the big players here who had lots of shares sold (which was smart) and the rest of us held peanuts hoping they would turn into pearls. Hedgies/DTCC/generally all of Wall Street conspired to bail themselves out when they saw they were getting fucked and it worked because they can get away with playing dirty. The SEC exists to protect rich people. Often it‚Äôs protection from other rich people but at the end of the day it‚Äôs not you or me. Even if all they did was kick the can down the road, they kicked it far enough that they‚Äôll never see consequences. We made a good effort.Additionally, I just want to say Marc Cuban did right by this place when every other richboi bailed. Elon, Chamath, the guy who‚Äôs name I can‚Äôt remember, they wanted to get in on the fad and they did, got their exposure, and left. We fooled ourselves, those guys have NO interest in actually fucking up Wall Street. Where do you think their money lives? Mavs are my new favorite basketball team and I won‚Äôt buy a Tesla (not that I could afford to anyway).
Yeah only reason my mom lost money on tesla is because she didn't listen to my advice to buy it. I should have but it was more uncertain back then and I had about 10k less in savings
At some point Tesla is just gonna double out of the blue again. Saw this shit too many times already.
I made out like a bandit buying and holding Tesla while Mark Spiegel of Stanphyl Capital kept slinging mud at Tesla. I haven't been seeing him around as much lately, so I don't know if he's still got his touch.
Been investing for years. Last year made all the grief I've gotten about how Tesla is going to fail and I'm just throwing money away worth it.
Can you read? He said calls. Plus Tesla tanked leading up to March so he probably was holding calls during that
That's true for some very highly sought after cars like a Tesla or a jeep. But for a generic sedan it's different. Like in my area, I just looked up a new 2021 Jetta sells for around 20 grand, but a 2020 model with less than 10,000 miles is only 14 grand. It makes total financial sense to get the 1 year old model in that case.
A long term short squeeze is possible. Happened to Tesla, Lemonade, and Overstock.
I am thankful for this sub. Learning a lot about trading and how to laugh at the lack of volume behind the price drops. Tbh, I sold my Tesla last March and missed out bad. Now I know, the way of the ü¶ç is the only way.
You retards see two weeks of massive gains and then it dips back 2 days worth and all of sudden the world has ended.Stocks go up and down, not just up, you stupid bastards.  The weed stocks will go up again... and they‚Äôll go down a bit... then they‚Äôll go up again... it‚Äôs how the stock market works.  Not every stock is TESLA you dipshits.
How did you lose money on Tesla last year?
The sole problem is that this sub has become MAINSTREAM. That means all the retards, and not the smart retards, come flooding into this sub after being brainwashed by mainstream media. I miss when we were posting gain and loss Tesla swings. more gain than loss.
Tesla was always going to be the future of cars though. Electric is too important for the environment
Just remember, we're in the long run. Took Tesla 1 year to raise 1000%I'm not comparing, but understand the game mechanics.Holding strongNot advice
I made a huge profit off of my Tesla faggy ds this morning. Literally sold at the top somehow and timed it perfectly. So what did I do afterwards? I bought some GME shares of course. I swing options, and whenever I make a good profit I do this. It's like a gratuity given to the WSB community. Like tipping the waiter for excellent service. I did it for the boyz.
other than the 20% weed collapse, and a tesla regain... kinda quite out there ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
People gotta understand that a dumb strategy is still a strategy.I mean sure, I'm jealous that people are getting rich on stocks like GME and Tesla, but that doesn't mean that those people are inherently "wrong."They're exploiting the system to make money which is literally everyone's goal.Also, screw the author of the article for literally only mentioning one stock that is doing well and then somehow lumping Bitcoin and Doge into the mix with no context.

Just bought 250 shares of BB. The autonomous vehicle wave is coming right next to the EV wave. Every car company that isn‚Äôt a software intensive company (I.e Tesla and Apple) likely will not develop an RTOS in house and BlackBerry‚Äôs QNX is the industry standard right now. Holding onto this one for the long run
My theory is that bitcoin whales or bitcoin pump&ampdump discord groups might be behind this. They will dump bitcoin and that will have an impact on Tesla's stock price. Even if Tesla will drop by 5-10%, they will make few millions

My thing with that is, where does it end? It can't just keep trading multiple times above its realistic valuation, otherwise it will be this controversial stock forever. At some point it either has to have a correction or plateau until the company catches up with the price. Personally I think it will keep trading like this until the next big crash, whether that be next week or the next decade. So many people have made so much on it that it will be an obvious one to drop when things get sketchy.All that being said, I'm a shareholder and a huge fan of the company. Tesla will likely be responsible for a considerable portion of my retirement savings. I just get stressed now and then simply knowing that one day my account will get fucking demolished and I'm gonna have to swallow that big ass pill. I literally hope for a correction soon, just so I (and many, many others) can feel better about holding it.
If Tesla goes to under 20 bucks in the next month the entire economy of the us won‚Äôt exist in a month. That‚Äôs literally the only scenario I can see where Tesla takes that big a dive in a month. We‚Äôre talking 1929 on steroids
Excellent write up! My take on it complements yours.Cohen [sold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)) chewy for $3.3 billion, when it had $2 billion revenue. This was before infinite money brrr valuations, in 2017. GameStop has an EV of about $4.4 billion (not counting receivables, inventory, and factoring debt) with pre-COVID revenue of $8 billion. This is before they became a worldwide symbol of sticking it to the man.Assuming Cohen can only accomplish at GameStop what he accomplished at chewy and has no new tricks, he can easily get us to a $14-20 billion market cap with $8-10 billion in future revenue. That yeilds a post-turnaround share price of at least $200.If we go further than this and assume Cohen can permanently increase GameStop's gross margins (digital sales of exclusive content) the sky is the limit. GameStop [already sells](https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-exclusive-gamestop-value-worth/) exclusive games, so this is not a huge stretch.Amazon Google, Steam, Facebook, and Apple are also trying to become digital game distribution hubs with far greater volume than the console makers/studios. These companies have much larger platforms with several times the loyal users and they gave hoards of cash. They can simply add the same game titles and undercut prices to monopolize the market. GameStop suffered competitively and still does. Cohen is here to change that. With console makers and game studios facing the reality of being out-hubbed by much larger hubs, they will listen to proposals by an independent retailer like GameStop to diversify their distribution channels in a way that gives GameStop an edge (exclusive content, etc.).The fact that GameStop is competitively outmatched right now doesn't determine it's value 5 years from now. Cohen beat Amazon in the pet business and I trust he can do it with GameStop. With all this in our smooth brains and given our shareholder loyalty, think of how long this squeeze will last. This is probably the next Tesla.
Vanguard is a large shareholder in literally everything. Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, atat, GameStop, Coke. Tech stocks, value stocks, shit stocks, meme stocks. You can‚Äôt use them as evidence of anything.

Heya champ, not sure why you‚Äôre getting downvoted. Basically, some autist was able to guess his wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs banking password and cleared it out to place a bet that Tesla would hit $20.
The price of Tesla stock has to drop to $20 for these contracts(100 shares each) to be in the money.  It seems like somebody just flushed 1 mil down the drain.

Money represents work.  Money represents time.  I care because I‚Äôve stopped contributing work to society I retired at 35. But I still have an ethical obligation to help my fellow humans, and as it turns out fulfilling that obligation also helps me.  This is how I contribute.  That‚Äôs why I care.If you feel the point of this sub is to pump and dump, well then have at it. But since it‚Äôs been flooded with millions of people new to trading in the last month, I feel the point of this sub is not just ‚Äúmake your WSB and yolo‚Äù. It includes telling people how to put their profit in the bank how to sell high, and then buy the next one low.  Am I CNBC? Lmfao those fools would never have my portfolio of straight individual stocks, they‚Äôd have had me buying no fee ETFs instead of Tesla. Screw them.
ARK has been buying $PCAR for 3 weeks now in both ARKK and ARKQ, and I haven't seen anyone really talk about it yet. No youtubers hyping up this one yet. They're one of the largest truck manufacturers in the world and now have electric trucks set for delivery this year. They also just partnered with Aurora (led by ex-Tesla Lead) to develop autonomous trucks. Best part is this company is cheap.. only 34b market cap while they made 18b revenue this year with $1b profit during covid, and $25b revenue and $2b profit in 2019. I've bought calls for March $100 and $110
Tesla merger with SNDL? Big if true
Do ppl still Tesla?
Stay strong APES, if we were wrong there wouldn't be bots commenting on every positive post.  Would you go into a thread and shit all over someone who is holding a weed stock, or Tesla? No!  Think about it.  They NEED you to sell or there whole existence is fucked.

I'm in BB for long term. It seems to me they have alot of value to offer with their cyber security software asking with QNX. And on their website it says they are partnered with Ford &amp Toyota. I assume everything Tesla does now, we'll see (and maybe already are) with Ford and Toyota.
Elon is sweating rn watching Tesla stock
You mean the one that pumped weedstocks and tesla?
I might be stubborn and stuck in 2020 but I‚Äôm still bullish af on Tesla. It‚Äôs built different, I am loaded up on calls.
It's actually pretty nice to have so many newcomers. I honestly don't get it why people get mad?Like for example, when GME hit the top, this was everything that was mentioned here.Now there is a lot of mentions on weed, this is the perfect indicator guys, the top is near!Btw, made some hella gains on TLRY and APHA and now imma head out to AMD and CRSREdit: And ofc that juicy tesla dip.
Amazon I get.But somebody needs to explain Tesla and apple to me. You are not wrong in holding. They do go up and up... But apple hasn't been innovative for 10 years and offers less than Samsung in the consumer electronics while being twice as expensive and losses market share every year because of it. And Tesla has never turned a profit. What company fails to become profitable for a decade and doesn't go bancrupt?I swear, the entire financial sector is a cocain fueld pipe dream made of unicorns and glitter.
I think some people get it.  And I do love that they push the stocks they love that‚Äôs what ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù have done for decades.  But hey they can see all the GME bag holders in the sub.  It‚Äôs shocking they don‚Äôt think it can be them IF they don‚Äôt pay attention.   Saying you‚Äôll hold something forever is one of the first signs rational thought has left the station you don‚Äôt do that.  You always sell high, so you can buy the next one low.  If you don‚Äôt ever sell, you don‚Äôt ever really make the money. There are only three stocks I‚Äôve never sold after purchase, in my life.  One is Apple.  Two is Amazon.  Three is Tesla.   And the only reason I don‚Äôt sell them, is because I feel they can go higher.
Down 7k on Tesla calls, up 6k on Weed calls.
Elon if you tweet SNDL I‚Äôll buy a Tesla instead of a g wagon
I‚Äôve been trading since 2015. I‚Äôve seen Amazon &lt500$, Netflix &lt100$, Tesla at &lt180$. I will hold my gme shares for sure! When I have learned on thing it is that patience pays off. Just relax and let it grow, don‚Äôt worry about short term up and downs. I once was in amd and that was a crazy ride. If I would have just held it it would have paid off big time. Lesson learned. Just hold, be calm, emotions will go high and low, let them pass by like clouds in the sky. That‚Äôs the way you‚Äôll make big tendies in this game. Did you see how everyone got excited today at the rocket fuel phase? Guess what our goal is way higher than that and it will naturally climb up higher again. We don‚Äôt need hype. This thing will be driven by the share buy backs alone. It will be beautiful
Feeling pretty stupid for buying 2/12 $2.5 SNDL puts. Still own shares, but still. It seems every move I make is the opposite of what I should have done and it‚Äôs hurting my confidence. I clearly don‚Äôt have a clue what I‚Äôm doing. Luckily I have a pretty good cushion from Tesla/Apple.
 **Can someone explain why Tesla is FUCKING TANKING???**
I'm looking at my choices on Tesla a year ago and I feel *personally attacked* by this post.
Toyota as a behemoth that doesn't need explaining with numbers and it's valued at $253b, Tesla is 3x of Toyota. Are you saying it's definitive that Tesla is really worth 3x of Toyota? Investors are optimistic about Tesla's future valuation whether it's true or not for the present time. I hold GME and I don't think GME will be valued at $697b, I might be wrong but that's just my opinion. $69b? With this crazy market and huge potential for GME's future, who's to say that might not be even slightly possible? I didn't think Tesla would reach $600b, now it's at $800b. At the same time, the present time people are talking about $1000 because of the squeeze potential, not actual valuation. The sentiment around has always been GME dropping to reasonable levels after the squeeze.
Somebody bought 250k put contracts for tesla at a 20 dollar strike today. Something is indeed off. These are dated march 19 btw.
Yeah for example if your kids teacher is somehow long Tesla then short your kids future cuz that teacher don‚Äôt give a fuckkkk

ETFs are just collections of stocks weighted by a metric. There‚Äôs nothing magical about them. If your stock picks are underperforming your ETFs, it‚Äôs likely that your weighting mechanisms aren‚Äôt effective or that you‚Äôve picked companies which carry a lower geometric mean vs the ETFs that you‚Äôre investing in.Without specific information (eg. I picked Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix and Google at 25% each, but have consistently lost in terms of CAGR vs (insert ETF)), no one will be able to offer any kind of logical conclusion as to why you‚Äôre underperforming. If you‚Äôre invested in a high volatility ETF (eg ARK*), and you‚Äôre comparing it to your performance, you need to once again look at your holdings and their monthly individual geometric mean. As an overly simple example, a 50/50 split between Tesla and Shopify has a running CAGR of about 100% per year for the past 5 years this would have outperformed almost any ETF that you can pick including certain leveraged ones like TQQQ. This comes with trade offs (reasons not to do this), but it is an example of ‚Äúpicking stocks‚Äù.Bottom line it‚Äôs not that picking stocks is inherently less favorable vs an ETF, but picking stocks depends on what your targets are (volatility, drawdown expectations, Sharpe/Sortino ratios that you‚Äôre targeting, etc.)

Real estate bubble is back, and tech bubble is even larger. If you're in Tesla, apple, etc., look for a good exit strategy in the next 1-2 years. For everyone else who's been looking for an opportunity to get in, you'll be able to get in super low once everything collapses.  So many economists are creaming themselves over record highs, but all that means is that a huge bust is coming, so now's not the time to risk money you can't afford to lose.

Great job man. You should have tried paper trading at the start. But remember to not get emotional when buying or selling. If stocks hurt you emotionally then you need to be very careful. You need to grow that thick skin. At 16 I put 10k into tesla at 41$ a share(presplit) but sold at 48$. I messed up 200k. Tbh I should have cared more then I did but I saw my sister crying.

If Tesla isn‚Äôt above 900 tomorrow I‚Äôm gonna test drive a model s and shit in the glovebox
Ah people finally back on the Tesla üöÄ
Tesla spent more on beetcone than it spent on R&ampD in 2020
I‚Äôm quite literally all in on Tesla calls. It been trading side ways for a month. Time to moon 50-100%. Also bought 1k of the joke doggy coinage when it was at .43. So basically I‚Äôm hoping papa Elon will make me rich.
saw this on twitter, don't know how accurate it is:\&gt Tesla made more on \[digital currency\] since this morning than it did in all of Q4 selling cars.not only is it a car company, a "soon" to be robotaxi company, insurance company, battery company, services company, and energy storage company... but is now also a speculative investment fund?   ü§î
Dear Diary, it‚Äôs me Bear.I know I haven‚Äôt written in a while but they only let me have 15 minutes at the public library to use the internet.Half that time is used to check my Robinhood. The balance reads -$90,000 for some reason but I‚Äôm long SQQQ since March of 2020 so I‚Äôm basically break even. Hopefully it turns green soon.I tried to jack a car stereo to average down on my puts but it was a Tesla and it called the cops on me.They read -99% yesterday but today it briefly touched -98% for 38 minutes I took a screenshot I‚Äôll post that later.I already told you about how I lost my house playing SDow so I won‚Äôt go into detail. My Dow 10,000 hoodies and socks never sold but it keeps me warm now. I lost 3 toes to frostbite but I sleep comfortably knowing that my fundamentals are solid and that PE ratio still means something.Anyways I have to go. Going to be late for my shift at Wendy‚Äôs. They never hired me since my iPhone 6S was disconnected from non payment at Boost Mobile. I do handy work out in the parking lot. Things can get a little sticky but whatever keeps my puts going.Your neighborhood bear.
Musk said Tesla shares were too expensive back at 152. I‚Äôm still upset about it.
I've used all my day trades the last week getting out of bad tesla fds lmaooooooo
Someone bought $66 million worth of tesla 1000c expiring march 19....
9k -&gt peak 400k - 23kOn the real I'm pretty sad to see what happened last week and the fact that I didn't sell at the top. It was a mix of greed and belief that we could see it in the thousands. I believe in GME and think great things are ahead but I was literally looking forward to sending my mom thousands since she's paycheck to paycheck and was even thinking about my dream of buying a Tesla within the next year I haven't sold at all but I really pray I'll have the opportunity to have that much money again for myself and familyDiamond hands for the foreseeable future
&gt[In early 2020, Tesla was the most-shorted stock on the U.S. exchanges, with more than 18% of its outstanding stock in short positions.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/telsa-shorts-down-8-billion-in-2020-including-2point5-billion-on-monday.html)**18%** Wow! That's *so high*!G M E üöÄ
Guess I'll just sit here and wait on my 4 shares of Tesla to *eventually* hit over 900. So I can then wait some more lol
So in conclusion to you're thesis regarding the Gamestop phenomenon. The data has the thesis of us possibly, if not certainly getting a recovery of our diamond hand postions. By maneuvering us past the Earth's orbits, past the Moon. Past our fucking solar system, and waiving hi! To Papa's Musk Tesla Roadster astronaut. Sooooooo, looks like I'm doubling down tomorrow after my wife's boyfriend gets paid. - I'm not a financial advisor, I'm the retard who diamond handed UPS options back in October.
Tesla made a cool 300 million from buying 1.5 billion in the digital asset
Someone out there is wishing Tesla bought 1.5 billion in GameStop instead üòÇ
At current price,GME has Price-Sales ratio of 0.6 ü§ØChewy has 6.5 and Tesla has 30. ü§Øü§ØGME can grow much much bigger than Chewy.GME is also enjoying fanatic supports like Tesla.The future is bright. üòéüòéI'm definitely holding and buying more! üíéüíéüôåüôåHolding 2,700 GME. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Gme has the potential to be the next Tesla if they start turning retired arcade driving games (think Daytona USA etc) into electric cars.
Tesla buying shares so Elon can do some market manipulation later this afternoon.
Tesla fucking me in the ass
For the new ppl to wsb Tesla got the same hate as GME wen it was new
Tesla and it‚Äôs obsession with 860 is really getting on our nerves now  Fucking do something biatch.
Did I make a wrong decision selling my 21‚Äô Tesla model 3 performance for more shares of gme ? If it goes up I think I can get the roadster.
Yo, I gotta buy my a girl a Tesla so let‚Äôs bring this up!
Still holding. 50 @ 50. If we all had that much we'd own the company, wouldn't we? I'd hold at $250 if I had to. These fucks tried to kill Tesla. I want their squeezed money. I want to fuck them right out of the market so the next Tesla or Palantir can fucking fly without their manipulative bullshit.
Breaking news: Tesla buys $1.5b GME stock and plans to accept GME stock in the future as payment
Nice of GM to spend all of this money advertising for Tesla
I'd personally cut tesla down to 10%, if this was a 2-3 year game plan. Nothing against it, just a big downside risk if things go tits up world wide.
I really don't know how these guys keep their jobs. I remember they were always downgrading Tesla Stock.
I‚Äôm currently planning for my bounce back...Not going to lie guys, I‚Äôm absolutely disgusted with myself. I‚Äôve been investing since I was 18. I‚Äôm 21 now, and 3 years is by no means enough time to consider myself to be as educated as many other members in this forum, but I did something I never thought I would do: I bit on the thing I would‚Äôve laughed at people for buying a few months ago.I started working in high school as soon as I could. Always put away half of my check on paydays, saved 75-80% of all birthday/holiday season gifts (in cash, my dad had me start doing this when I was pretty young), and worked on the side for random cash jobs when I could.I‚Äôm a university student now, and I did lose my job at the start of the covid-19 pandemic, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I entered 2021 on a bad note. I felt like a financially comfortable college student, and that was a luxury my friends didn‚Äôt have.I‚Äôm sure many of you have guessed what happened to me by the tone of this post, but I bit on GME. I went against every logical instinct in my body, sold off numerous shares in companies continuing to grow through all of this, and have watched money I spent hours/days/weeks/months/years building. I‚Äôve taken bad beats before, but never like this.A lot of the older members of this sub have probably already been down this road, but for the younger guys out there.... please learn from me.I know that Mark Cuban and Elon talked about it.I know that low volumes are being sold off.But I knew the stock was never going to bounce back. I knew the initial train was the only one departing, but I didn‚Äôt want to believe it. I missed out on every major Bitcoin dip because I was worried about this happening. I missed Tesla because I figured the consistent growth from my investments would outshine the hit-or-miss chance of Tesla taking off. I‚Äôve missed plenty of others, but I was very comfortable for a kid my age up until yesterday. I lost thousands.If you‚Äôre going to get lucky on a stock, make it just that... luck. Don‚Äôt become emotionally invested. Hell, becoming logically invested can be dangerous at times. The bottom line is that the market is the market. Things go up, things go down... if you‚Äôre knowledgeable, you‚Äôll hopefully stay up more often than not. A sure-fire way to make sure you can‚Äôt consistently build your investment portfolio is to invest in stuff receiving a majority of its hype from guys that decided to major in economics because they saw ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street‚Äù.I have a few grand left in my investing account that I‚Äôll use to trade with once I map out a plan. I have cash on hand, a good bit of money in Bitcoin, and a few investments in companies that still look good. Either way, this sucks and I‚Äôm extremely embarrassed. I‚Äôd be lying if I said this didn‚Äôt hurt my pride... I felt like I was really getting the hang of this stuff and I wasn‚Äôt. Now I‚Äôm going to start from virtually the beginning.I probably lucked out by having this happen to me young. I didn‚Äôt lose a lot of money depending on your perspective, I just lost a large % of my money. As a student, this sucks, but I‚Äôm seeing people taking losses that could easily be life changing (in a bad way).New people, young people whoever needs to see this... don‚Äôt be me.
GameStop maybe the new tesla, tesla is priced with future ideas and hype. GameStop after today‚Äôs announcement maybe the amazon for games with a solid board and the hype i don‚Äôt see why GameStop won‚Äôt moon maybe not as high as tesla but high enough anyways.
Told my wife how much money I made on Tesla yesterday. If she asks today I'll just tell her it's about sending a message or some shit.
https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2021/02/03/2169124/0/en/GameStop-Appoints-Chief-Technology-Officer.htmlRead this again if you are considering selling. The bears are all noise. I hear no bell. Nothing has changed about this company. They are only getting started. AMAZON TESLA APPLE OF GAMING HERE WE COMEüíéü§≤üåùüåùüåùüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄRCRCRCRCRC
I didn't hear no bell. If we can rally it's squeezings all over again. I'm reverse martingaling. Every time it dips I double my shares. Originally if it hit a thousand per I would have made like a couple grand profit. Now I'm looking at new car money. If it dips down I'll be looking at Tesla money. It dips down AGAIN I'll be looking at that lambo money!
Ryan Cohen on board, Amazon exec just joined board as CTO. Why would all these powerful people join a ‚Äúdying‚Äù company if they didn‚Äôt have huge prospects soon. Earnings are coming 3/25. I think they‚Äôll announce something huge around then. Maybe a partnership with Amazon or Tesla, acquisition of a smaller company, I have no idea. But when the announcement is made we‚Äôll never see below $200. Shorts have to cover by then.
Sold my Tesla shares to buy GME
Hope the market dumps down to 29,900. This bubble needs a healthy pop. These tech companies extremely overvalued. Peloton worth 400 a share? FUCK NO. Chipotle worth 1,400 a share? FUCK NO. Tesla worth 900 a share? FUCK NO. Are we in the biggest bubble since the 90's? FUCK YES.
I used to have paper hands would sell tesla everytime a 10 percent drop came. Now im holding gme thru 50 60 drops like its nun. Even if I lose it all, imagine in the future when we actually pick good stocks with nice fundamentals. RIDE THIS THRU THE END BOYSSSS
I‚Äôd like to share my first experience in the stock market:- bought $200 worth of Amazon and Tesla stock - waited 2 days- sold $205 worth of Amazon and Tesla stock
Wouldn't be surprised if GME becomes the new tesla. Supported by retail, overvalued af, but now part of the index so what are you gonna do about it
S3 never got Tesla short interest right, was always off by 10's of millions, they know as much as you.
I think it's pointless comparing VW or previous squeezes. This squeeze was crashing the markets, and the VW squeeze wasn't fueled by the internet either. I don't think there is a lot of relevant history.  If Tesla can be worth 1400x P/E and people telling me to get in before it takes off again, fucking GME can be $800.
Stop aiming for short squeeze, its now a long term hold now. if you buy shares under 100 it is an alrite price. Don't bet on a short squeeze, we are probably going on the tesla path at this point
ELON IF YOU WATCHING THIS I'LL BUY A TESLA IF YOU TWEET ABOUT GME GREATNESS AGAIN!!!!!
My two greatest joys in life: trading Tesla 0DTEs on Friday and day trading TQQQ calls
NIO often had the exact same chart as Tesla.
I hope he puts it on his Tesla he‚Äôs buying with his tendies
God.. r/stocks has always been shit, but now they're acting all and mighty like "don't let what happened to WSB happen to us" and "please keep this sub about serious discussion and intelligent DD". Meanwhile any of the DD I've read there simultaneously took itself way more seriously and was way more garbage than the DD here, and the "serious discussions" were just them talking about the same meme stocks as here but without the humor, and with somehow less knowledge.The "rate my portfolio" threads are my favourite.PlS rAtE mY poRTfOliO, I 17 yR olD bOy2 share tesla1 share pltr0.32 share GMESo far am up 50% on the year. I am so good at investing I can do this every year and retire at 30.And then there's a few r/investing boomers leaking through telling everyone to stop buying stocks and just DCA index funds.
What Vlad the impaler and co. did to squash the momentum was fucked but if you invested more than you can afford to lose looking to make a quick buck you deserve to get crushed. Hedge funds aren‚Äôt going to fold easily this is going to be a 3-6 battle at least if not longer. Research the bull thesis on GME and decide on your own whether this is worth your money don‚Äôt just follow retards on wsb blindly. u/DeepFuckingValue posts some good summary videos on YouTube as roaring kitty. Use Tesla as an example of a short battle where the bulls ultimately prevailed. The shorts aren‚Äôt necessarily going to just unwind all in one shot it can take a long time.
I no longer care about the short interest. I'm now holding this stock partially because I like it, and partially out of spite. If Tesla can have an $800b cap then GME can have a $25b one at least. Hold because we like the stock.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll put on my Tesla
:(((( i bought 2 tesla stocks tho (losing $$)
Just got 5 more shares! Diamond handed!! Holding as if this was fckn Tesla in 2019!!! You want to get rich and go to Pluto?! Then u need to hold for a year or longer like u/deepfuckingvalue!!! BUY MORE!! HOLD THE LINE!!! Not selling til this shit rockets past 1k!!! üíéüíéüíéüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
¬†I hope all you realize after the events that transpired this stock will never dip below $50 again. It was massively undervalued before and easily worth $50-60 BEFORE the hype. Now with the media attention, new execs and leadership, dont be suprised then this stock is $250 next year and growing year after year after that. This will be the tesla JR and honestly at this price its looking like a long term hold not even accounting for the the stock shortage / failures to deliver debacle. In at 10 for 130 and you bet my ass I'Dd be retarded to sell now. Hold and see where this short share bull theory goes (which had not been disproven- the fact that all of this manipulation was predicted would happen last week is true, but its hard for people to endure the reality of it when they see red ) or check the stocks a year from now when its increased tenfold. Either way, its going up, with or without you.
What if Elon Musk got in with real big money. The last srike... I'm sure I'd buy a tesla

It needed to go to $100k a share, becoming the most valuable company in the world and worth more than Amazon, Apple and Tesla combined - despite being a shaky store-based retailer. At that point, all of Wall Street would go bankrupt and every GME shareholder would become an automatic multimillionaire.That was honestly what I think most of the newbies were hoping for. Deluded is the understatement of the century here
DONT BELIEVE THESE BOTS THAT ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT GAMESTOP DOES NOT WORTH $100+ ACCORDING TO FUNDAMENTALSThese guys are usually the ones who makes a $1000 investment and does a 8% return in 10 years lmaoThese guys are fucking horrible.If we are watching only the fundamentals(according to their logic) then please tell Tesla to come down around $100. Nothing against Tesla, i love them and i love Elon, but they do not make any profit and every other car anufacturer literally makes more car than them.The reason why the price is around $900 is because the fact that stockholders believe in Tesla's huge potential. But that is not fundamentals, that is specualtion.Thats why, if the Gamestop stockholders believe in the future of GME, it can skyrocket to the goddamn outer rim with all this attention to the stock.So do not fucking sell just because some BOOMER dude telling you with his laughable 8% return in 10 years that you should sell because gme fundamentals sucks right now.And yes maybe the squeeze already happened, but the thing is, tesla skyrocketed without any short squeeze.

Others view it differently perhaps, but with a PE Ratio of &gt1500, I'd say Tesla is a meme stock too. It has a better outlook than GME for sure, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't a similar crowd (RobinHood users) who were driving the Tesla rally purely on their lack of understanding of the market, and heavy price corrections are coming. On the other hand any Tesla investor has been more successful than I for the last year, so what do I know :)

Was a bit pissed over last few days, but I couldn't give a fuck now. I'll hold that shit for the ride. If it ends up as a few shares in GME worth fuck all then that can stay in my portfolio as a reminder of this riot. If it hits the moon I'll buy a tesla, cases of champagne and hoon around in it till I crash and burn. Whatever is next though, we will be ready and hopefully not shafted over by the traders this time.

Dumping the majority into Tesla. Donating the rest.
you must be new, this whole affair started out as a turnaround story, not a short squeeze story. We won‚Äôt reach valuations around apple or tesla but we‚Äôre far from doomed.
Watching a yahoo interview right now, Cathie Wood on the Tesla dump in 2019 "We believed in the company and the play, the dip was a gift for us"
&gtGamestop is doomed as a company.There is a mountain of difference between Tesla/Apple and a doomed company. In fact the vast majority of companies fall in the between, which you seem to ignore as a possibility.You are certainly entitled to your opinion, but I can't help but feel like you're just trying so hard to take a stand against the mentality at WSB, that you have gone to the other deep end.

The year is 2025. You're driving home in your new tesla that you bought from selling your $GME.  It's dark out but your wife's boyfriend needed more lube.  You stop the car because there's something crawling out into the middle of the road. "It's them", you think to yourself. The dark figure starts running towards you. He tackles you. He's on top of you now you're trying to get away. He mumbles deeply into your ear "paper handed bitch". He starts punching you in the gut. "DIAMOND HANDS, DIAMOND HANDS", he says with each blow.  Suddenly he stops and looks up into the sky, he sees the moon. "It must be a sign". He runs off on all fours as he chants "The squeeze is coming, its a sign". You were lucky this time. Next time you might not be. You consider stopping at the TslaMart and picking up the new bag-holder-boulder3000 to defend yourself.  Its a rock in the shape of a Gabe Plotkin.
Watching WSB bets refer to GME as a [Tesla or an Apple kinda company](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbdi8m/message_from_a_tsla_veteran_shut_the_fuck_up_and/) has me thinking some of these people need to take a step back and slap themselves back the fuck to Earth. What started out as a way for some people to make money on the flip side of hedge funds shorting the stock has turned into a god damn religion. Gamestop is doomed as a company.
This is a wise comment. I was in at 15 and started trimming position at $250 up to $350, and sadly down to $100 yesterday. Had I been in possession of a crystal ball, I could have made out with $70k. Real gain closer to $30k, and I‚Äôm still holding 25 shares. That euphoria, IMO, is just as dangerous, if not more so, than the dread of a GUH day. You stop doing anything for your job, you‚Äôre glued to a screen dreaming of your riches and new life. And you never think of an exit. I happened to me with spy puts in March, happened to me with Tesla every which way, and I was fortunate enough to be just a little prudent with my gme play. Hedging is ok. Taking profits is ok. It‚Äôs what you need to survive and not get wiped out. There‚Äôs always another trade.
selling 10 tesla shares and all in on amc
Maybe he'll tweet Tesla is over valued? That always helps.Perhaps he'll release the new Tesla GS powered by Gamestop shorts...
I remember in Tesla this summer - right as I was about to give up and throw in the towel (for a while anyways), they announced the stock split that night and never looked backAt some point RC will want to use goodwill he‚Äôs developed to keep momentum going
Gonna sell my Tesla share and put the funds for Gamestop in the morning!
Wow GME is actually being compared to Tesla. This just keeps getting more *interesting*
#OG TESLA INVESTORS BE LIKE BUCKLE UP WEVE TREADED THESE WATERS BEFORE üòàüòàüòà INCLUDING ME!!! LETS SHOW EM HOW GME AND TSLA GANG REALLY BANG!!! NEVER FOLD APES MOMMA APE AINT RAISE NO PAPERHANDED BITCH!!!!!ü¶çüíéüìàüçåüëæ
Those of us who have bought in have to remember why we bought in: we believed that GME was worth more than the share price.  DFV had this conviction and so he bought and held.  Daddy Cohen brought the value play up even further.  He believed so heavily in the company that he bought 12.9% and brought 2 ex-Chewy members on the board.  RC has conviction that he can stage a turn around.  Most of us grew up gaming and remember that you couldn't find shit at anywhere other than Gamestop or EB Games.  Since EB Games got bought out by Gamestop, Gamestop became the only player.  We ALL know that gaming has seen a huge uptick in 2020 (COVID) and even before then.  How many of your friends' kids, your little nieces/nephews, your own kids are glued to a freaking screen?  Gamestop.com is now offering PC parts and there's been a lot of DD that Gamestop will start having build-a-pc kiosks which is amazing because you literally cannot do that at any other retail location. And don't forget their current online sales, they are already spectacular at 300% YoY!!  Yes, COVID drove online sales, but this isn't a dead company.  There's probably less risk buying GME at $50 than Apple at $2.   All the short's thesis of Gamestop being the next Blockbuster was built on hubris they've paid for that in the last few weeks.  They have again opened new short positions and those are now printing heavily, but how long will that last?  They probably still think that Gamestop is still the next Blockbuster, but it will just take a longer time to die due to the uptick of the new console release.  Short float as of yesterday 2/1/2021 was 226.42% according to this [source.](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today).  Cost to borrow was at 20-25% according to Ortex which is still insanely high. Regardless of winning position, they need to pay interest on their position.  Will that explode in their face again?  I believe it will when Gamestop has another big catalyst or there's the turn around story. Is the stock worth $80 right now?  I have no idea.  Is it worth $150?  No idea?  $30/share?  No idea.  Is Tesla worth almost $900?  No idea, but someone will pay almost $900/share for Tesla.  Here's something insightful that was posted right before all this GME madness took hold.  It's a great reminder on how and why we invest.[A Venture Capital Perspective on GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/?utm_source=reddit&amputm_medium=usertext&amputm_name=wallstreetbets&amputm_content=t3_lbc758)I'm still holding 800+ shares and sold 4x 2/5 45p.  If the price does hit $45 on Friday, I'll take these shares and hold.
Did this guy just compare Game Stop to both Apple and Tesla?
Tesla calls now, Tesla calls then, Tesla calls forever.
Everyone would have to order a Tesla if that happens
1000 @ 28. I almost bought a house, now I can barely afford the tesla that would have gone in the garage. I'll be holding for a year now, so I can dodge the short term gainz tax. Also, I like the stock.
I‚Äôm all for shitting on Tesla, but Tesla‚Äôs market cap being somewhat delusional doesn‚Äôt change the fact GME‚Äôs market cap has been tripping on 5 tabs of acid and is just coming off the bowl of Salvia it smoked.
And? Tesla did regular 20-40% gutter days back in 2019. This happens in volatile stock trading. It‚Äôs not abnormal
AHAHAHAHA.Tesla was the ONE meme that could withstand an implosion and come back. And that's because Tesla is a fucking world-changing company with limitless potential.OP is trippin right now
Stock market back on easy mode. Stimmy talks going well.Gamestonk tanking Tesla mooning. AOC sponsoring onlyfans. Life is good.
People were mocking Tesla the whole run up. I never sold. ‚úãü§öüíéüíéüíé
We need Ryan Cohen to announce GameStop is partnering with Tesla.
This is such a dumb post. Tesla is a real company with exciting prospects. Even then, no ‚Äúactual investor‚Äù has a portfolio all in on a single stock like TSLA. You‚Äôre an amateur that is riding a bubble and you think you‚Äôre a pro.
Tesla is an company with a story. GME is a company without one. Amc, BB, those could be greats again, could be made murky but GME is a long shot in the dark.
Lol I had 80% of my portfolio in GME and walked away with an 8-bagger, then slammed it into Tesla on Monday and rode the bull run the last 2 days. I‚Äôm a walking advertisement for how not to invest but it‚Äôs working out pretty good so far.
Lmfao GME is no Tesla. They aren‚Äôt changing the world. It‚Äôs a trash stock and the momentum from last week is gone and so are any hopes of the stock breaking out. Yall played yourselves
Out of all the retarded sh*t I‚Äôve read since yesterday, this one tops the list! You have to be a new of kind of retard to draw a parallel between Tesla and GameStop lol!
Comparing TSLA to GME is like comparing a Tesla to a  Yugo.
You‚Äôre right buying puts on Tesla is a good idea
Legit lol'd at "Tesla converted to diesel" that would be sick
Well that's just fucking great. I'm glad my 401k is "safe" but I also would like a tesla converted to diesel with gamestonk tendies
This is horrible advice. I was big on Tesla since their first car in the 2000s. Tesla blew up because of meme and fundamentals. GME is just meme. Only way GME can be like Tesla is they need fundamentals too.
I am one of those people wishing I had invested in Tesla back in October when I got my stimulus check in the mail but my bills were a little more important.
Tesla to 1000 this week but more likely next week
He can put the $500k in tesla and make it back
If there's one thing I've learned from this whole debacle is if someone is saying something you don't agree with and you think they're totally wrong. It's a really good idea to go outside your filter bubble, dig in and do some research, and try to figure it out if the people you think are wrong are saying is wrong things.I wish I had done that when I saw deep fucking values post the first time. I dismissed it because he wants to buy retail, and i didn't fully understand the bull case or squeeze trade. I thought LOL Tesla is overvalued why would someone buy that.I shorted Zoom because it's stupid overvaluedWall Street bets is a great forum of ideas but it's important to do your own research and figure out why those ideas are right or wrong.Especially if it fits your thinking.
Exactly. Can‚Äôt remember who said it I think it was Chamath, but, we are the guys who destroyed short sellers and took Tesla to the moon, and we will do the same with GME and AMC üöÄ
yeah yeah yeah what op said....now do we think tesla will hit 888 by friday or am I big fucked?
Tesla investors have been forged to Diamond hand. After investing in Tesla, no stock movement can phase me if I believe in something.I'm always borrowing money. I believe in me.
80% of the recent subs couldn't handle Tesla shares. Last year before Tesla split there was a point it was up to around 900 then dropped to about 200. This GME pull back is nothing for üíé ‚úã. Hold strong and buy the dip. Get excited about voting on the future of gamestop.
So GME is gonna be the next Tesla? üò≥üò≥
And that is why I HOLD! I am nervous now, have been activley seeking out contrary views in the sea of confirmation bias, but the numbers just don't make sense.Maybe hedge funds are just far more clever than me (they are) but the extent of the disinformation campaign, shutting retail out from buying. Like that was pretty extreme, and I don't see them doing all that if exiting their position was this easy. Fuck it, they are shares. I can just hold them for 5 years until Ryan Cohen is president of the new united states and there will be a gamestop at every tesla charging station on mars.
This is the way I remember that crazy spike tesla had pre pandemic i was a gay bear and lost over 2k in puts. Back then I would buy and sell anytime the stock went down 1 dollar. I learned my lesson I Will hold either to the point where I can buy a fucking lambo and fuck 3 hookers or until im standing out side of a game stop asking for tendies
I have bought and sold Tesla so many times and probably made 50 bucks total.  Fucking hold!!!
Tesla and GameStop are very different and I don‚Äôt see them as comparable as a good long term hold.
The problem is that Tesla for many are longterm investment. If people are in gme for long term and not just short squeeze then gme may survive. However if everyone here is just trying to achieve idiotic short squeeze then everyone is just fucked. That's only way it'll end. Shorts were correct all along with vw as well. It ended back to where it started.
For anyone who lost money on GME, time to go back to the old tried and true meme play. Tesla Calls $1000 02/05/21Literally cannot go tits up.
Nio &amp Tesla both make electric vehicles and produce battery technology, AMC is a movie theatre amongst other things within the filming industry and GameStop is a video game/computer retailer, how are they 2 comparable apart from high short % ?it is obviously fucking coordinated. You don't even have to be retarded to see this.
Again, like i answered another comment. I also feel that if you remove the meme factor it has now that 45 is a very reasonable target. But with the attention it has and the meme status its achieved similar to Tesla (not Tesla, i know, but similar) i feel like 75-95 is where its gonna swing between
I feel that is an appropriate assessment IF sentiment was taken out. I feel like with the attention it has now its almost taken on a Tesla like ethos. No i dont believe it‚Äôs Tesla but i do feel its gaining a cult following similar especially since it already has a very strong brand identity and cultural underpinnings. Video game are a huge cultural market that GME is already well established in. That being said i feel 75-95 with sentiment included is where it‚Äôll stay. I too am a retard so... idk
If you diversify your GME long with Tesla calls, and spy puts you are the the ultimate WSB hero.
Selling my last 2 Tesla Shares for Gamestop.
Where my tesla bois? We taking off tomorrow?
Yeah, that is true, but Tesla did have a massive run up this past year overall despite its high stock price. It wouldn't be hard to believe that Tesla's successful run-up lead people to think they've "missed the boat" with Tesla. Tesla's performance during 2020 and it being an EV automaker made Nio seem attractive at it's low price range which was accessible to people to invest in and people thought that because Tesla ran up massively, Nio will too and it did, thanks to Tesla. If Tesla didn't have that massive run up and made people reconsider EVs to actually be the future of automotives, Nio wouldn't have been as successful and would've likely been bankrupt had the CCP not have bailed them out. So Nio does ride Tesla's coattails as mentioned before
 so i really want to clear something because you guys are really just some different shit.i don't care what the $GME price now, and I don't care if the price even hits frickin bickini rock bottom.why?because stock prices most of the time do not reflect the fundamentals. if it would tesla would not have a price around $900I'm not saying that tesla is a bad company, I personally like it, and I like Elon too.but rn they should not trade at $900. they do because of the hype, because of the attention, and the fanboys.and that's why we have to be fanboys and stick to this stock. even If it hits rock bottom, i believe that it can bounce easily back, and reach all time highs easily. and the reason is literally the same as with tesla. everybody is speculating that tesla will be indeed a really big and strong company.with the CEO swap at gme, they are very likely to shift to e-commerce, and esports stuff. which is fricking huge, with all this attention behind the stock.TLDRHOLD BUT EVEN IF THE SHORT TIME PLAY WONT WORK, THE LONG TERM WILL DEFINITELY WILL.but I'm not a financial adviser tho.
tesla didn't 10x in august-november
Is tesla worth what it's trading at? No. They love when stocks are irrational when it benefits them, but hate when regular people take advantage of their mistakes. They over leveraged and we caught them with their pants down.
Wait, they have tesla ATV?
Tesla is a \*different\* kind of meme stock. Maybe a \*celebrity\* stock would be a better way to put it. The obvious difference being that Tesla does have a bright future, regardless of what the exact price of the stock should be.GME &amp AMC? Noooottt so much.
Ya. To be fair - $20 to $500 is pretty squeezyWhy we won‚Äôt squeeze:-Cost of borrow down (objectively from 30%s to teens on IBKR)-Melvin likely out, bailed by c-del who, whatever way, can manage position much better -deep ootm calls now exist (previously only up to $60) which makes hedging easier -peak media attention / euphoria / global interest peaked last week and has died off-volume has given shorts plenty of room to cover -ccac guy sold, Michael burry criticized price action, rod sold a bunch, so did Hubbard, Viking not really involved, dfv can do whatever the fck he wants at any time-Volkswagen was a completely different situationWhy we will squeeze -artificially suppressed buying comes roaring back -still one of the most shorted floats on Wall Street by most accounts-zero shares available for borrow on IBKR, Fidelity-zero notable insider selling (RC etc)-no offering from the company (they know stuff and hate shorts)-second squeeze, if there is one, likely won‚Äôt be halted by RH liquidity issues unless they want to destroy their biz forever -possibility for new strategic investments (blue sky like Microsoft, Sony, Tesla?, I don‚Äôt know) or friendly billionaires like Cuban to come in-retail has exhibited extremely strong hands and most are unlikely to sell between zero and $500 given what we went through last week ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Can i call shotgun in the Tesla?
True! BB is definitely a long term play it was steadily going up before this craziness started. Imagine a news coming out of a BB and Tesla partnership! Phew
GME folks, I held on Tesla when it fell to like $170 (pre split). It‚Äôs now $4360 (calculated in pre-split value). You can do this!
BOYS I BOUGHT 91 SHARE OF AMC AT $2.12! ABOUT 2 OR 3 WEEKS AGO! LOOK WHERE ITS AT NOW! HOLD THE FUCKING LINE! WE ARE GOING TO THE FUCKING MOON ON TESLA ROCKETSHIPS AFTER THIS DIP!
That feel when you shopping for a Tesla on Wednesday and filling out job applications on Tuesday.
Thanks for confirming my thoughts, everything has really gone to shit so much in 1 week. I‚Äôm genuinely upset that I have nowhere else to go to suggest going 100% in Tesla without being laughed at. Every investing sub outside of wsb is ETFs, savings account interest, diversification and whatever kinds of bullshit. There‚Äôs no way out of this mess except for closing all posts to verified/flaired members only, kind of like r/conservative but not for the purpose of protecting echo chambers. I can‚Äôt even speak out or I get downvoted by 6.5 million new members. And thanks for your early mod service.
Over the next eighteen months Tesla is going to get steamrolled by the existing big auto companies as they roll out their own EVs.   It is already happening in Europe.  It is losing market share hand over fist as the other auto companies push out their own EVs.  Once people figure out this out the stock will drop like a rock.  In the end Tesla will be one EV maker among many
I learned my lesson about being a gay bear when I bought puts on tesla. Gay bears never win thats why there are so many salty retards trying to see us fail
Dear Elon, if you could just buy a couple mill of stock to prop us up to get back at the shorty shorts we win and then we‚Äôll all buy a Tesla and buy Tesla stocks thanks for coming to my Ted Talk This is financial advice
Tesla millionaires did this one very thing: hold. Yes some bet big dick money on options. But most held and still holding. Hold. Kind of a new thing for wsb since it was more of an options forum. I remember lurking back in the day when it was mostly crazy spy options. Look at us now, lol buying shares aka commons and holding. We are boomers. Was not only 6 weeks ago I‚Äôd read comments like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a share?‚Äù....an option with no expiry. Wsb is compromised right now by hedgiees using our own psyche against us. Think you can create a gamma squeeze? Here‚Äôs some $800 calls, buy em up! Just hold. If you can‚Äôt hold then sell. But imagine selling - will you feel relief? Will you feel relief but keep checking GameStop? Will you feel relief when the price goes to $20? How will you feel if it goes to $828.49? Get out of your head. Make a decision. Breathe. Hold. üò≥üí©ü•úüöÄ. I like this stock because of Ryan Cohens potential and I‚Äôm stupid but I‚Äôm believe I‚Äôm buying early. When the company is turned around and solid, I will sell calls and theta gang all those who sat on the sidelines during these epic last few weeks. Hold or get on the sideline and go play options on Aphria or some renewable energy buydem dips. Be well...
I went from 24K to 140k then 20k due to the rona and tesla FDs, then from 12k to 37k from gamestop now back to 12k. I really believe in the squeeze, the math makes sense, i even bought a call today too. Dont tell anyone until you sell, have stop losses, and don‚Äôt double dip. Wait up...
How is it winning if a ton of people here lost tens of thousands of dollars? Especially if it‚Äôs normal people who don‚Äôt really understand the markets. These people bought at the top due to mania, and then sold at a loss. That‚Äôs not sticking it to anyone, except themselves. The corrupt financial system and Federal Reserve are still printing digital dollars like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. Yes the hedge fund went bankrupt - but as long as the Fed keeps up their bullshit and devaluing the US Dollar, the financial system is a house of cards.Bring down the house, and then you win. Get Jerome Powell and Steve Mnuchin fired. Also a huge win. The system is still very much rigged. Nancy Pelosi is buying options on Tesla and Apple, and she makes the policy for these companies! Politicians are ruining the economy for their own personally gain. Shed light on that corruption, the hedge funds aren‚Äôt as big of enemies as the politicians are when you really think about it.
Is pelosi tits deep in Tesla calls!??
It is in people‚Äôs best interest to tell everyone GME is a once in a lifetime opportunity, but people are forgetting all of the Tesla millionaires we minted last year. There will be another, and another, and another. Maybe not with the same infinity squeeze potential, but with massive upside that you can easily make your fortune on. Learn from this one and persist. And remember the true measure of a man is not how he behaves in moments of comfort and convenience but how he stands at times of controversy and challenges.
Welcome retards. I did the same few years back. In few years,  there will be new retards. This is just baptism.  I did the same with Tesla,  Beyond meat, Netflix... still recovering though..lol
Sold all of my Tesla to buy GME today
I miss when it was just Tesla gang going crazy üòÇüòÇ
Spicy take with another theory/analysis that will probably get me downvoted to hell.tldr: If you want to see it moon, stop buying and selling options on this stock. It happened with tesla, and it's happening now. You saw the volume on the stock today vs options. If everyone on reddit is telling the truth, then we ARE the long volume. Redditors took profit, redditors bought more on the dip but there weren't the sort of huge volume you would see for this amount of volatility.There is not some magical cabal controlling this stock, there are individual investors, some of them institutions but still individuals making choices about when to take profit and what strategy to take.And every one of these individuals is a vulture who is trying to extract maximum profit from their positions. Even you. Some of you fought the ladder attack, some of you joined it.This ebb and flow is what prevents this sort of event from being an everyday thing. There is ALWAYS someone on the other side trying to counter your strategy. Jumping on the bandwagon or hedging against you. You don't need to imagine some sort of cabal manipulating the price down. If they could do that by themselves the price would never have gone about $20. It's not just the hedges now, you are competing against some guy named Bob who made 1 mil on the run up then sold off and yoloed it into puts. And 500 guys just like him with a variety of positions.The real villains here are the algos that have been using the IV to skim huge amounts of money by closing the options gaps as soon as they open up. Ask yourself who is taking those $35 dollar premiums on an 80 dollar price difference, can you trade fast enough to exploit that with low risk? Fuck no... but someone is.For all we know, we are fighting with ourselves now and the hedges are just trading on that artificial IV, with tools we can never have. If enough people stop buying and selling options then the price will stabilize on demand, and we represent a huge amount of demand.
My dads financial advisor told me to sell Tesla before it gets added to the S&ampP 500, those guys know jack shit
Same thing happened when Tesla went from 500-150. GameStop may be a little further away than Tesla in terms of business potential but GME is in a better position for squeezing than Tesla was.
The point of the GME shares is to be see how far we can take it. Don't put in more than you can juuust about handle losing, and do some sensible shit on your other shares. Goog, Tesla or whatever. This is the chance to be a fearless ape. Solidarity hold. Defy the odds and squeeze again.
At a pe of over 1300 there‚Äôs a good chance tesla will never return the investment value to shareholders in their lifetime
BB has much potential as Tesla and GME combined
If I rent an airplane to fly around with a "BUY TESLA WITH YOUR STIMULUS" banner is that market manipulation
If this picks up any momentum at all I think retards will pile on again. We just have to wait to see the momentum. Think of how long it took Tesla. We could all be in for the long haul. If you're here for a quick gain, I think I have bad news for you.
Yeah!!  After reading that, I went in on BB, not to mention that BB is working with Tesla also.
Nio and Tesla ran together like this for a bit
Same thing happened in my portfolio this summer in consumer tech. I read it as Tesla scooping up Apple and Shopify. Charts were keeping the same shape with different magnitudes for quite a while.
I still have 25% of my portfolio in Tesla. Not sure if that stock is too hyped up.

What the shorts did was very very smart. They killed off 'outside' retail interest through media shilling etc. Essentially, they were able to trade a nuclear bomb for a hand grenade. I still hope it kills them in the end, but it likely won't be what we were all anticipating (and seeing happen on Thursday). I expect a long slow steady squeeze like Tesla. Too many comparisons to VW and it just isn't the same situation at all. The shorts will bleed this over a long long time in order to stay solvent through other trades, but the fact remains that they have to cover and if all of us don't even think about selling, the price will just rise and rise for a long time. They are shaking the tree as hard as they fucking can right now to get everything out at this low price if they can and then they unwind their positions over the next year or more as the price rises.
You forgot the part where they are making gpu‚Äôs for tesla and Elon is gonna start pumping soon.

Ahh straight is the way to selling bumpy is the path for holding.  I'm buying a tesla this year. Projected owning 1 in the next 2 years then this happens.
If I see correctly, the same applies for other stocks as well ... look at Tesla for instance (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/latest-real-time-trades) all at the same SECOND, right?

With the exception of Tesla, WSB wasn‚Äôt cult like prior to the brigade of new users. You can check DFV‚Äôs earlier posts and see how he was ridiculed. That sub was always a place to mock people for taking huge losses and people there generally didn‚Äôt take things seriously. I‚Äôm sure most of the new users were left bag holding so they will likely leave the sub out of frustration. They can fake positions but many of the older users there understand the market. They would need to do a lot of convincing. DFV was simply dumb luck. Investing in GME was always a gamble.
I def owe Elon one for pumping up GME last week. Will try to buy at least one share of Tesla
He calls it 'meme stock', jumped on the hype train not waiting for the short squeeze or even knowing about it. He bought high then sold at the first dip he met. It doesn't matter if he bought Apple, Tesla, AMC or GME. He'd lose money if he got scared by a dip.  We always knew this dip would happen, we may not have accounted for the extra ladder attacks but we knew it was coming. We wait for the squeeze. Regardless of how high or low. We hold.
I‚Äôve always loved the Dallas Mavericks. Now even more so.I want a Tesla model S for each share of GME : $69,420 ü§™üí™üí™üí™üöÄüöÄüöÄüíéüíéüíéüôåüôå
Everyone spread this out like wildfire. RobbinYou never restricted you from buying tesla stock when it short squeezed to quad digits but it did for gme.
Lol?  At $1000/share Gamestop would be a $65bn market cap company.Apple is a &gt$2 trillion company, Tesla is closing in a $1 trillion, and Netflix is $245bn.  Even at $1000/share GME wouldn't even be in the same league.Chewy, the online pet supply company Ryan Cohen founded now has a market cap of $41.7bn, and the gaming industry arguably has a far greater potential for growth going forward.  By no means is it entirely unthinkable that he can turn GME around and do for it what he did for bricks and mortar dog food lol.
What color Tesla should I get
You didn't get one yet?  Hell, we all got ours last .......... buy TSLA.   Sorry, that happens from time to tesla.  Occasionally I tesla about lingering tesla effects but so far so tesla.

I sold $30 of Tesla shares to buy 1/3 of a share. So now across US and EU markets i own 2.3 Shares at varied pricing :D Not going to be life changing at all but if i can prevent the funds from getting a share, or part of one, then fuck it. Would love to be one of the retards with like ¬£5k coming from this.
I just put More funds into my Robinhood account however, I was unaware of that since I have over 20 stock on RH they won't let me buy anymore. They wouldn't let me cancel my incoming transaction so I bought what I could of AMC. I would sell off my Tesla stock I have in Fidelity and put it in GME right now but fidelity will make me wait until the money settles because I didn't wait for the money to settle too many times already. (Selling off parts of my portfolio to get in on the dips) They might not let me buy anymore but they're not getting what I have. üíéüôå

Hell yeah pltr and tesla here
I want to thank Elon and buy a Tesla, $10,000 a share incoming
Musk as an early investor in Tesla, not a founder that‚Äôs well documented and the Eberhard lawsuit was actually settled out of court indicating at least some of his accusations where true.His parents owned an emerald mine and had so much money they couldn‚Äôt close their safe per Errols words. Further Elon had advantage at the level of apparently being able to walk into Tiffany and just sell them Emeralds.Musk jumped in as essentially an investor with pay pal (through x.com) and helped guide its growth until it was sold.He was a beneficiary of the dot.com bubble who saw potential for tech and because of the bubble was able to invest and sell. He isn‚Äôt really doing anything revolutionary that wouldn‚Äôt have happened regardless he‚Äôs just an entrepreneur who got in on the ground with some good products.He‚Äôs insightful sure but he‚Äôs more an Edison than an Einstein. Smart, again sure but no genius and certainly not worthy of worship or emulation. He‚Äôs just another oligarch.Which round table specifically? I‚Äôve seen a few an never really been that impressed, considering his business dealings he should have broad based knowledge in the areas he does (like AI, nanotechnology, battery tech etc). Being knowledgeable doesn‚Äôt make someone a genius. Is he gifted? Sure, I‚Äôve seen estimates putting his IQ around 155 but I don‚Äôt really put much stock into that. He‚Äôs smarter than average but the average person is pretty fucking stupid so again, not really impressive.
Tesla *is* better than other manufacturers. Full stop. That was a stupid thing to say.

I [did some DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lai4ax/at_least_49_of_all_trades_from_330400_havent_been/) on this yesterday and neither tesla, apple nor amazon had that much of it going on.
Because he was a rich kid with all the advantages who started out life advantaged from oppression. He steals others work and claims it as his own (he actually sued, and won, to be called a founder of Tesla... he wasn‚Äôt). He lies, cheats and steals to advance his own wealth on the backs of others all the while treating his workers no better than any other capitalist. He‚Äôs not a genius or really even an inventor, he‚Äôs just a rich guy good at marketing and branding in the age of memes. He‚Äôs just an oligarch that is cosplaying.
You can be legit and still be a meme, see Tesla.
Gme is on sale, are we gonna get it back up or is it gonna keep falling, a little worried...Looks like the smartest thing to do would be to sell all my shares in Tesla and buy a fuck ton of gmeüöÄüöÄü¶çü¶çüíé‚úã
Hi Mark,Back in June of 2020, Apple shares surged in volume after the split to 225 million, and Tesla surged over 100 million in a single day. While there were order delays, no suspensions were made that day, or the following days, as the price of Tesla continued to climb and drop violently. There were some technical issues, but no limitations. Other platforms didn't have any issues or limitations during that event.Why is the GME, AMC volume and price surge any different? They claim it's a liquidity issue, but back then, Robinhood was arguably smaller in terms of size, yet was able to handle it without suspensions, and clearinghouses didn't change deposit requirements on those companies. It's very strange to me.
Just sold my tesla stock to buy amc dip, turns out, cashapp's broker isn't allowing purchases on amcüò≥. Bs
What colour Tesla you guys buying?
They are desperate. They are reaching to their buddies to stop the free trade (Revolut joined the list of cock gobblers), they are constantly doing ladder attacks (just check out the number of stocks per transition on Nasdaq versus, let's say, Microsoft or Tesla).Like GameStop's call center told me "Please hold".

This dip means I finally bought some GME. Hold to the moon üöÄüöÄdaddy wants a new Tesla.
It just sucks because for people like me with 4 shares im just actually holding to make you and the other already wealthy people on this sub even wealthier. You got a value play but you tell people to buy at 300 and shit it seems kind of fucked up but I'm sure ill be banned for this so whatever just kind of sick of seeing it. Like obviously we're not gonna have the same experience if o buy for 300 and you bought for 30. Then you tell me were in this together but we aren't. You won't even give me a ride in your tesla when you drive by me at the bus stop but I held with my diamond hands for you so there's that.
Why did the clearing house raise the collateral to 100%, Tesla had a crazier rally and there were no trade restrictions. Fucking bastards
‚ÄúYour brain is diseased‚ÄùMade me giggle. Not because you are right or wrong, but because WSB was saying the same stuff about Tesla $420,69 and then $1000 and then $2000, until we realized that it‚Äôs actually a meme stock and rational market theories didn‚Äôt apply to it.
I panic sold at the bottom of TESLA. Biggest mistake of investing history.Same deal....I‚Äôm holding....they have to fold.
Boys 2 years ago I sold all my Tesla stock and then it shot up a bazillion percent. Do I sacrifice my GME shares so that it shoots up for y‚Äôall?
went from picking out my Tesla to borrowing the neighbors coupons...still holding !
Remeber tesla -22% day.   I think this was the last time.   Maybe sep 2nd.
üòÇ I do love the way you autists think. It‚Äôs why Tesla is where it‚Äôs at today. I‚Äôll be üíéüôåing while breathing through my hopium ventilator
All of you band wagoners and paper haned virgins just move along lmao. If you think I won't hold this stock until 0 or 10k then you have no clue what this is about. TRUE RETARDS laugh and buy more on red days. You all here acting like we are the bag holders are going to hold my bags in the future while I park my new tesla in front of your house to have some fun time with your wife. üíé‚úãüöÄüöÄüöÄ

HOLD ON and DONT LET MELVIN TRICK YOU!&amp#x200BListen! I'm deep in with 51 GEM shares @$280. I'm holding, cause I know the squeeze has to happen, BUT:We need to stop talking about **a squeeze date**! Nobody knows when this will happen. It took about 4 - 5 Months to get the VW squeeze. So the GME squeeze could be very soon (this Friday) or very late (March or April) or whenever. **The important thing is to NOT demotivating each other buy promising squeeze dates.** **You may ask why? I will share with you my thoughts:**From a psychological perspetive (I'm no expert!), if I was Melvin, I would do everything possible to prove WSB on the promised squeeze dates wrong! I would manipulate the price (ladder attack) I wouldn't use any buy volume, I would use media prior to the promised squeeze date and so on.   **WHY would I do that?**Easy: I would demotivate everybody in this group who has put in money he is not willing to lose and who expects the squeeze to happen tomorrow. I would scare everybody who needs the invested money next month to pay rent or other bills. I would bring all you guys to sell me your shares as cheap as possible. And some of us would do it, because the promised squeeze date wasn't delivered by us apes. I would also push other stocks to detract to from GME, and we are helping them with claiming wrong squeeze dates...**With every promised squeeze date we generate more and more paper hands and Melvin slowly buys day by day 200 shares, 1k shares, 2k shares, 5k shares.**   Yes we do laugh about the low volume, but if every Melvin broker buys 1k shares for under $200 they are getting them cheaper and are avoiding the damn squeeze.**AND I WANT MY DAMN SQEEUZE!! I promised my kitty a brand new tesla.** So stop panic selling, educate yourself and stop promising SQUEEZE DATES!!! It happens when it happens!!LETS SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND STAY STRONG TOGETHER. The squeeze will happen, if we stay strong.WE NEED A LONG BREATH. Don¬¥t listen to me I'm stupid as hell and just love this stock.
It‚Äôs comparing apples and oranges. Pretty much the same as saying GME will go to 800 because Tesla did
Time to start canceling those Tesla preorders
FUCK IT IM SELLING MY ENTIRE TESLA POSITION FOR MORE GME
So I mentioned Tesla and immediately got bot accusations like cmon , I‚Äôm still holding my GME but cmon
Holding my GME. Picked up some UPS prior to their quarterly earnings this evening and some  Tesla stock which I'm going long on
Tesla was highest shorting volume for several years but the % of short to float was quite a bit lower than in GME still. It was way a way close call where the brokers didn't give out more shares to short than they had. See if the company really goes brankrupt all go to 0% anyway so it doesn't matter how many shorts were going around.  but now since 140% GME were going around and not enough people selling. when DTC, the world's largest securities depository, is blocking buys. That is in my mind pretty much prove that there is a massive shortage of shares going around. &amp#x200Bbut I am just a retarded ape
In a move fueled by FOMO and retardation I bought more shares at a peak yesterday, fucking up my point of entry from $90 to $200. That being said, **it's only a loss if I sell** so I am planning to hold.I have learned this lesson from Tesla a few months ago - as a noob investor I sold all my shares out of frustration at like $450, a few weeks before it blasted to over $800.
Like all kinds of people did with Tesla like 3 months ago, and we were all astonished how god damn rich they were and how dumb we were that we didn't think of it?These guys literally took the furthest out call option available and shoveled their net worth into it, which *should* be fucking retarded.
GME and AMC dip for one day and now you guys think it‚Äôs finished? You must be the same people who thought Tesla was going to $50 last April
That‚Äôs same as Tesla back then, only certain platform allow you to short. RH is trash üóë.
i will cum in a spoon and eat it if tesla opens at 900
I heard that Nikola Tesla died as an 86 year old virgin. I think that with today's modern medicine &amp technology, I can easily become a 100 year old virgin
If it dips more I am liquidating TESLA and the last of my "alternate-currency" and buying the dip for my 3rd buy-in!!! HOLD! That being said:Only invest what you are willing to lose. Here, now, or on any other type of investment opportunity.I've seen way too many posts about people that have invested student loans and their retirement/pension fund. I've been contacted by people that are scared shitless after betting their whole future on this. I'm in $10k now. But this is money I have liquidated from other investments. This is "will I change my car in the next year or not" money. This is somenthing you can hold. Don't invest your emergency fund, house payment, rent payment, credit card debt, school loans, children's education fund, retirement fund, etc. Basically anything that will decrease your current standard of living by a lot or isn't actually your money anymore.

First, they came for Ironyman. I didn‚Äôt speak out because I didn‚Äôt know what a box spread was. Then, they came for the Tesla call holders. I didn‚Äôt speak out because I didn‚Äôt think it could go higher in a recession. Then, they came for the GME investors. I didn‚Äôt speak out because I didn‚Äôt baghold. Then, one day, they came for me. As I looked around over a sea of culled noobs with VVS hands, I heard a whisper. It was a mod telling me ‚ÄúFinish it mr. oompaloompa‚Äù And so I did. And so we will rebuild as those before us did.
He better Yolo his gainz on tesla calls
Why is this such a big deal right now and when Tesla blew up this didn‚Äôt happen ?
Lol I appreciate your response but that is not how an etf works. You can't buy SPY and ask for your fair share of Tesla cake. Same as you can't buy an etf and ask for your gme cake
How can you retrieve the underlying in an ETF? The etf buys those shares to balance the portfolio. You can't just buy SPX and ask for delivery on say Tesla shares without ruining their balance.
Tesla time motherfuckers quit sleepin on based god
Yep. I've never seen prices ricochet like that. It was insanity and definitely not organic. I've watched tesla on the busiest days in it's history, the volume is way higher and the buys/sells less erratic

Reminds me of the short selling vs Tesla last summer
It's not correct to value Tesla the same way you would value a software company capable of exponential growth. The auto market has different rules -- it is highly capital intensive, very crowded and intensely dependent on brand loyalty and numerous qualitative factors beyond the mere propulsion system.
Toyota is likely to be the first one out with a solid state battery, one thing that could kill Tesla in the medium term. To imagine that the entire EV/AV market could be dominated by a single company is absurd.
Tesla was range bound for five years, and it had fundamentals that kept on improving along with a very bright future.Gamestop doesn't have that same potential, and this is purely a technical event.Trade on that as you will.
Too much meme stock talk and nobody noticed Tesla got a PT of $1,200 and is up 6% today.
Google Translation:How the gamestop drama sucks the hedge fundsSeveral dead in the onset of winter in the northeastern United StatesPrivate investors have put hedge funds like Melvin Capital under massive pressure. The fund lost a lot of money. Pictured: the New York skyline. (Photo: Seth Wenig / dpa)Private investors are rehearsing the uprising and it is becoming increasingly clear what that means: Hedge funds are said to have already lost $ 20 billion because stocks in companies such as Gamestop are climbing into crazy spheres. Can the online rebels hold out?By Jannis Br√ºhl, Harald Freiberger and Nils WischmeyerEndless drama: The share price of the video game chain Gamestop jumped wildly back and forth on Monday. In the afternoon, the share was twelve percent in the red at 241 euros. Before that, the rate had risen from 14 to 285 euros within a few days, i.e. it had increased twenty-fold.What at first looks like a typo was caused by financial bets that got out of hand. According to calculations by the analysis platform S3 Partners, hedge funds have already lost 20 billion dollars (16.6 billion euros) to the attack by private investors it was said to have been eight billion dollars last Friday alone.Company Already "pitched" today?languageAlready "pitched" today?In the German economy gibberish is spoken - a mix of Anglicisms and pseudo-philosophical platitudes. Management consultants shape the fashions. But a manager holds against it.By Hendrik MunsbergThe hedge fund Melvin Capital suffered the most from the price jumps. He lost more than half of his invested assets in January, insiders reported: At the beginning of the month, 12.5 billion dollars had been reported, at the end of the month only a good eight billion dollars. This includes a $ 2.75 billion cash injection that Melvin Capital received from two other hedge funds, Point 72 and Citadel, to cover the losses. Citron Research, a company specializing in short sales, has now even renounced its old core business entirely after speculating with bets against Gamestop."Is anyone holding you hostage right now?"The hedge funds had bet with so-called short sales that the prices of Gamestop and other stocks such as AMC Entertainment or Nokia will fall. On the online platform Reddit, young private investors in particular agreed to counter this by buying shares. They got the prices to start rising. The hedge funds then had to stock up on shares in the companies concerned in order to avoid further losses, which drove the prices on and on - a classic short squeeze, as it is called in stock market jargon.The course of Gamestop is now so unrealistically high that there is a risk of a crash. It can only be kept up as long as there are buyers, so as long as hedge funds have to continue to meet their obligations from the short sale transactions. The analysis house S3 Partners assumes that the stocks sold short could fall below the limit of 30 million, significantly less than a few weeks ago. According to the financial portal Marketbeat, there were 61 million short-sold Gamestop shares on January 15.Gamestop 4 p.m. Open detailed viewOn Thursday, the US broker Robinhood stopped buying Gamestop shares and papers from other affected companies such as Nokia or the US cinema chain AMC because of the upheavals - much to the annoyance of the Reddit rebels, because the price was frozen. That, in turn, gave hedge funds some breathing space. "Is anyone holding you hostage right now?", Elon Musk asked his interlocutor Vlad Tenev, the founder and boss of Robinhood. The two spoke to each other on Sunday evening via the Clubhouse app, and Musk was only half joking. The Tesla boss is something like the icon of the self-proclaimed "army" of online private investors."Well, if that was a gun-on-the-head situation ..."So have hedge funds put pressure on the comparatively small broker apps to restrict purchases of stocks that the big professional funds have bet against? This theory preoccupies many of the private investors who suddenly could not buy more on Thursday. Tenev denied this and replied that no one was holding him hostage: "Thanks for asking."The National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) contacted him on Thursday night. This so-called clearinghouse, which is licensed by the stock exchange supervisory authority, ensures the technical processing of stock exchange transactions and requires collateral for this. Tenev said the NSCC suddenly asked for $ 3 billion because of the many deals caused by the retail investor boom. Robinhood has only raised $ 2 billion in venture capital so far. To negotiate down the NSCC's claim until Robinhood received an additional Milliarde had found, they had promised to limit the sales of the affected shares. The clearinghouse was so appeased. Musk, informally on behalf of the online investors, that seemed to be enough at first: "Well, if that was a gun-on-the-head situation ..."Tenev also denied another theory of angry private investors who were keen to buy the trending stocks: the rumor that the giant finance and hedge fund company Citadel could have been putting pressure on the NSCC in the background to stop the short squeeze and the Protect the interests of the hedge funds. As a so-called market maker, Citadel plays a central role in many stock exchange transactions. Such a market maker brings buy and sell orders together and lives from the spread between the buy and sell prices. The higher the trading volume, the greater the profit. Not only does most of Robinhood's business run through Citadel, the company also stepped in with billions in aid for the tumbling hedge fund Melvin Capital."We did this to stabilize our own system"The Berlin broker Trade Republic also stopped trading with Gamestop, AMC Entertainment and Co. on Thursday at 5:30 p.m. "We did this to stabilize our own system," said a spokeswoman for the SZ. The number of orders for these shares was so high at that time - several thousand shares per minute - that the orders overloaded the trading system. "By stopping, we made it possible for our customers to continue trading that evening." The stop lasted almost five hours. "Overnight we significantly expanded our capacities so that trading in all stocks was fully possible again the next morning," said the spokeswoman.There were new swings on the stock exchange on Monday. This time it was about silver. The price of the precious metal rose by more than ten percent to an eight-year high of $ 30.03 per troy ounce (31.1 grams). "The Reddit community has targeted a bigger whale by trying to trigger a 'short squeeze' on the silver market," said analyst Kyle Rodda of brokerage firm IG. Market analyst Milan Cutkovic from the brokerage house Axi warned: "The problem is that this market is much larger and the participants are here with very deep pockets." However, members of the Reddit forum defended themselves against the theory that they wanted to force a "silver squeeze" and that the community did not call for people to buy the precious metal.And what do professional short sellers say? Fahmi Quadir is a hedge fund manager and became famous for betting early on against Wirecard and then cashing in when the fraud scandal involving the German company was exposed. About the Gamestop case, the 30-year-old at SZ says that professionals are unlikely to be intimidated by the price fluctuations: "Other investors besides Melvin have probably seen the extreme price increase as an opportunity to build up new short positions." The profit was certainly not only made by private investors and newcomers to the stock exchange, but also by other hedge funds: "That's the old story: If one billionaire is wrong on the stock market, another billionaire who is on the other side of the deal will get richer."Quadir, who always defends her short sales as a corrective for the market, praises those private investors who have brought their hedge fund colleagues to their knees for the time being: "Your great achievement is that you have shown that the market has developed into a casino. You have revealed malfunctions in pricing in the market. "
Does anyone who followed Tesla closely know - did these hedge funds try to short ladder Tesla too? Obviously, if they did, it didn't work with Tesla and so GME could follow  a similar path where eventually the hedge funds just cannot supress it forever?
üëâ‚ú®I got 10k invested. I‚Äôm 4K down. I Could buy myself a nice piece of shit Toyota Camry. I‚Äôll hold until zero or I‚Äôm buying a Tesla Model S and getting launched to the moon.
Nonsense we chase gains here no matter what the play. This year the sub has gone from a Tesla bull cult, to a Microsoft bull cult, to a drill team 6 cult, to an Amazon bull cult, back to Tesla, corn gang for some reason, and you get the gist. The only thing permanent is that for every autist who gets lucky and makes bank 100 retards go down in flames trying to replicate.
you sound like a bot bro. In case your not,Look at the share purchases on the Nasdaq. Ladder attacks (quantity orders of a 100, same price, same millisecond). Occasionally they toss a random number to throw you off. Occasionally someone‚Äôs stop loss limit hits. Look at the average volume of GME (how much volume is distributed per day - based off the last 50 days). Typically it‚Äôs 106 million, but today it was just 36 million. Why? Many brokerages are limiting or preventing sales of GME. Hedge funds are big customers of theres and there is no reason to screw them over. **The reason HFs are not buying them is that they are...they are selling the float they do have to the other HF. Back and forth in quick succession. With the market limited on popular trading platforms and people not being able to leave RH (and some aren‚Äôt due to not giving a shit about not being able to invest in a meme stock).**These guys have been pros for years and they know how to manipulate the market and are doing their best right now. They know they are fucked if people hold, there isn‚Äôt much float (total amount of publicly traded stocks available) and they oversold on puts/shorts (betting that a stock would go down).Why would RH allow the unlimited sale of Silver (if that‚Äôs the new crazy Reddit trend) while limiting GME and AMC. Because they want you to get fucked. Some spy coming in here with his 100 bot friends that go my paid 20 bucks an hour to say silver is dope. This subreddit has grown from 3 million to 8 million and I can tell you it‚Äôs not all just newly retarded children. Want a great example of a recent short squeeze that people haven‚Äôt been mentioning too much (I see a lot of reference to Volkswagen, but there was an earlier one).It‚Äôs called Tesla. Tesla was one of the highest shorted stocks and it was infamous for it. When is retards bought it basing it off hype and DD (due diligence), Tesla went up in value tremendously. As shorts had to exit their position after failing to try to drop it down, they had to cover. Tesla went up. Now us retards told our autistic aunts and uncles to invest. Shorts once again had to cover. Then Tesla kept getting hyped as the most undervalued stock. Our autistic aunts and uncles, told their coworkers and hookers to invest, and Tesla became the beast it was today.
Not fucking selling I believe in everyone holding the stock... only reason it‚Äôs down is because the hedge funds are manipulating the market but they won‚Äôt have as much control as they did today! One fuck up and boom they‚Äôll be sending us to the moon! My parents need their house paid off and I‚Äôm gonna put them in a Tesla on top of thatüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ DON‚ÄôT SELL I BELIEVE IN ALL OF YOU we will go to the top üíéüíéüíéü§ùü§ùü§ùü§ùüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ and don‚Äôt forget to put some of your profits towards good and giving back to less fortunate or whoever may be in need.
S3 are shills for hedge funds, look at there website they're products are targeted at big finance not retail. They will publish what they are told, they did this with Tesla back in the day they suddenly when the real data came out there algorithm self corrected with "new data".  Total BS.
I'm with you brotha.  Bought 100 shares at 3:59 by selling some Tesla covered calls.
And you can safely ignore them. There is no "growth" that tesla could POSSIBLY have that would even remotely justify their valuation. If the price went down an order of magnitude, we would STILL be talking about complete and utter world automotive domination.But seriously, you aren't missing anything. Tesla has a high stock price because people saw the stock price go up and bought stock. You'll be given a lot of BS justifications just like you would for any other bubble, but it's a bubble. In the case of tesla the justifications also tend to be along the lines of "sure, they don't actually have anyone on payroll working on a social media site, but just you wait, in 10 years tesla social media is going to make facebook look small!"
Spam twitter... let's get Elon on board the real rocket!!! @elonmusk  invest $50 million and shoot Gamestop to the moon!! Remember when they tried to kill @Tesla ??? #buythedip
My personal opinion on Tesla:Tesla is a company who has not yet realized its full potential growth. Toyota is a company that has, in theory, realized its potential and is mature. For a company that has already realized its potential, a healthy P/E has historically been around 20-30 depending on industry. For a growth company, you automatically take on more risk because it has not yet proven it can make the money envisioned. In these cases a P/E up to 60-80 has historically been acceptable assuming you find some reason to believe in the company and can accept that they may not succeed. Some people say P/E is less important now... and that same thing has been said in every mature bull market in history yet its still around somehow. (I like the ratio).A P/E of Tesla's level is almost unheard of historically except for the DotCom bubble of the late 90s (and we know how those stocks turned out). Tesla would have to carve out an enormous share of the automotive industry to meet the earnings required to justify that price. So the big question is, can they do that? Maybe... but I think people are forgetting that success breeds competition and there are lots of other, proven-to-be-successful, auto manufacturers out there with well laid out EV plans and no shortage of talent. Tesla has a moat because it has made a good brand for itself, and has been very aggressive, but it will start to see plenty of other competitors on the market that make comparable or even better vehicles and many will be at much lower costs.So, I believe Tesla is significantly overvalued because I don't believe it can carve out the share of the automotive market that it needs to to justify its capitalization. This is not to say the stock won't continue to rise in this highly-leveraged, low-interest rate environment (there is plenty of other crazy stuff going on right now), but I have yet to be convinced these levels are even remotely justified. Its not like they have the only patent on EVs. I'd much rather invest in Toyota myself. (Not financial advice, I have no holdings in either Tesla or Toyota).To your comment about seeing Tesla's everywhere, I think its a regional thing. I rarely see them where I live and if I do it is always wealthy people who have them, even after the release of their more "affordable" models. Why spend that much on an EV when I can get a 50 mile/gal diesel Jetta that's only a few years old for 10k or less?
The only thing I wouldn‚Äôt agree with doing is selling off Tesla other than that aye!!!
I‚Äôm buying the DIP ON GAMESTOP also Tesla üíé
 [Koreans Buy Tesla, GameStop as Foreign Stock Buying Hits Record (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/koreans-buy-tesla-gamestop-as-foreign-stock-buying-hits-record/ar-BB1diskp)
I think you're right to some extent. The whole situation stinks, and it's not clear to me how well connected all the pieces are, but if RH goes down, you can bet there'll be significantly less options activity. Also watch for WSB to get banned and decentralized--I think that's a surprisingly large risk for valuations of companies like Tesla.
I really hope that GameStop makes some sort of public announcement about the whole situation, because at the moment a lot of people will still be thinking that GameStop is an average/declining game store. It can be so much more with this new influx of support and the money that comes with it, they could become a global seller both online and in stores, and host eSports off of the back of a booming gaming business. If they came out with a ambitious business plan explaining all of this to the masses we could have a Tesla situation in which investors are willing to pay more than normal for shares in the hope that the company's growth in the next few years will make up for it.
Oh no a dip.. Anyway.. still wondering what color/model tesla i should get? With those incoming tendies.. Any advice?
Thanks for the surprise sale today fuckers, now I can buy a 2nd tesla. One for earth and one for the moooon üöÄ
I lived through the Tesla swings, I'll live through the GameStop swings
Honestly a 40% dip in gme is a god send. It‚Äôs like tesla dip during rona. I‚Äôm down bout 20% on my shares but guess what, they‚Äôre ducking shares hold
Thanks for the insight. This was really helpful.Is SpaceX and Tesla cross-pollenating actually legal? Not sure about how that works.
Tesla is considered a "growth" stock while Toyota is a "mature" stock.Tesla isn't being judged on today's profits but what people think its profits will be in the future, while Toyota is judged on today's profits. Most people think Tesla will increase its market share by significant amounts. Tesla currently sells less then 1% of world wide cars. In 2035, what will be Tesla's market share? Will it "just" increase 1000% to 10%? Will EVs become the most dominate type of car and Tesla's EV market share is 81% in the US currently could it have that type of market share world wide for all cars? By investing in Tesla are investors going to get some backdoor profits from SpaceX? SpaceX is not a publicly traded company even though lots of people want to invest in it and some see investing in Tesla as the next best thing. Do you think Tesla full self driving is going to be the dominant self driving company or will that go to Waymo? Or will there be multiple self driving companies that are all roughly the same?Lastly do you think that Tesla has a moat around battery technology? The same way that no other company can touch Google in search because they gained a technology lead then continued to invest in it. Now pretty much no other company really tries and rivers Google search. Maybe Tesla batteries will be the same. How you as an investor answer those questions leads you to how you would value the stock. There is alot of ifs and questions surrounding Tesla, someone is going to be right and billions of dollars are at stake in figuring who is right.
S3 have a bad record, I traded Tesla back when it was $300 before the split and there algorithm was way off, it seemed to self correct when the official numbers were out.  Luckily Tesla longs held strong. Ignore it.

Oh yeah - I was part of the April bears y‚Äôall were definitely laughing at us. But I rode Tesla to the moon today so it‚Äôs cool.
Let‚Äôs create a petition asking Musk to buy out GME or acquire GME! Tesla super charging stations at GameStop with a gaming Parlour.
If musk buys in shares or buys out GME, it‚Äôll skyrocket. His name is enough to make the shorts run for cover. After that, he can raise money by issuing additional shares and use the money to expand the business. We will also buy a Tesla with the money!
Gonna wave at all the üìÉüëê here from my Tesla in a couple days. Gonna be driving my wife's boyfriend to the airport.
Holding GME, AMC and BB.Buying more Tesla.Long on Magnite, amd, mtsi, clover, lemonade, and microsoft.
It‚Äôs like getting pre-split Tesla at below $250
Well I guess if Tesla recovered from its dump all the way down to 780$ I‚Äôm sure GME with its short squeeze will make a comeback this week
When you have Warren buying up Tesla very conveniently before an announcement like oh say, the military shifting to electric... yeah my smooth brain is telling me that‚Äôs a little fishy and shows mainstream media‚Äôs loyalty

As a 10YR tesla investor.  It's been an amazing lesson seeing how incredibly full of lies the financial media is.  All media.  Now with this seeing it all over my new feed.  Unbelievable.    Why is there no talking head on the news calling them on the utter BS lie?
It was Melvin Capital who went after Tesla for years and was extremely vocal about it. Not a lot of difference there I understand, but when this started he was taking some shots at Melvin directly due to this.

Would drop the nuts on the lady that didn't believe in Tesla
Man GME dying is so funny. I sold this morning locked in profits and rolled into Tesla plug arkk and arkg
Even better, this is personal for him. Citadel is the same hedge fund that was going after tesla stock and trying to short them for years.
Except for that pussy that posted a picture of his Tesla order.
It‚Äôs 2030. You‚Äôre sitting in your Tesla roadster playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17: artificial Intelligence on the GameStop-integrated 40 gigateraflop gaming rig while it autopilots you to Wendy‚Äôs. Life is good.
God it's nice to see a Tesla post. Congrats.Edit - and fuck you.
Me! Sold my tesla stock for gamestop and Amc
So does Ford.In 2019 Tesla spent $1.3 Billion on R&ampD while Ford spent $7.4 Billion.
#### WHEN THIS IS OVER I'M USING MY GAINS TO BUY A TESLA WITH LICENSE PLATE "TNX GME"
i got you. looking at your older posts, losing money on tesla, lol who does that? wipeass paper hands!
I would agree with all except downing Tesla. Usually it's the first to consumer that will dominate the market. Look how many competitors NETFLIX has, and you'll see why this theory doesn't hold water as well as you think it would.  Tesla is the innovative car company, Ford can't take that from them even with electric.  Still a good buy though
Probably not that much. In order for this to impact their bottom line they‚Äôd have to sell millions of chips to Tesla. Tesla is selling 500k cars a year. I don‚Äôt think this as big of deal as ppl think.
Everyone should tweet Elon musk to flex his Tesla muscles and buy GME!

(Warning ... I am an ape, so you can't sue apes... )Hold on to GME. Dont sell. Dont consider selling. Anyone who'd held on since Wednesday know the hedge funds short ladder gme, gme goes down, then bounces right back up. Patience is the key to winning this game and sending the hedge funds down to the pits of hell. Also be patience with the short squeeze. It will come in due time. At this point if everyone HOLDS on to their gme shares no matter what, we will be looking back at the moon as we soar past the tesla roadster, and head to Pluto, where we take a gas break to piss, and then then rocket to the unknown. $10,000k /share is not only possible now, but is an almost certain.

Hold my AMC and Tesla calls?
So will my children, Elon Tesla and GameStopina.
Yes, F is going to be a great buy as the market changes to EV and Autonomous vehicles. Same with GM imo. Funny how people chase these EV companies that make no money, have no factories and think they will be disrupters. LOL. No, once the big guys like Ford, GM make the switch they'll stay the top dogs. They have the factories, they have the connections, they have the experience and they have the branding. Is the normie guy going to by a TESLA work truck? Probably not, but they would by a Ford F150 electric because it's Ford.
Just bought AMC.  Why not!  Daddy needs a new pair of shoes and a TESLA
This has to be the final test. They want to see if we‚Äôll abandon our old friend Tesla to continuing holding... we must.. we must hold through this. And if you are able hop in with Tesla too but go long
CNN and lying.....name a better duo.I remember those early Tesla articles you lying tendie thieves!!!!

It‚Äôs the year 2031, I get on my Gamestop Airlines flight departing from New Gamestop and landing on Los Gamestop, as I drive my Tesla home.

I look him deep in the eyes and tell him ‚ÄúWhere he goes, I go, if he holds the line, I‚Äôm standing right next to him‚Äù.
I read that Tesla is going to be exclusively using AMD chip sets in their 2022 models. I wonder how much this will increase their value. I've been contemplating buying myself at 86$ right now.

Fucking finally with some damn sense around here. It‚Äôs starting to feel like a cult that‚Äôs half as rational as the Tesla fanboys and my god they‚Äôre some fuckin nutty people to begin with.
guys something really cool to remember is if you continue to hold your shares you ACTUALLY own a piece of GameStop, not just some set of numbers on the computer. all their future success under Cohen (which has been mute this entire run) will come back to shareholders. this reminds me of how tesla was beaten down FOR YEARS by shorts because they couldn't look at future growth prospects. now im not saying that to make you think this is tesla, they are vastly different situations and industries but the basics of " growing company/turn around story hated by suits not doing their dd" when in reality the company has a really healthy outlook and management team makes me think the stock can stay high like it is on sentiment alone if investors (thats what you are now) believe and hold and let Cohen work his magic.this may take a while, if you have life changing profits take some! id recommend scaling out both to look for best price and to keep pressure on the suits, but if majority of highly motivated and vested individuals maintain a majority long position this will end well, i dont feel soon, but well.these people have tons of money, tons , the news, the talking heads, everyone, but they did when it came to tesla too.Ape strong together, 43 shares cost average 163. First entered at 19, came back later at 43, i plan to maintain a position to see if the above scenario will play out
I just need TSLA to hit 1000 today.. and AMD to hit 100.. Is that too much to ask?Also, if you're looking for another play instead of going full retard and going all-in on one stock, look at Tesla Calls. Buy now for about 3 or 4 weeks out. It will run back up to 900
you miss the context. Every 3 weeks some retard figures out that SLV is undervalued, bets big on it and gets crushed. 1 year here and Ive seen it multiple times. It is like shorting Tesla.

I‚Äôm buying a Tesla after the GME situation is done
 I bought gme and amc at their peak,  170 GME @ $340  300 AMC @ $18  I bled money last week. I was very scared. I lost sleep, I shit my pants. The smell drove my family away. My hand feverishly hovered over the "Sell" button multiple times, but then I had an epiphany, true retard-ness is not the absence of fear. It's holding your ground despite the fear. So, I held.  Last time I pussied out of Tesla, and AMD due to impatience and others talking me out of it, but I realize the name of the game is diamond hands.I came across [DFV's reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1g7x0/hey_burry_thanks_a_lot_for_jacking_up_my_cost/) everyone called him an idiot for longing gme, but my man did not flinch.To the moon and beyond my fellow soldiers. $gme, $amc show me the money this week.  remember to hold, and not fold.

Don‚Äôt sleep on Tesla ! Just know 1000 will be coming
Yeah he has to consult his attorneys or a something before he tweets about Tesla from now. But Papa Musk can tweet about $GME anytime he wants. Kthxbye.
I bought way too many Tesla calls on Friday. Cmon elon, show ‚Äòem who the real meme lord is.
have you been in a coma for the past week?their ceo went on tv last MONDAY stating that they secured funds to keep them in good shape for 2021. and that was BEFORE they raised more money via stock issuances.next you‚Äôre going to tell me that tesla won‚Äôt hit $800 post split
Shut up boomer, go short Tesla.
You're not dumb. It took me a while to reason about this. While it's true that investors buy growth stocks in the hope that someone later on down the line will pay more for their shares, it differs from a Ponzi scheme because it is possible that everyone can benefit.Companies are valued in different ways, but a simplified way of valuing a company is the [discounted cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) model. For dividend stocks this is much easier to calculate. It's why slow-growing companies that distribute dividends have stock prices that fluctuate much less. People are more or less in agreement about the value of that company. Growth-oriented companies are a different beast altogether. How big will Amazon be in a few years? What about Tesla? Nobody knows for sure. Investors have wildly different predictions about the future of these companies, and one major achievement or setback throws off these predictions and often moves the stock price. Eventually, these companies (in theory) will not have an efficient place to invest profit back into the company and will decide to distribute dividends. Now the valuation is more certain because of the discounted cash flow model. The thing is, all along the way the investors that purchased shares of that company had their own ideas of what the company's future valuation would be. They then determined if it was a worthy investment based on the price, taking into account the incurred risk of the company not meeting their expectations. You buy a growth stock when you are comfortable shouldering the burden of increased risk for a potential higher return. If the company is on track to meet or exceed your expectations at purchase time, you come out on top. If not, you lose out.Be aware that this is a vast simplification of stock valuation, but I hope it helps to paint a clearer picture. Another reason certain stocks have value is their voting rights. The relatively small influence of retail investors might not matter much, but if a large institution wants to take over a company they will be more willing to pay a premium for your shares.
You know what I thinkTesla SpaceX and GameStop to do a partnershipNever sell imo own GameStop put a GameStop on the moon for real make the meme a realityWe own gme r/gme_boardroom
I bought 40 shares of Tesla in 2013 and it is my forever hold. Hopefully, it has another 5:1 split one day and I'll hold 1000 shares. It's my primary retirement nest egg that isn't my 401K lol
If it gets to $1500 that will be enough for a down payment on a house and a Tesla üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
if papa Musk is worried, he'll tweet 'i like tesla' and stonks go brrrrr
One of my favorite stocks. I have made money from Tesla.
Isn‚Äôt Michael Burry short Tesla right now?
Thinking of selling 6 of my 79 tesla shares to use as ammo on GME.. unless it moons premarket then im pure diamond hands

I bought the fuck out of that EOD Tesla dip on Friday.  Can not wait to see big green numbers.
There is also a simple fact that silver is a highly used industrial metal of which more and more is and will be needed by Tesla and others to power the EV revolution among other sectors. There is a massive physical supply problem going on that is putting the screws to the paper trade that JPM fucks with daily.They don't build cars out of GME, folks.
Tesla to $1k by Friday! TSLA
The GME squeeze is cool and all, butIm not gonna lie, I miss the old WSB where you could actually find new DD and great plays on a daily basis. Although I guess it was exactly the same crap last year during the Tesla squeeze and we managed to come back to somewhat normalcy after that, so hopefully we can do the same after GME. Or Maybe I‚Äôm just an old timer yelling at kids on my lawn, idk.
Yep, and then gaming sections inside for people to try out new games or w/e while they wait for their tesla they bought with GME shares to charge
Losses on paper don‚Äôt mean shit. People here who held Tesla calls the week before the S&ampP inclusion know.I wouldn‚Äôt have sold until my portfolio said -90% because I knew something big was coming for it to be so red on a market wide green. I got downvoted to all hell for recommending Tesla calls that week until it fucking mooned and I was 800% up.Melvin just keeps doubling, tripling, down on shorts because they think they‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs not enough for you guys to hold when they keep getting billions in cash infusions. You gotta buy more or it won‚Äôt do shit. You guys have to make them see -90% or they won‚Äôt even budge.Not financial advice.

Hahahaha amazing. My buddy I showed options to back in dec. His wife forgot that had Tesla stock from years ago. She put like $600 in. They were sitting at 10k in dec. Idk what it is now.
yOu‚ÄôRe ObViOuSlY a BoT!In all seriousness, half the people here don‚Äôt know anything about what‚Äôs going on, they are just scared they‚Äôre going to be the ones holding the GME bag when it tanks. Chances are, many of them will be, it‚Äôs just a matter of how many of them are willing to do that for the cause.I‚Äôve been long on silver at higher levels than anything else in my portfolio, because the current price of silver makes literally no sense. The manipulation of the silver market will end eventually, and I‚Äôm gonna be there for it when it does. Especially considering the FED is printing money faster than a Tesla Roadster hits 60mph.

you dont understand because you are üßªüëê b*tch.If we HOLD until May, the GME is gonna weight shitton more in Russell 2000 and any other ETF and will be bought up real fast. If we hold for another quarter, then the proce will spike and will be reweighted even bigger share of these indexes. Then we dont have to hold anymkre, although most people would prefer to hold for the smoller tax billlJust look up tesla short squeeze
Another perspective  about diversification I agree with is that it's selling the winner to buy the losers. Why sell Apple to diversify with IBM or HP or dell? Why sell Tesla to diversify with other manufacturers? It's admitting you  have no idea what you are doing so you go with all the choices instead of few or one good choices.
I could just post, "Buying X and HOLDING!"  but let me paint a word picture. Tonight feels like the night before Christmas. Not because we're guaranteed presents the next day but due to the anticipation. Will we get coal or a Tesla 3/X/Y?I worked all weekend and I'm off Monday and Tuesday. Possibly the best two days this week to be off. I'm going to wake up a couple of hours before open. Brew a full pot of coffee, walk my Irish Wolfhound, and meditate.   I'll buy whatever amount of GME another $1,500 will get. Then sit in front of my computer playing Genshin Impact on one screen with my accounts and this sub on another. See you on the other side of Monday you beautiful bastards.
Yeah yeah I‚Äôm holding gme and even have been rolling weekly calls. So I‚Äôm committed with retarded risk. However this month has a shit ton of earnings. Tesla and Apple dipped hard will amazon so the same?
SHREK GREEN. TESLA 900üöÄ APPLE 150 üöÄ
Can i still get my tesla
I started a year ago by putting 16k into TSLA that I didn't have (used credit cards).  I'm sitting at about half a million now, having used earlier gains to pay off all my debt and by myself a nice P100D tesla and a performance model 3 along the way.  If gamestop goes to 1k+ I'll be the first millionaire in my immediate family.The best part?  I never even graduated college.  Suck it STEM nerds!
Stop talking like that. It‚Äôs a defeatist attitude that permeates into others‚Äô psyche for no purpose other than spread fear. I am a realist myself, but right now, the little guy holds the political clout, not the hedge funds. There is also a shifting paradigm amongst the elite. Why do you think Tesla actually survived the massive short attack, or people like Chamath are front and center and his companies are industry changing ones?
BB is the new fiverr... maybe Tesla.
Tesla 1000c 6/18 .... damn feels good to be back
Melvin now doing short ladder attacks on the daily thread. Don't listen. üíéüëê Fuck slv, amc, bb, aapl, tesla, futures, war, poverty, wall st, aids, hempatitis c, covid-19 (all strains), people with weird sexual fetishes, bears, Melvin capital, steve cohen, mods, termites, r/investing, robinhood, u/variation-separate, and lehman brothers
Every GS could have tesla charging stations in every parking space
Wsb was just destroyed by Wall Street. We were able to front run Wall Street on stocks like Tesla, nio, pltr, gme, plug, lcln, fuel cell, the trade desk, wsb was even on Amazon a couple of years ago before it really blew up. Knowing we will probably never get that type of success again with all the new people making it way easier to front run wsb makes me kinda sad ngl.
It‚Äôs the next Tesla. Tesla for gamers. Actually Elon will probably acquire GME installing their future platform onto every Tesla. GME could be worth trillions
Wait, isn't GME the ticker for Tesla? What did I buy?
ELON PROGRAM THE TESLA WERE GOING TO AMC I LIKE MOVIES
Any chance Elon musk announces a partnership with GameStop for the games in the Tesla?
I really don't have an opinion on AMC.  I haven't done the homework on AMC.  If you listen to DFV's livestreams, often when someone asks him his opinion on something, he'll respond that he's not really dialed in to it, and that's how AMC is for me.  My expertise is brick-and-mortar retailers that are unfairly unvalued, and while I have a superficial understanding of everything else, it's not enough to have an actionable opinion.However, if I were to start looking into AMC from a value perspective, what I'd consider most would be its debt, upcoming movie releases, and whether there's a "pent-up demand" to go out and do things once things open up, or if the last year has caused a permanent change in behavior.  Regarding the debt, usually, the stock price doesn't affect the way the business is run.  But when the debt is really high, a higher stock price allows the company to raise money by selling shares and paying off the debt, and this actually improves the company's condition.  This happened with Tesla as well.  But things could go either way.  I thought that GameStop being valued at $200-300 million **for the entire company** was absurd, given how much net cash they had and how much they were going to make in the first few years of a console cycle.  I don't have a sense of how AMC will go.  Honestly, if I were to look into another of the meme stocks, I'd look into BB, but that's only because I already looked into them in 2013-2015 when their turnaround started, so I have a head start from a homework perspective.  Around that time, I bought some, but obviously I was hilariously way early, and then sold.
Counterfeiting securities is or should be basically money laundering. Money laundering is fucking illegal. This NEEDS to be addressed.After GME and AMC, we as a collective body of 7.6 million degenerates NEED to make a FUCKTON of noise politically (I know we don't talk that here) to get this addressed. Hedges should not be allowed to pull shares out of their ass at nearly any number they want and use them to conduct ladder attacks against stocks by over leveraging their positions to short a company to suck investor dollars out for personal gain.What happens if Tesla goes to $1Tn tomorrow, and hedges conspire through Counterfeited securities and drive down the value of the company from $1Tn to $850Bn? They would suck 150Bn out of the market using fabricated "value" and make off with real value.That's insane.
I mean executives should be issuing shares for a cash infusion to be taking advantage of the stock price. Like Tesla did in 2020.
To buy someone here a yacht and myself a Tesla Edit: TO BUY EVERYONE YACHTS
Imagine not buying GameStop at $300?!2022: Tesla merged with GameStop to bring games to Mars
I see this downtrend continuing until this GME squeeze is over. Perhaps monthly puts are the play for now, capitalize on this fear, then switch to calls , specifically leaps on aapl, Tesla, etc. Thoughts?

If you guys missed out on Tesla. Gamestop is your Tesla. You saw the run up and wondered why you were late? Now it's your chance. Hold it like you would hold Tesla. $GME 10,000  BUY and HOLD
While driving a Tesla.
How about $69,420 and then everyone with one share can buy a Tesla and then Tesla‚Äôs stock will go up.
The most retarded shopping center ever. Just needs a blackberry, PLTR, Nokia, and Tesla charging centers.
If you guys missed out on Tesla. Gamestop is your Tesla. You saw the run up and wondered why you were late? Now it's your chance. Hold it like you would hold Tesla.
Then what about the Tesla squeeze?  Market was just fine (stock was going up after March) when this happened.  Tesla went from peanuts to over 2,500/share then split 5 for 1 and still went up.  All the talking heads blaming GME for the stock market can suck my dick. Guess they forgot about the Rona and the millions out of work and dying by the millions world wide.  Apple has billions in the bank,  crushed earnings and still saw their share price take a dive.  How‚Äôs that for fundamentals you talking heads who say it‚Äôs about fundamentals and not just gambling.  It‚Äôs gambling for the retail investor,  always has been and always will be because the suits that control the market will make sure they get theirs.Edit:  the market is also over bought right now. How the fuck is the DOW so high?  It‚Äôs not because of GME why the market will crash.  It‚Äôs because the market and most stocks have gained unreal gains during a fucking pandemic when most people are broke and out of work.  The market will crash because the rich need someone or something to blame which will be GME. People need to wake up and start the blame at their own government and their inaction to the real issues.
Nope.Yoloed life savings into Tesla....sold Friday of inclusion and bought mutha fuckin GameStonk!Starting buying at 16$. Most recent purchase was at $388
I transferred $2500 from my bank to RH and it's been "in transition" for 4 days. WTF!!!! I need my stonk!!! As soon as this is over I am moving my $$ to Fidelity or Schwab.  I am considering selling some of my Tesla to buy more STONK, but...should I? I'm in a pickle.

(Farily new to this group can't post in main) So, by now it should be obvious to anyone in here that we're standing our ground like the true autistic kids we are. We won't go down until we take what's ours and get what we want.**But, what's next. Is this the new Tesla?**The social media exposure that we're currently getting is crazy and we can use this momentum to our advantage. We have stocks in this company, which directly means we also stand partly responsible for its future. I have faith in a guy such as Ryan Cohen, I think he can take GME to places. We have üíéüëêbut not only because of the stock but also because of our diversity. We are the voice of a whole lot of people so let's use that to discuss what future we want for GME and then lets fucking make that future a reality. Let's all together start making people buy their games at GME. Let's write a letter to Ryan Cohen and get a discussion going. If there is anything to learn from this its that the people's voice matters. So let's take initiative and let Ryan Cohen hear our ideas.Love that people are taking their gains and using it for charity. Real g's all of y'all.
This isn't like VW. With VW there was a surprise. Here, everyone sees everything coming. This is more like Tesla.
Tesla shorting just went up to $47B. Those of you who own shares (I don't) need to HOLD.
There is one huge difference between the GME Squeeze and the VW squeeze:There is no limit on the number of synthetic shares.VW was limited to the number of existing shares.But shortsellers can short GME inifinitely. And money/margin is cheap right now. Borrowing fee doesnt mean shit for naked short selling.Sorry, there will not be a 10k+$ spike. There might be a super long Tesla-style short burn however.
Yup pulled all my money out of Tesla and bought more gme
If Elon tweets out a silver Tesla I‚Äôm YOLOing
Risk management last one for now: there is always another opportunity, don‚Äôt fomo into stuff. I‚Äôve never owned Tesla stock (love Melon). It ran before I got in, and the risk/reward goes down as things run. GameStonk is not your usual trade so this doesn‚Äôt apply there, but typically if something has run like 30% buying options is tough because of the price spike and the reward seldom justifies the cost (unless you specialize in a momentum strategy etc.). There is always another opportunity. Fomo is hard to overcome, and burned me a few times in the beginning, but honestly this has been a huge factor in how I have outperformed consistently.
I‚Äôm going SPY puts next week. I just want enough gains to buy a Tesla so I can finally get a GF.
WHATS THE NEXT TESLA? NOTHING WHATS THE NEXT GME? NOTHING

The company is better off but the existing shareholders just got diluted.  You now own less of the company than you did before.  It's also generally not a good sign that a company needs to raise money this way instead of by making a profit.  Good companies generate excess cash and return it to shareholders by buying shares back (which is the opposite of dilution it means that the existing shareholders now own more of the company) or through dividends.  In the case of AA and AMC it might be seen as less bearish because it's more about weathering the short-term covid storm than a long-term problem with the business (particularly in the case of AA)FWIW Tesla did the same thing.
We won't sell at $10,000I need the money to buy a Tesla model 3 Performance and I only got 5 shares. We need to bring this way beyond the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Musk reasons were personal, Melvin Capital was a well known Tesla short. Musk saw an opportunity to hurt them and him took it!!!
do your own research and make your own decision. just understand that buying on a hype wave is a generally a death sentence for a day trader. Except on Tesla, in this sub, two years ago (fuck me)
Ross and Elon helped us make money when the tesla squeeze happened. You can easily findout who the newbies of WSB are :)
This should literally be pinned. FYI she called Tesla 2 years ago for the noobs.
I m planning to move to UK and retire at UK 2 years later. Tesla stock helps me to achieve this target much earlier than I planned before. We will meet one day.
Tesla counts as stable now?
Once this short squeeze fiasco is over.... I got a feeling people are pouring money into other companies. I‚Äôm thinking Tesla will grab most of the newbies
It's okay if it "breaks the market". When it breaks the market in THIS direction, hedge funds have to liquidate their other holdings to come up with the cash (other holdings like Tesla, Netflix, etc). This means THOSE stocks will start to become affordable for us while they pay off our GME shares. We'll buy them up. We know to buy the dip. It's not a new trend.If a global pandemic couldn't keep the markets down for more than a few weeks, shares in 1 company won't ruin the global markets either.

This. We need to hold to at minimum 20k. 37k ideal. Past that amazing. I want a tesla.
Not a Tesla? Ban
It‚Äôs like finding a small house in your pocket. Or maybe a Tesla roadster haha

I've been buying AMD since 2016 and even bought lots of leaps at $97 sp. I literally felt robbed by Wall Street manipulators after AMD had an amazing ER. Q4 ER- $3.24B up 53% year-over-year- Guidance was 37% YoY which blew Wall St. Estimates out of the water- Demand of CPU and GPU way exceeded supply. (If you are a pc builder or gamer, it is almost impossible to find the new tech in stock at retail.)Major catalysts for 2021- EPYC Milan - current EPYC already shits on Intel's data center processors and new product line will continue destroying them- Ryzen PRO is stealing a lot of corporate laptop shares from Intel. (Thinkpads, gaming, a lot of people are starting to see AMD CPUs as a value gold standard. Cheaper and better performance)- PS5 + Xbox super upgrade cycle - constantly sold out everywhere that runs on AMD gpu and cpu- Tesla rumored to run AMD Navi 23 gpu in their cars- Xilinix partnership to expand market shareSu Bae has been doing AMD justice. There is nothing but good news for the company. YET, Wall St has the AUDACITY to MANIPULATE this shit down after an amazing quarter and guidance. And the Robinhood temporarily restriction on purchasing AMD is the icing on the cake. It just all feels way too coincidental and SUS AF! I will be doubling down on my position tomorrow. Let's squeeze the shit out of these shorts and make em regret for fking with AMD.
Price of a brand new tesla!!!! I'll take two
A year ago I had barely 10k and then Tesla didn't stop _screeching ape squeeze noises_ ü¶ßüíéüëêüöÄüç™and now I'm sitting on 100k lol I need this to happen one more time and I'll quit my job
For anyone who doesn't realize it, they ran this entire playbook against Tesla. For years. They tried to destroy Elon Musk and his company. Elon isn't someone who just rolls over and dies though, and in the end he not only succeeded but made a lot of autists here millionaires last year. This is just the beginning.
Short are already piling up, we just need to drive up momentum and a short squeeze can happen. Shorts will get bigger as price moves up like TESLA! Everyone should go now and upvote this post.

Selling my Tesla shares and buying more GME. THEY THINK THEY CAN SCARE ME? IM LITERALLY RETARDED.  Fuck these guys, feel the wrath of the 99%Not financial advice, my brain is smooth.
Any word on GameStop acquiring Tesla?
Fuckin A,  remember what us tards did to tesla, shorty thought it would top out at 150 pre-split.  Howd that work out for them?
I should‚Äôve, but I thought Apple would be strong with earnings. Selling all my Apple and misc stuff, already have Apple, Tesla, FB, Spy puts loaded. It looks like this is going to be a bumpy road.
Ha. Oil. That‚Äôs so gross. Tesla is a category killer and I am so grateful to see a future without combustible engines. I love them, and I will always be nostalgic for the smells and sounds, but they are poisonous. And so is the hold goddamn industry.
I don't even like Musk but fuck if I make bank off this GME shit hell fucking yea I'll a buy damn tesla and some tesla stock lmao.
Tesla has a Fire Department?  Fuck me, where do I apply?
$BB will climb with or without the hype tbh. Volume has been ridiculously high even before last week. Institutional investors are piling up. Amazon, Baidu, Zoom, Sony, life science conglomerate partnerships, Facebook law suit win (net a few billion$$ imo), patents lineup, etc., they are seriously planting all the seeds with mega corp partnerships. They‚Äôre quietly positioning themselves on a foundation made of damn gold. Not to mention Papa Chen has turned this company around in what 7 years only? Give him a little more time and he will be our next meme lord aka Elon Musk. Say what you want about their marketing and lack of PR tactics, but I respect the company even more as they don‚Äôt care about exposure atm and are focused on laying a foundation to successfully pivot into EV and cyber security. Which they have been doing successfully... Cylance acquisition was also huge. Please do your damn dd. I haven‚Äôt been this confident in a growth stock in awhile. Sure, I‚Äôm biased since I‚Äôve had a position in them for awhile, but your DD will give you conviction as did mine. Also, it is absolutely not ridiculous to compare BB to AMD growth in the short/medium term, or even Tesla. The market potential for them is massive.
Amd partnership with Tesla https://youtu.be/RB58PBTLfxsHelp spread the word help su babe
Don‚Äôt forget Tesla. Where it all started. The catalyst of the propulsion to the moon.
I would commit to buying Tesla over Lambo if Elon gets in on this also I‚Äôll take a box of Gamestonk short shorts üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Tesla was (probably) also reacting to a poor earnings report with a typical drop, which is why it dropped more than Apple Amazon etc. Gross margin for Q4 was a little lower than expected. Nothing that really affects the long term bull thesis, so it'll bounce right back like normal.
Buy a Tesla instead....faster, better, and Papa Elon likes the GME stock. Has lambo peeps said they support us?   No.  Elon has and will help us fly our üöÄ too!
I think I saw something earlier about Tesla making a special gaming pc.. all they have to do is make it available only at game stop.Oh. It's gonna be in the car. https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop
I have 6 Tesla shares that I REALLY have been thinking hard about selling/rolling into GME. My only issue is that they are in RH. I just know that at $320/share it‚Äôs a steal. I have already invested that money (so in my mind I don‚Äôt have it to spend). It‚Äôs more of ehh I could lose 5k but also seeing how much more people on here would lose kinda makes my 5k look small. If I lost it I wouldn‚Äôt be happy but also could continue living my normal life without having to cut corners. I guess I just need to really figure out how to get more shares on RH (definitely only want whatever I had put into TSLA). I‚Äôd definitely go back to TSLA later. Just need the capital now and RH takes forever (on purpose because fuck them) to transfer money from my bank account.
4D chess by papa musk. Temporarily sacrifice Tesla price to get the WSB retards to liquidate in favour of GME. GME reaches Pluto, autists get tendies.  Then what?  They all re-buy *more* Tesla stock with those tendies like good little retards, because it‚Äôs now ‚Äúso low‚Äù, bringing Tesla higher than ever. Brilliant play, I must say.
You know who was right about Tesla? Every single retail investor. You know who was wrong about Tesla? Every single hedge fund. TO THE MOON üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
This does not compare to Tesla at all. This is far beyond being ‚Äúheavily shorted.‚ÄùHOLD.
He does of tesla.
I would make this a post but I haven‚Äôt made it past the auto mods for weeks.I believe GME‚Äôs rise will look more like the Tesla squeeze than the VW squeeze. Here are some quotes about the Tesla squeeze:‚ÄúSome entity ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know who ‚Äî was executing a strategy of buying massive quantities of out-of-the-money call options,‚Äù forcing call-option sellers to buy enough stock to hedge their exposure, Spiegel, founder of hedge fund firm Stanphyl Capital Partners, suggested by phone. ‚ÄúThis thing just kind of spiraled its way up.‚ÄùWhat highly-regarded individuals do we know that would buy way OTM calls? üßê‚ÄúAnother driver has been widespread enthusiasm among individual investors buying Tesla shares this year through trading apps like Robinhood, according to Spiegel. ‚ÄúThere was this whole gambling mentality that took place,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúpartially because people got stuck at home‚Äù during the pandemic with stimulus checks to spend.‚ÄùGME has the same ingredients as the Tesla squeeze, only instead of sprinkling those ingredients in, someone poured the whole damn bottle out. I say all this so that people can look into how the shorts unwound on Tesla. This may not be a one day event.Also, to newcomers: we didn‚Äôt buy into GME to fuck over hedge funds. That‚Äôs icing on the cake. Please go research Ryan Cohen and read his letter to the board. Papa Cohen‚Äôs involvement is what makes GME‚Äôs outlook brighter than the other meme stocks people are peddling. Smashing hedge funds is icing on the cake, but believe me, what we want is the cake.*Warning: I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, my financial advisor is a Mr. Planter‚Äôs ü•ú. Don‚Äôt take this as financial advise. I‚Äôm artistic.*
Pls everyone text Elon Musk to announce a cooperation between Tesla and Gamestock! If he would do that the stock would go to the moon.
Mmm, go for your life if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it. The financial outcomes history of those shorting TSLA has been quite bad (I think it was now $40bn they'd lost on short bets).That however isn't what I said, blue chip and major tech shares will see a sell off by those who need to raise finance. Given the Friday price drop for Tesla I'd say the primary sell off has already been done there, at worst there may be another round Monday. Other shares (and when I said tech I was more thinking Alphabet/Farcebook etc than ea games) may or may not have had a sell off (I can only tell you about the things I'm watching...)But what would I know ? I don't have a crystal ball, it's just what I'd do if I was them...

Hey guys, this is my two-cents:Hey retards and autists - *first of all my position is currently $GME 300 shares @ 315. Im not a financial advisor - more like a financial retard. Also, I am Norwegian and therefore please excuse my grammar. I'm doing my best.* # 1. We, the MARKET decides the priceSimply put - the Hedgies believe that GME is ready for chapter 11. That's why the amount of short position came to be that high as we see now. But at the same time, there is plenty of us that believe the contrary. We believe that the company has a fantastic future. GME is valued at 22B as of today. Now is that fair price? Who gives a shit. **WE LIKE THE STOCK**. Im going on a limb now and say that NONE of us are investing in stocks like Warren Buffet - like holding stocks until you die. Therefore, we buy stocks high and we sell high. Meaning the stock price doesn't fucking matter.Therefore RH and SEC and all the other complete retards out there, has nothing to say and should not manipulate a company's market capital. Look at Tesla they have path the way to value similar EV companies to a 25-100 P/S ratio. You didn't see this only 2 years ago.This is why I see that the stock price of GME as of now is not overvalued - and it is not a bubble. # 2. Everyone that is in the stock market, is following GME closely - many are invested - and many new will come We are upset. We are angry. AND we are **Bullish!**  Because of all the media coverage and the narrative this thing has become, we are actually not seeing investors flooding in because of FOMO, but because they don't want the other party to win. For every little fuck-up, hiccup and manipulation the MMs and brokers and the media pull on us, it will just build more momentum for "the little guys". This is a free market and the GME shareholders beat the HFs in their own game - and we are not FUCKING SELLING.# 3. Can you imagine if this was the other way around?Let's say, theoritcally, that the HFs looked at GME and saw that 140% of the stock was shorted and they used their small monkey brains to say "hey, I think this will blow up, if the share price increases. We should buy this thing" And the retail investor was the one who had shorted this stock into oblivion. Do you think MELVIN FUCKING CAPITAL would cry to the public and say WE NEED REGULATION TO PROTECT RETAIL INVESTORS?Fuck no, they would exploit the shiet out this situation and make us retail investors bleed to death. This makes the case of the outrage we see from the investors - because we know they only care about money. The good thing is that GME investors has been dealt the best hand at this poker table and WE RETARDS LIKE BOTH MONEY AND THE STONK. # 4. There is no way in hell the government will fuck the retail investor in the brownholeThis has become a political issue now and for the first time EVER both sides of the party agrees on one thing. WALL STREET SHOULD TAKE THEIR OWN FUCKING MEDICINE. Can you imagine the government will allow wall street to fuck over avarage joe again all around the world? NO. They are sick of wall street, and it is now the popular opinion to side with WSB and not Wall Street themselves. FUCK YOU. # 5. The retarded maths are pretty clear this stonk is on the way to PlutoThe past 10 days we have read from numerous retards that this is infact a squeeze that is bound to happen. You think 350 bucks is the ceiling? FUCK YOU BITCH, it's not. When the liquidty of the float drops, and all these shorts need to cover the stock will catch on a new upward momentum - however, at some point unfortunately it will literally go tits up, but by then the Hedgies have lost so much money, and we have won and GME is a reformed company. &amp#x200Btldr - JUST FUCKING HOLD, BE PART OF HISTORY AND WATCH THIS STONK GO TO 4200.69

Ask your neighbour's dog. He put me onto Tesla. Goodest boy.
Just sold all my Tesla to fund GME they need it and I like the stock a lot!!!!
cars will appreciate in value for the first time ever, sadly, fuel will be through the roof as well.Electric cars on the other hand, damn. Tesla Cybertruck might be the perfect apocalypse car with solar panels generating up to 60 miles of range a day, imagine driving that thing somewhere in the US with lots of sun.Also, the doors are literally bulletproof against 9mm ammo and comes with cabin filters rated against biological weapons. All this while driving nearly silent.Elon out to make some dope ass apocalypse cars.
Pick any blue chip / tech stock, and they'll be being sold to finance this.Hell Tesla is down to $788 as of friday from $830-850 - I'll bet that was deliberate because Papa Musk tweeted support for "Gamestonks !"
You better get a Tesla so you can hold the diamonds with your hands while the autopilot drives you to the moon üëêüíé
I missed out on the ___ event ( can't type certain words or the botnwill remove) but it's a certain currency. I barely made anything from tesla, and I missed on this event and have only 1 share. So I'm going to do options trading starting tomorrow. Regardless of whether I know something or not. I'm legit just tired of missing these things, I need the money, so it's do or die.
Sameeee. If there's one company I trust to never stop innovating, it's Tesla.
In terms of the meme stock fad, I get it people have had a strange year, to say the least. People like feeling included, besides this crew...Wednesday‚Äôs swings were interesting to see, for all those who had no idea how Tesla moved for similar nonsense last yearIt‚Äôs given people something to care about for 1 or 2 weeks, and I think that‚Äôs alright. Just give them time to loose everything/read about prostis and nose beers/even try to figure out what a covered call is, and it will endThis place is not that interesting to hang out in the wee weekend hours. It will return back to normal soon
Honestly, when we get our tendies, I think I'll drive a Tesla for the rest of my life.
I love the planet so I would buy a tesla regardless
DIAMANTEN TESLA
&gtYeah man...the fact that we got $600 out of 900 billion almost screams the fact that they are going to do everything they can to prevent this from happening again. Big money won't let this down.Stuff like this happens all the time. Not this exact situation by massive volatile unpredictable moves happen once a year or more. Tesla has exploded in value recently. Also at the beginning of the pandemic oil went negative, that was also a massive unpredictable event. (Also cause by shorts manipulating the commodity)
I'm literally putting all my money in TSLA and Tesla products. And some land and goats.
If Papa Musk helps us out and it gets to 5000 I vow to buy Tesla vehicle (cheapest One tho, got people I want to help out)
Bro this is some cryptonic Elon musk language. All ELON should know is I‚Äôm buying a Tesla for all my family if the stonks go brrrrüöÄüöÄ
To be fair, Elon‚Äôs original Gamestonk! tweet was a huge catalyst for recognition of this situation by mainstream media and the Twittersphere.He did enough to gain brownie points for Tesla in my book.
Same. Tesla and Flamethrower for all my friends and family.
Was looking at the Tesla homepage yesterday, he should definitely make a new series: Model GME
I would 100% buy a Tesla if I could swing one from this
BlackBerry is the only stock which isn't a meme and actually has a promising future. It was just listed as one of the most likely stocks to surge 1,000% and the cybersecurity market is huge. Imagine BlackBerry securing partnerships with Tesla, Alphabet, etc. I don't know why everyone is sleeping on this stock
At the AMC super dome! Established in 2022 when our financial freedom fighters at wallstreetbets saved the dying business. With the help of President musk, specially elected in 2024, and tesla galactic amc was able to open the first movie theater on mars!I might be too drunk
I‚Äôm starting to think this stock is going to just turn into the next Tesla stock just a constant short battle and people buying for no reason, BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE STOCK!! why sell when the possibilities are endless??
More like Tesla ish run. Sure we will have some explosive fires, but I see it rubbing like TSLA over a year
This is correct. They reloaded at 3-400, which seems like a safe bet but here‚Äôs the thing.Somehow, this has become a passion play.You know the last shorted passion play? Fucking Tesla. Now, I hate Tesla lol. I won‚Äôt lie. That said, they squeezed it for months and months while it crawled up and here‚Äôs the other thing about GME...In June, I expect Ryan Cohen to become CEO.These shares might ACTUALLY be worth 400 in this market. Tech gets speculative bubbles, brick and mortar doesn‚Äôt. If GME shifts gears, it gets the tech treatment. I was wildly excited in January as GME was going to present at a conference and they shifted their category from ‚Äúretail‚Äù to ‚Äútech‚ÄùThey dropped out of that conference and announced Ryan Cohen as new board member.Somethings brewing and these motherfuckers just bought off tons of debt so they got legs, man.
$36...maybe...next year or longer. $145? Nope. $811 billion dollar market cap at $145. When did NOK become the next Tesla?
By SEC definition it‚Äôs not market manipulation unless he has the intent to defraud someone with untruthsHave you ever seen tv?? Analysts. Big names. All kinds of people go on air and say I have this position in X and I think it‚Äôll go up 5x in the next 3 years. People then buy that stock up. Example Cathie Wood, Ron Barron, with Tesla. being a famous person and buying a stock cuz you want to and say that you have that stockIS NOT MANIPULATION
It‚Äôs gonna hit $1,000. It‚Äôs gonna hit $1,000. It‚Äôs gonna hit $1,000.TESLA IS GONNA HIT $1,000. What did you retards think I was talking about?
Fuck I hope so!!  That would be life changing.  I'd finally be able to afford a tesla model s for $69,420
That‚Äôs some bullshit. All stocks started out as penny stocks. Hell some ppl have become millionaires, because of stocks. Tesla is one for them. Why is it that some ppl don‚Äôt want other ppl to be rich and enjoy it also?
Don‚Äôt sell Tesla he is our man too.
I would buy a Tesla, and with all the leftovers invest it in Tesla
how do you not mention tesla battery day
I bought Tesla stock with all $1800 of my savings the first week of March. My husband was about as disappointed in my stock "gambling" as I expected him to be, especially after it went down even further over the next three weeks. My diamond hands are still holding most of it, although I sold some for gme. We're both autists now.
Pretty much everyone would buy a Tesla.
We're at Tesla level of shorts this week. Its about timeüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Remember when shorts went after Elon Musk at Tesla?  Namaste Technologies Chairman of the Board is Brandon Spikes With twenty years experience working as CIO for Elon Musk at Zip2, PayPal, Tesla, and SpaceX where he helped pioneer, architect, and build some extraordinary technology, Branden brings experience, perspective, and a unique skill set to his endeavors.
Yep I‚Äôm a retard here . 1k in NOK waiting on the Calvary. But SLV? fuck that i would rather short call Tesla. Keep hear about d0ge which i thinks is a distraction along with SLV. Stick With GME first if you got some spare dough then I would put some in these AMC BB NOK. Then again what the fuck do I know I‚Äôm just some basement dwelling retard who likes video games and stonks.
let's squeeze this girl to $1000 like tesla and make mama su even richer.   PayüëèBacküëèTimeüëè  SQUEEZE THE SHORTS
Guess I am a member of that club.  Had Tesla in my kids education fund and sold them about 2 years ago.  Doubled my money on those shares but man I missed out on a monster run in it this year.  Hopefully I don't make that mistake again...
Hey boys are we ready for Monday to send all these babies to the moon amc/GME/BB770@25 let's push babIES up at least$300 or equal to Tesla price !!!!I'm retarded!! RMSL
My man u will get ur tesla believe and it shall manifest
"SO LATE IN THE GAME" - and other lies you tell yourselves: A personal historyIt's too late baby now it's too late. WRONG! You know what the bank teller told me when I was doing a cash deposit to buy shillcroin at \~$500? 'Oh shillcroin don't you think it's too late to get in on that? And then numerous coworkers spouting how they 'knew about' shillcroin at $1..$5..$5000 etc. and they should have invested. Noting that they said this at EVERY price point and NEVER bought. After months of suggesting to a friend he should purchase e-ther-shallnotbenamed he finally pulled the trigger at about $300 - idiot only bought 2 (much less than he could afford to lose) - if he did some proper YOLO he'd have his apartment paid off and maybe would have grown the balls to leave his dumb fuck wife (and his bf lol) before they had a kid - that guys life is literally ruined. This has nothing to do with crippletoecurrency it is a mindset.&amp#x200BTake Tesla. I bought in around 2014. Having my smashed avo on toast one morning in 2018 (I can afford that because I never say it's too fucking late) I overhear this douche talking about how he's shorting Tesla oh yeah it's so easy look at the fundamentals - Tesla was obv. down at this point in time. That guys probably turning tricks just to lick an avocado seed now.&amp#x200BIn years to come it won't matter how much you made or lost on the great Gamestop ride - it will be DID YOU. RIDE. IT?! &amp#x200BIt's not too late - and if you think it is - NEVER talk about gamestop when this is all over - you don't get to. You don't deserve the topic of conservation. You're either part of this - or you're not.
Among the S&ampP Composite 1500, GameStop is the most heavily shorted stock as a percentage of shares available for sale, according to FactSet, which updates the numbers twice a month. The most heavily shorted stock in dollars is Tesla Inc. ($TSLA). Let's not forget about who is taking us to the moon!
It‚Äôs a tax write off, you expect a share of Tesla for your first $100 deposit? Pass what ever your smokin‚Äô cause GME is at $4,200.69
That's what I fear. I'm a fervent believer, I've in for a true YOLO, I moved every penny except for my Tesla stocks into GME and I'll die in the trenches before I sell, but deep down I think the hedgies have enough dirty tricks and capital to do whatever the fuck they want. If the squeeze starts squeezing, Robinhood is going to crash, the SEC will halt trading, or something else will happen that we have no control over that I can't even conceive.
My fucking man, BB IS THE ULTIMATE SECURITY E/V  PLAY... AMAZON, BAIDU, WHO TF DOES TESLA GET THEIR MAPS IN CHINA FROM? BAIDU U FUCKS, BB TO THE FUCKING üåôüåôüåôüåôüåô
This is the Way.There's more than one Way to take their toys away from them.  GME and AMC are the first steps.  But when they start selling their Amazon and Tesla shares to cover, that's when some of us sweep in and bag them at a discount.No prisoners.
Bro. If this hits 50k you could totally buy a tesla. Just hold
I am thinking of doing the same thing. I got $20k in tesla. Might turn it all into GME

**Why I think that a short squeeze of silver is important for our democracy and can actually work.** **1. Why do banks manipulate the precious metals market?** Since Nixon and the end of Bretton Woods, currencies are no longer bound to precious metals such as gold and silver. They are actually just printed paper, the equivalent of which is our trust. As a result of this system, banks have a monopoly on creating money. However, the current monetary system has come to an end. The banks also know this and they absolutely want control over the coming monetary system, which will again be covered by precious metals. That is why they manipulate prices downwards through "paper gold" and "paper silver", while at the same time stocking up. In the case of gold, it is assumed that there is 80 times as much "paper gold" as physical gold on the market. I think it could be the same with silver. You are probably familiar with the activities of JPMorgen. What you may not yet know is that precious metals will become real money again through the back door. In Europe, this is now made possible by a new legislative package called "Basel 3". This allows banks, among other things, to keep their equity in gold, silver and platinum from 01/01/2022. This will make real money again, but only for the banks and not for ordinary people. The amount of paper money currently being printed makes inflation at least likely. Should there be a currency reform after inflation, the new currency will certainly be backed by precious metals. Black Rock or JPMorgen are the big winners because they have been soaked with precious metals for years. Ordinary people are left with a worthless exchange rate. This plunges them into a financial dependency on who has control over the money. Again the banks. So it is very important for everyone who wants to be free tomorrow to make themselves as independent as possible from the power of the banks. Buying precious metals is a great option. **2. Why not only gold but also silver and platinum?** Electrical engineering is also becoming increasingly important because of climate change. Both metals are very important industrial metals, especially for electrical engineering. At the same time, they are very rare. Or rather, they are much less physically available than gold. The actual silver available is 10 times less than gold. This is because more than 60% of silver production is consumed by industry, while gold is almost entirely preserved. The gold-silver ratio in nature is 1 to 15 and only 290 tons of platinum are mined worldwide each year. Isn't that strange? Very important, very rare and at the same time very cheap compared to the manufacturing costs? Why actually? Of course it is being manipulated. But why on an even larger scale than gold? In fact, silver is much more important than gold because our economy is much more dependent on silver than gold. Control over these vital metals means control over the economy. I don't know what you think about it, but I think it is dangerous if JPMorgen can decide whether Tesla can buy enough silver or platinum. **3. Can a SHORT SQUEEZE Silver work at all?** The fact is, it's a much bigger thing than GameStop stock. A short squeeze is more like a marathon than a sprint. On the other hand, there are very weighty reasons that speak for it. The silver market is much smaller than the gold market, and an ounce of silver is affordable to many more people than an ounce of silver. At the same time, the importance of silver for industry is a very good lever. If silver suddenly goes up significantly, it is possible that the industry will buy in bulk and take in the storage costs. What happens if Tesla comes up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãentering the silver market with $10billion tomorrow in order to secure cheap prices quickly? Or Appel? Or Google? In any case, they have the money. I could imagine that JPMorgen and Blackrock also falter when they have sold "paper silver" and then suddenly have to physically deliver it to the industry. And that is 80 times more silver than is physically present. Oh yeah, I think they'd be really f..ked:-)But even if the short squeeze does not succeed, the invested money is not gone. Of course there were always fluctuations in the price, but precious metals have proven to be very stable in value over the past 6000 years. I believe silver will definitely increase in value. If there is inflation or a crash, silver becomes a means of payment. If there is a boom, it is consumed in industry. No matter what, I think the price will go up anyway .The only thing that can't happen is for Wall Street criminals to take control of it.
Yeah I‚Äôm hoping some of this hype transfers over to BB, as before it was popular but got kinda over taken by GME understandably. I‚Äôm heavily invested in BB and can see it taking off as they will play a huge role in the future of EV companies and security in most companies. Also heard talks about them partnering with Tesla but god knows if that‚Äôll ever happen
Dude I dont like it either but im going to take the W here. Posing as a leftist movement will get the media and Washington behind us, it will also keep Reddit admins on our side too. Plus these guys are dropping money down to prop up GME for us. As long as I walk out with a Tesla, Lambo, and paid off house in the end I'm Gucci.
Tesla margin requirement was 70% the day im referencing for highest volume, 2nd im merely referencing Tesla for number of dollars exchanged in a day comparison to GME as an indicator of the type of liquid brokers can move in a day.
Looked like someone had to sell a LOT of Tesla on Friday as well... üò¢üòÇ
Elon Musk's offer would always be "how about I take over as founder and CEO of your company in exchange for a tesla roadster".
tesla should just aquire gme or merge lmfao
So that‚Äôs why my Tesla tanked.... Welp time to do the same Monday üíéüíéüöÄüöÄ
Selling my tesla positions monday. 90k injection into gme baby. I already have 100k in and I'll add the 90. Fuck wall st and their market manipulation.
He's gotta know that if WSB makes bank, the profits are getting thrown back into Tesla right?
i think wsb is just turning GME into a money printer at this point. people that need to sell will sell, and others will take their place by buying the dip. shorts will never be able to cover and the price just marches on to infinite, just like tesla.
Selling my 389 Nio shares and 50 Tesla to save my beloved AMD. Going all out on my first stonk love since 2016. I like the stonk!
Then we create the second longest squeeze in history after Tesla, and GME will eventually morph with Tesla and have babies playing videogames on Mars. I have spoken.
A whale ending this for us sounds the best case, Elon could do really fucking well in publicity out of this thing too. I currently own just 10 shares so I know I won't be able to buy a Tesla at the end of this but I'll keep investing the profit until I can.
There is nothing that gives me more thrill and joy than playing Tesla 0DTEs every friday
Hi from CanadaI have 100 BB stocks too, hold and be patient, forget the dips and forget the prices you see all a manipulationThe stock will hit $700 soon then off to the moon $10k and beyondThey are shorting it in hopes of driving it bankrupt so that Amazon can build their stupid ai algorithms for self driving cars.BB GO research it you‚Äôll see they provide OS for ev infotainment and self driving software development all tied with Magna international and LG electronics and that‚Äôs right with Tesla This is not financial information and Fuck you SEC if you see this HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLDüöÄüíé‚úäüíé‚úäüíé‚úäüíé‚úäüíé‚úäüíéüöÄ
Those 50 billion didn‚Äôt come from gme... they mostly come from Tesla Plug and another before GME... do some research...
Why papa Elon not getting more involved? He has so much personal beef with citadel. They near caused Tesla to fail a few years back by shorting
Something I've considered doing, although legally I can't advise anyone else about what they should do, is to sell a small quantity of shares to cover my purchase costs, and then to hold the rest indefinitely "for free." That way I won't miss out entirely on a big run-up, and all of the stress is removed.For example, I have 10 shares of Tesla at $28 each, which are up a few thousand percent. I'm considering selling one, and may or may not do so.I find that my diamond hands are wrapped in paper, and that once I've shucked off that sunk cost outer layer, I never feel the need to sell again.
Point is, if they closed GME down with volume approaching 30 billion when Tesla cost them 100 billion in a day in the past they were expecting GME to cost them SIGNIFICANTLY more than that same 100 Billion Tesla had cost them once before.
 TL:DR **The value of every single share sold on GME highest trading day is 1/5 the value of what Tesla traded at on its highest volume day so to have a liquid issue over trading that was costing 1/5 that of stocks traded in the past is a blatant lie.**
You misspelt GME. Why post about another stock on a GME post? Of course everyone should do their own brain thing but I sense the dark side of hedge funds amongst the subreddit. Not that the interns working for ü•ú at these places aren't welcome outside of emperor palpatins working hours but personally I'm ignoring all posts currently talking about:1. Omg this stonk here nxt big sqouzely pop2. Omg look at these shiny car I won by selling GameStop made me. 3. Omg no more short4. Pretty much anything that opposes the DD put into gme by wsb previously unless there is a damning amount of DD put into that post. I mean a heap of DD. A heap of reputable, reliable DD which I'm pretty sure doesn't exist.I'm in. I bought the dip. I bought the peak. I will buy on Monday. I will hold. I had an exit plan, I was going to gradually sell up to $1000. No more. The shit they pulled last week means I am now holding till I see them crash and burn. Hell I made all this on Tesla, using it to set fire to a hedge fund seems a damned good use of this cash.This is my plan, not financial advice.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüíéüíéüëê
Just remember for this. Tesla shorts lost more than the entire airline industry last year. Did they ever cover their shorts? Yeah, they covered their old ones, but they doubled and tripled down with new shorts. Why are people telling you GME shorts are different from TSLA shorts? They have no fucking clue
Put VR in each gamestop. Use VR as virtual TESLA showroom. Boom ... CROSSOVER !
Musk won't forgive how they attempted to tank tesla in 2008-2009, how many sticks they put into his wheels. He will support wsb ü§ò
Not really, Tesla was fucked over by shorters last year so it's more of a grudge kinda thing.
I worked for GE motors and controls.  They had built a van with an electric motor that ran on natural gas.  Honestly they didn't have the capital or drive to do what Tesla has done.The whole plant was eventually closed and moved to Mexico to build electric motors.
Buy a Tesla
Lol I‚Äôm a broke ass bitch. I sold 40 shares of Tesla in June 2019 to for the down payment on my house. I still kick myself every day. If I would have held I‚Äôd be buying 5000 shares of BB. Not missing the rocket ship this time. üíéüôå
Yeah, made a fake account called WSBGod and claimed millions in tesla gains that ended up being photoshopped. There was some other stuff too, he was trying to profit off the sub. Wrote a book about it too.
I pledge to buy a Tesla with my GME tendies üöÄ
1000% agree, Tesla over Lambo... WsB will turn into the biggest tesla fanboys. Let's do this Musky.
The year is 2030. The unemployment rate is 99%. There are only two companies left in America, Tesla and GameStop. You have two choices for employment: becoming a WallStreetBets ‚Äútrader‚Äù or posting on OnlyFans. Life is good.
You just wait, when he *does* go to fucking Mars people be like,"EMpEror eLOm mAkeS a GReaT ovERLOrd cUZ he'S a GOOD BUsINEssMaN!!!!!"Please, retards.  I like Tesla too, and I watch a lot of SpaceX launches, but let Elon do Elon shit. Don't make him president of Mars or anything else.
There is nothing inherently wrong with shorting a stock. You make a bet that the company will be worth less. Sometimes you‚Äôre right (Luckin, Nikola) sometimes you‚Äôre wrong (Tesla, Herbalife, GME). What‚Äôs wrong is a system that lets people short more than the existence of shares and double down to try to bankrupt a company.
I bought tesla 4 years ago around $200 and everyone was saying it was overvalued and that I should have bought when it was around $45. I bought it anyways and I still haven't sold.
If I reach 600k next week I‚Äôm buying myself and my family a Tesla
Next week 600k HOLD STILLüëêüíé. ORDER YOUR TESLA THERE WILL BE A SHORTAGEüöÄüî•üî•
BUY BUY BUY AND HOLD UNTIL YOU CAN BUY EVERYONE IN YOUR FAMILY A FUCKING LAKEHOUSE AND TESLA EACH!!! üíéüöÄüíéüöÄüíéüöÄüíé
If it hits 20k and I sell I'll get a tesla starship with GME on the side
So this has potential to be a year long squeeze if they keep shorting, similar to Tesla?
My mom Alreadycoming for me saying focus on school she also told me to sell Tesla
Dr. Michael Burry being one themI know fuck him for shorting Tesla but at the same time guy knows his shit
And when Elon colonizes Mars the first two businesses up there better be a Tesla Dealership and a GameStop.
went from picking out the color of my tesla to being margin called
Damn I‚Äôm gonna have to sell my Tesla shares in that case
/u/PidgeonLover Could be Bert. Could be Nikola Tesla. The world may never know.
My stupid bother in law is telling me I‚Äôve made a huge mistake because GME shares aren‚Äôt worth shit cause the company is useless (unlike Tesla or Volkswagen) and there will be no squeeze and I‚Äôm about to loose all my money. Since I‚Äôm retarded and tired and don‚Äôt know shit about stocks (first time buying, here to play along but dumb AF) he‚Äôs ruined my day.Someone tell me different please!Holding nonetheless, I don‚Äôt care üöÄüíé
YOU KNOW WHAT, I AM RETARD. ENJOY ME.$GME TESLA MODEL S
I realy don't know, i wonder why Elon didn't fucked them. Melvin was bragging that he was making money in 2016-2017 when Tesla wasn't as loved as today. If elon buys 200-300M worth of options i think he will gama squeeze the fuck out of them.
One of the big problems with most of the short positions now is their long term success relies on an increasingly large amount of people willing to YOLO because the companies don‚Äôt have a good a game plan. But look at what happened to Tesla. Massive short interest for a long time but they also had a growth story. It became a lightning Rod for shorts similar to gme or amc but it kept going because the story could keep people in long term ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èBCRX actually has a great drug pipeline and the short interest is high pre squeeze. The only reason GME has such a high dollar value on their short interest is because they have already squeezed shorts who instead of covering decided to double down. What is long term plan for game stop? I dunno, but they‚Äôd have to reinvent themselves as a company to stay relevant and I hope they do. BCRX doesn‚Äôt have to reinvent itself, just execute. Anyway, that‚Äôs my two sense, you do you, this is not investment advice but just how I see things currently. I hope GME and amc work out, AMC already managed to convert their debt into stocks so frankly this whole thing probably saved AMC already
I guess it depends on how you define "undervalued." I'm not yet convinced that NKLA will ever actually produce a vehicle and never fully understood why we needed a new Tesla (I mean really, talk about posing, he called the company Nikola (the famed inventor Nikola Tesla) and was a snake oil salesman posing as Elon Musk.  Sorry, I gave my opinion more strongly than I usually do. I didn't like seeing everyone get burned when the scam was exposed. BCRX has a 1.5 billion market cap. If you do a quick math of the pipeline, you will find that does not reflect the value of the drugs in the pipeline. SP has to gap up for the company to reach fair value.  There is such high institutional ownership that retail represents a small percentage of the float. The Autists arguing for a short squeeze (and I'm not one of them) are saying that if retail simply buys the available shares when the institutions run their shorting algorithm and take those shares, the price has to gap up. It can perform like a low float stock.
The screen should be part of the Tesla windshield and you pay for the charge by watching commercials. If you keep clicking to show you are really paying attention to the commercials then you get to keep charging. This is a much more likely scenario.
BB has long term potential its not only a meme stock. Its partnered with Amazon, Bidu and looking potentially at Tesla. I like the stock
People are like, GME's stock price is crazy! And it's like, 25 billion market cap on 6 billion revenue isn't crazy. 800 billion market cap on 25 billion in revenue is crazy.I had three thousand ready to go into Tesla stock in June of 2019 and I had to pay for an emergency operation for my cat instead. That 3k would be over 60k now, but I would have paperhanded it a dozen times in the meantime so I can't kick myself that hard.
In the middle of this feel like if they said anything the would be going to jail. Remember the shit storm Musk made with just a meme tweet about Tesla price at $420
A Casio's and a Tesla, got it. üöÄ
&gt	who either drive a Tesla after 2 months or lost their house in 3 months.Why not both? The back seat of my Tesla sleeps just fine so I said screw the house - reverse mortgage to BUY MORE GME!
Thinking of selling one tesla share (sorry daddy Elon) and buying a few more gme, thoughts?
Stock market grows 7% yearly on average. Index funds buy stocks that match the stock market. Hence, you make 7% per year on average.Bit of a weird concept for all of us on WallStreetBets, who either drive a Tesla after 2 months or lost their house in 3 months.
I bought in before the split - interestingly enough the shares are now worth the same as they were when the split happened.    If Tesla splits the stocks again, absolutely worth it to buy in at the lower cost
Let‚Äôs be real, there is absolutely no way Tesla is worth 800 billion dollars lmaoI just hope it keeps going üöÄüöÄüöÄ
**They say once you go blackberry, you never go back.**Blackberry was at 28$ USD on Wednesday before Robinhood and the other brokers decided to fuck us over and ban trading of the stock.

Since tesla cars can play games like cyberpunk 2077 gamestop can sell games through tesla similar to how steam works and tesla owners can play games while the car autodrives them to their destinations.
I see this ending in just a few ways.1. We all panic sell, and crash the stock. Really? After working in concert for weeks? 2. We withdraw slowly each selling a few shares at a time. People with 1 share will get out at the top. People with thousands will sell some shares at the top.Eventually only big share holders are left, and have sold a percentage at a profit, and small investors are out safely. 3. The Gamestop CEO uses this opportunity to remake the company into the next Amazon or Tesla, and we are in at the ground floor of a new era.I'm hoping for 3. We just gave him a second chance, i hope he takes it.A vitual city (mud) that the entry price is owning a share of GME?The Gamestop retail stores could have VR centers with live avatar purchases. Purchasing upgrades, plus a share of GME would be self sustaining, and profitable.
That letter doesn't provide the full story. The owner of the account 'deposited' $5k into the account and proceeded to trade with instant deposits. Know that instant deposits is margin that RH provides the account owner while their funds settle. The owner proceeds to buy Tesla with margin and makes $18k. So far so good... Until her funds never settled and instead bounced. So she never had any of her money in the account in the first place. So any gains that were made with RH money, isn't technically hers.RH initially asked for a $7k deposit to cover which is $5k initial deposit + an additional $2k, but then raised it to $20k which is $18k + $2k. I'm guessing RH is saying if she wants her gains, she's going to have to cover RH for both the money they gave her on margin plus the gains that were made on margin.Is RH right or wrong... Debatable. But she is definitely in the wrong for trading on funds that ultimately bounced.
GME might dilute with more shares and people will be able to get in cheaper.They have a $100 million dollar share offering in their back pocket -  at closing price, that's less than half a million shares.They could use that to cancel debt, and it would create bullish sentiment, or at the very least, get people to stfu about "but mah fundahmentahls".Those new shares would mean cheaper shares for interested buyers, or might be enough of an incentive for a short to finally unwind their position. Either way, price goes back up almost immediately. It's win win win, unless you're a short. Then you lose.There is enough demand to eat the liquidity up and still have an appetite for moreThen reverse split.   Example. Tesla and apple this past yearNot financial advice I‚Äôm just a idiot on his moms phone
They‚Äôre pretty much the only company that didn‚Äôt require a bailout 10 years ago.https://www.barrons.com/articles/BL-FUNDSB-2847?tesla=yThey didn‚Äôt fire anyone either (although they did let go of some contracted employees once their contract was over). Even Blackrock and Fidelity can‚Äôt claim this.True, they do not have the cheapest fees on index funds, and their app has an ass UI. But they‚Äôre a really good boomer place to store your index funds and watch the 7% yearly returns, in case you‚Äôve decided the heart attacks from watching $GME all this week was too much.*Am not a financial employee. But I am a Vanguard employee so I‚Äôm heavily biased.
Tesla?? That aint og motha fucka were you here with us for the mattress company that almsot bankrupt this sub
This guy who made 1 million from 500 dollars worth of calls on Tesla
Might as well make a drive in theater with tesla charging stations while we're at it.
The dude who sold TSLA at $750 spike and posted himself in his new Tesla auto driving him home with some Fresh Chicken Tendies. He inspires me
Selling all my Tesla shares (up 350%) Monday to buy more GME. YOLO!
AMC to Mars then we can hang out with Elon and buy Tesla !!!
I've had a pretty crazy year, from down 8k to up 350k. Tesla, zoom, gme was 95% of my gains.
He said TESLA was a "Cult Stock".  Then said he was wrong...He's been wrong all along.
We don‚Äôt need to do anything. Within two years Tesla will have tripled, again
I was in here when it had maybe 600,000 to 800,000 people. Reddit actually recommended it to me so I clicked on WSB, To lurk around and found a fucking shit show people calling each other Autist,retards, brain dead investors, etc that‚Äôs when I knew I had found my long lost people. Watched u/WSBgod with his Tesla calls and then came time to buy SPCE and now we‚Äôre here again with even more autist
Exactly what I‚Äôm banking on. Everyone with FOMO is going to go with AMC because it‚Äôs cheap. The working man can grab 7 shares for under $100 right now. That 7 shares at $100 is a good return for them. I‚Äôm holding 300 shares until I have enough to buy a Tesla for my wife. I may try to grab some more at the dip Monday morning if it happens.
Elon doesn‚Äôt like shorters because there‚Äôs a good chance Tesla pops in the near future
Same, thinking of Tesla as a car company is thinking too small. Tesla is a new energy company that has a go to market product that‚Äôs a car (along with the energy capture and storage systems to support it).
He is predicting 700 in the first 30 min of trading on monday lol. Next stop 4200.69, then- 1 Tesla per share.
I would love to see Wall Street try to short Tesla again, that‚Äôll be some fire works, Tesla to Youranus for sure
Cuz the price is dumb. Tesla is great but about any of the other manufacturers have better financials.
Jokes aside, with Biden being all about the green, Tesla is a good investment. It's gonna be a good future for Papa Musk.
Should we be buying and holding Tesla after this as a thank you to Elon for the support?
Tesla stock rapidly crashing as WSB shifts focus to GME
Well in terms of the company value, jpmorgans is right, tesla doesn't produce much and their market cap is 20 time higher than their total assets, it's high only because people like the stock.
Gamestop moves most sales online maintaining limited store presence, with brick and mortar stores retrofitted to have viewing rooms for live local gaming competitions / eSports viewingTesla charging stations installed outside of every single Gamestop to charge while you cheer. Pay to charge up and get a small Gamestop online credit to your account.AMC snackbars with popcorn and theater sodas in every Gamestop for your snacking-while-streaming needs and AMC is responsible for the projection hardware leased to Gamestop.Which meme stock company says no? Put this in play when the world is coming free of corona isolation and people are dying for some community and this is a trillion dollars idea.You're welcome Ryan Cohen, Elon, and AMC guy whoever you are idk.
Michael Burry (Christian Bale in The Big Short) is shorting Tesla stock, just something to keep in mind.
Hold TESLA the Hedgefunds are going to Attack Tesla as much as they can in order to drive down the price because they know where WSB is putting all their money in Tesla and they want to hurt us. We do not sell we diamond hands once we make our billions we need to reinvest tesla and save the other WSB autists
https://i.imgur.com/fWduUgk.jpgMy personal best trade ever, 2000% on Tesla puts holding 10k of 0DTE overnight Thursday into Friday, I was betting tesla would fall to the 21d ema which was about 1375ish, before it bounced higher200k profit
Remember when tesla was free money?
Pleas don't spend money you can't lose and don't base your expectations on what people memeing about the stock prices write here.While $GME stock prices might increase (and may not), the chances of it getting to $10k per share are very very unlikely.$10k per share means GameStop's market-cap is \~$720B. That's almost the same market cap as Tesla (\~$750B), and more than 3x Intel's market cap (\~$225B).
I‚Äôm selling all my Tesla and buying gme on Monday
Pelosi's stock moves are public knowledge and explicitly scheduled ahead of time. This whole story about her TSLA purchase is blown out of proportion -- she bought them the day that Tesla entered the S&ampP 500. There are enough reasons to dislike Pelosi that don't include deceptive, incendiary BS.
Bingo!!! I can't stop thinking about this. Vote with your wallet. I already ordered my Tesla, everyone else I know will drive one too. Solar panels, efficient housing and just companies that I love. This may be a huuuuge divestiture in oil coming... I dunno about you but I'm not supporting that shit with my future investments.
Wait for the announcement next week that tesla is actively pursuing a partnership to convert gamestops into dealerships. Or an exclusive deal with Microsoft for Xbox. I'm too retarded to add value here.
They are buying new shorts - its the default method of hedging. They did it with Tesla for example, constantly re-betting that the price will drop, over and over, for bigger and bigger money. Only to lose billions.  Here, they are WAY overleveraged and there are no stocks. And they have to pay massive interest. And we HOLD, which means they can't escape their situation.  Every effort to buy stocks after they played their big hand this week will give them smaller and smaller returns.
Y‚Äôall I used to be here last summer and these were the only things I‚Äôd read, Tesla memes, and people fucking dumping into silver and purple. I don‚Äôt want to say it‚Äôs always been five stocks but like the memes have always been five stocks
That‚Äôs the point. BB can be a meme and also be valued or even get to the point of being overvalued. Just as Tesla did
It's not that he can't afford it. It's that his wife sees it as a waste. He spent less than 50k on his personal car, but bought his in-laws a Tesla. Even though he's rich, he's not the type of person who regularly drops 50k on anything for himself. If this was 50k for a charity it would be no big deal for them
If u/DeepFuckingValue is still in, I‚Äôm still in. If GME is still most shorted stock by dollar volume after Tesla and Apple, I‚Äôm still in.
Except BB is crazily undervalued and TESLA is currently overvalued
Wait let me buy tesla calls first.... dammit all my money is in gme.  üôåüíéüöÄüöÄ
Exactly. Look at Tesla
Not at open. At least hold Monday. You know this is too much fun. Plus, you can‚Äôt buy a house with this much money. You might be able to on Tuesday though. By Friday? A mansion and a Tesla. Probably unlimited hookers.
Gyus, I read on a Tesla forum months ago that one should have a limited sell order on his stocks with a very high number (Say $10,000 for GME) thus the shorters can't borrow your stocks from the brokerage. Only idle stocks can be borrowed. Now you are buying and holding but the suckers are still able to borrow and sell. Otherwise if everybody is holding strong the price would not fluctuate that much.
He is 100% a hedge fund baby looking to keep suckling at daddies teat.He probably bought the shit himself and lied he drives a tesla...
Don‚Äôt buy a Tesla.... Do buy TSLA!üíéüôåüèΩ
Is this the guy who said short Tesla?
You mean what model Tesla am I buying
The year is 2037. GME is $320 share. Both sides have held their positions for a decade plus, at a complete stalemate. The trench warfare has led to distinct cultures and ways of life.Shorting hedge fund managers and their progeny now have a cult like worship of black holes. They believe the slow dissolve of their multi-generational wealth to interest rates is their holy birthright. Eventually they, like blessed light, will be absorbed entirely by the One True Lender Bank, and they will come out the other side clean and pure. They must not hasten the process, though, just as light cannot hasten its black hole rebirth. It was born with a direction and held it firmly, for eons.GME shareholders now live in a caste system. Citizens wear physical symbols of their number of shares, like pieces of flair. Children inherit their parents‚Äô flair, and weddings are arranged so as to strategically join the shares and average price of two families. The vehicle of choice is a Tesla Short Bus, and everyone prays to Deep Fucking Value each night. He answers their prayers by holding, and they honor him by doing the same.
  When all of you started this revolt at first, I didn‚Äôt totally understand what was going on. I felt there must be some foreign power involved that was using everyone here to make money. I just could not believe that all these people we actually willing to lose lots of money to do this. But now I understand so much more.This has gone from a protest to a revolt to a war very fast.  In a war there are always casualties on both sides. In all the greatest wars the side that comes out victorious is often then one where the troops/grunts believe in what the fight is for and about. I have come to the understanding now that this is the case here. You all are serious that you do not care if you lose the money you are using in the fight. This is because in this are the bullets are called the dollar bill. But at the same time if you are able to make money in the process this would be the icing on the cake.The first few people that I saw support this cause I was upset with. I was like how can you condone this they are cutting off their nose to spite their face. That was when I that this was a demonstration and protest. I now see this is not the case this is a war against what I understand and also have believed for a long time too. I watched what happened with Tesla, I read the lies and was very angry at what was going on.  I believed in what Elon was doing and felt that here was finally someone trying to fix everything that was fed in this world. So, I took what I could $7,000 and invested in into Tesla. For a long time, I lost money but I held true even when I only had about $3,000 left. Well, that money turned into more cash than I have ever had in my life at one time. To this day I still support Tesla and will continue to and not because I made money but because it is Elon and I believe in him to save this doomed world for real.When this all started, I lost about 15% of my investments and not because I‚Äôm a short but because there is a ripple effect across the entire market as this war is waged. I was in only two places and that was TSLA and ARKK. I closed the positions swearing at all that were doing this. Two days latter I saw this cause grow and figure out this is not some fake event made to make some other rich person richer. This is now a real war going on around me.There is a saying that someone that has nothing to lose has everything to gain and that is how I see this group feeling. This little bit of my life that I may sacrifice is nothing as my life is shit anyway. This could help me but what is more important is I fight for what I believe and that is in the corruption that I can no longer stand.Now I have a family that I have to worry about so I‚Äôm not able to go all in like the rest but I do want to help. I will take at this time $1,000 and put it in the cause knowing I will never see this. If and when others break rank because it is time I will not. Once the backs of the shorts have broke I will still hole. I will hold even when I‚Äôm the one left as I will not make $0.01 off of this trade. In fact, in my eyes, I have lost everything on this trade before I have even made it. This is not my money it is yours and I‚Äôm doing this because I can‚Äôt give the group the bullets they need to fight since there are so many of you but I can do this.Good luck to you all and I hope everyone here is able to at least end with more than they started with.I LOVE GME!!!!P.S. as I make more (I hope I will) off my other trades I will continue to add to my position no matter the price.I wish all the morons out there good luck and GOD LOVE you all!!!!
Dude‚Äôs driving a Tesla so I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call him an ‚Äúaverage person.‚Äù All the same, good on this above average person!
Did you reply "We don't have time to explain. Get in. We're going to the moon with a Tesla strapped to the rocket! üöÄüöÄüöÄüåôüåôüåô"
Tesla was shorted to hell and back before they hit their stride, and I think it‚Äôs left a bad taste for Elon. It‚Äôs hard to remember that Tesla didn‚Äôt turn a profit for years while spending massively and barely scraping by - Elon threw everything he had into the company and once they were able to ramp up production they finally hit profitability and the rest is history.
NOK/NAKED/TESLA/AMCüí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏COME ON!!!
Had 12k in tesla in Aug 2019 that I sold to pay for my wedding. Worth about 260,000 right now.
Remember my absolutely retarded beautiful mother fuckers. This is not about melivin any more. This is mote than a war. We are going to be controlling an entire wmpire if we just KEEP IT. THIS IS OUR TIME! To find our apple in the 90s! TO FIND OUR TESLA! EVEN CONTROLLING ONE SHARE AND NOT GETTING RID OF IT NO MATTER WHAT WE CAN BE RIDICULOUSLY RICH. I know most of you motherfuckers see this already, just clearing the fucking air here incase your smooth brain didn't catch on.
I have a Tesla.. make sure to get a newer one with updated mcu or you'll have a bad time. Unfortunately tesla is lacking customer service and try to make you foot the bill on warranty issues.
A member of this sub for a whole 3 days.In those days I have liquidated almost all my stocks (could not let Tesla or Nio go, but now thanks to this group know they too are heavily shorted) and sunk everything into AMC ($18) and GME ($300). Can not say my "nest egg" looks very good but I have never enjoyed investing this much. The community and the direction is awesome. Glad to be a part of it.Keep holding and press on!
LMAO. stop giving me awards - i drive a motherfucking tesla - go buy stuff from gamestop and donate it to children's hospitals!
and in a fucking Tesla too üëë
Damn, already got the Tesla.
Elon is well known for diluting adding more Tesla shares and the stock price still actually going up, it's basically free money to the company. Not even a loan, just providing more stock I forget the word it might be convertible notes or something but I remember years ago Elon diluted by over a billion and stock price went up enough that he actually added to his net worth by diluting his company, plus obviously got the cash infusion to make product
I bought a OTM Tesla call for $28. Sold it for $50.  Later in the day it was worth 10k.  Never forget.
I lost 5k on tesla weeklies last year :) i posted it (Attempted). Screw them and their Agenda!And to make my money back! BB to the üöÄüöÄ
Retard, now you can live in a tesla.
My favorite was the British kid that said he made gainz in i think Tesla from money he borrowed from his mom. And he was using that money to buy a ‚Äúhigh class‚Äù prostitute to lose his virginity. And everyone high fives the shit out of this retard. And he promised us pics of her tits with wsb written on them. The story was so awesome and the perfect level of autism for this group. And then the retard deleted his account and disappeared and we all realized we were hosed. Fuck that guy. He ruined one of my best moments of 2020
Anyone remember that Tesla guy who kept buying puts on Tesla and losing, and then he took out a pretty big loan and YOLO'D because he thought the Cybertruck reveal thing would be a disaster?Anyway, I think he lost everything lol
Buy the dip Tesla? No you moron, GME, always fuckin GME!!
The Tesla dip was today. No more dips please I have a weeklie
I will get back to selling potatos after this.Edit: FROM MY NEW LAMBOEdit: TESLA
It may be grossly overvalued, but the streets are littered with the corpses of Tesla shorters
One kid put 10k in calls on Tesla then let the contracts expire because he didn‚Äôt read up on how calls and puts work
Guy knows his stuff. He was clearly wrong about Tesla. Listen, but don't blindly follow.
Elon‚Äôs mission to get everyone rich enough to buy a Tesla so that every car on the street is a Tesla. 300IQ play
They fucked with Tesla so many times I hope they get crushed. And if it works out I'll use their money to buy a Tesla. And it gets a WSB sticker if course
It's an investment for him, he knows we will all buy tesla with our tendies
He also shorted Tesla at like 600 lol
Well for starters i lost 350k in tesla stock today
I gotta say, as a total noob to some of this, I have been more than impressed with the way I've been treated in this sub these past few days. I almost didn't ask some important questions because I was nervous of getting roasted or getting lost in these massive daily threads.Not only have folks been very helpful, there's not been a single unkind thing said to me about being a noob or that I should do more research.The morning Robinhood shut down trading (yesterday?), I had gotten up early to prep and watch the market. I was going to sell my couple shares of Tesla and go all in on GME. When the stocks were restricted, I panicked for a little while and then asked who was still trading.About an hour later I had a Fidelity account open, funded, and had 13 @219 of GME and 15 @8 of AMC.I told my CPA sister that I bought a few shares and she laughed, then told me to sell as soon as possible.I'm like, nah. I'll be polishing my üíéüëêüèº all weekend.
Gains like this are hard to replicate during normal circumstances, unless you have a shit ton of cash. This was a momentum play 100%. You'd have to have a stock low then fly like GME/AMC. It's like buying long dated calls when Tesla tanked last March then selling at their current prices.
1 tesla per share.... THAT MUCH
Man, I suggested to my family we should buy Tesla in 2012. I should have fucking pressed it.
Yea, he bought options so far out of the money that it was basically impossible for them to reach the strike price. Unless of course you‚Äôre Tesla and you‚Äôve had the most incredible run up in recent history. Nobody was buying these in 2019 and especially holding them this long. Crazy bets = crazy gains
I joined when Tesla was like $250 I watched so many people become millionaires from that
In a new Tesla I‚Äôve broken the mold, some may call my behavior uncontrolled, and to this I‚Äôm not opposed. I just keep composed, because these üåàüêªhave finally been exposed.
I mean the thing is I‚Äôve been kicked while down my entire life. Gotten up every time to be stronger and better. People cut from the same cloth think I‚Äôve gotten lucky, but it‚Äôs just pure grind and determination. So losing this money isn‚Äôt going to mean much because I will ALWAYS earn it back. It‚Äôs mine to lose.That said, this $1200 is money I‚Äôve saved. Not money I can‚Äôt afford to lose. I‚Äôve got my money for my rent and money for my car note and food. But other than that I will still have my credit debt, but it‚Äôs paid for a month so I‚Äôm okay for now. I‚Äôll just have $0 and have to go and earn that money back. And there‚Äôs a lot of people probably just like that joining the cause. However, I have been a lurker for quite some time. I almost yolod my 10k with you guys on Tesla until life happened. But all that to say this money is nothing to people who have made the grind to SURVIVE. We will always bounce back. But when these fucks lose their hands to someone like me they won‚Äôt know what to do. I doubt they know the cost of a gallon of milk. They think they know it all about life, but they don‚Äôt know shit. They don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to walk around the block at night with an eye over your shoulder only because you don‚Äôt have a car. They don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to light candles because you couldn‚Äôt pay the light. Fuck them. Our üíéüôå weren‚Äôt made from a 60% dip. They were made from the life we‚Äôve lived.
I was holding 200 Tesla for 2 years and the stock hovered around $250-$270, finally got tired and sold it for $252, now it is equivalent to $4000/share. Took a big hit.
It also doesn't take an expert to make money in the market.Anyone with 2 thumbs can buy and hold amazon, tesla, or now GME.
The guy who turned 500 into 1 million by accident because he forgot he bought long dated calls on tesla.He had more positions but this one I will never forget
I still remember when CNBC was losing their mind over Elon being "dIsReSpEcTfUl" to a prolific short seller on an earnings call. Literally a guy invested in wanting Tesla to fail lol
I joined few months back and saw people getting Tesla trendies. I didn't even know what calls and puts are. I just saw people getting millions and I sold my souls to wsbgods.
They tried to say Tesla was garbage for years
Why BlackBerry Stock Will Eventually Ride Much HigherBlackBerry's automobile and IT security products, along with its settlement with Facebook, will boost BB stock.Those who are bearish on BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) ‚Äî including the many people who are short-selling the name ‚Äî continue to vastly underestimate how much money the company can make. That‚Äôs because BlackBerry‚Äôs cybersecurity business is bolstering BB stock, with more upside on the horizon from connected vehicles and more. Basically, cybersecurity threats are becoming more prevalent as we advance technologically and this company stands to gain.MÔøºore specifically, the BlackBerry naysayers have failed to take into account the strength of the company‚Äôs security products like Spark. And that‚Äôs not all ‚Äî BlackBerry also has a very large payment in-store, which it‚Äôs likely to receive soon from social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).So, here‚Äôs why BlackBerry will climb much higher in the future.BB Stock and Connected CarsMorgan Stanley√Ç (NYSE:MS) embraced ‚Äúthe monetization of connected cars‚Äù this past November. Specifically, bank analyst Adam Jonas stated that ‚ÄúTesla is on the verge of a profound model shift from selling cars to generating high margin, recurring software and services revenue [‚Ä¶] [from] infotainment and performance upgrades.√¢¬Ä¬ù But instead of focusing on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the connected car space, I‚Äôd like to zero in on BB stock.Back in January 2018, I thought BlackBerry could make money by selling subscriptions through driverless cars. At the time, I wrote that it could sell ‚Äúads, data, extra security features, and apps‚Äù in the space. Now I believe that prospect is even more possible. The company can ‚Äî through its highly secure QNX operating system (OS) ‚Äî ultimately sell such products and services to the owners of all connected vehicles.Years ago, I noted something else, too: ‚ÄúBlackBerry can sell data that it obtains from consumers who use its self-driving operating system.‚Äù Now in 2021, the idea of collecting and selling data from drivers has become mainstream. Even the notion of selling extra car security features has been raised. In fact, only the thought of selling tracking systems and ads is less prevalent now. However, I still believe that the company will be able to sell such products.What BlackBerry SellsOne way to think about BlackBerry‚Äôs situation in connected cars is to compare it to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Of course, that company sells operating systems for computers. But just as Microsoft has made money from software sales, BB can profit from selling OSs for our increasingly tech-advanced vehicles.Sound odd? Well, Amazon‚Äôs (NASDAQ:AMZN) decision to work alongside the company to ‚Äúdevelop and market BlackBerry‚Äôs Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform‚Äù validates these offerings even further. Even Baidu√Ç (NASDAQ:BIDU) has gotten in on BlackBerry‚Äôs technology, opening up BB‚Äôs ability to meaningfully penetrate the Chinese auto market.Meanwhile, QNX has also been installed in other spaces, including applications in aerospace and defense, medical devices and ‚Äúindustrial automation.‚Äù With devices of all sorts now being connected to the internet, the number of endpoints that need the security BB provides will likely skyrocket.Spark Will Jump Start Revenue, Facebook Will PayClearly, BlackBerry‚Äôs upside is not limited to the connected car space alone. To that end, in May 2020, the company announced Spark Suites. This new security product will provide companies and governments with ‚Äúa range of tailored cybersecurity and endpoint management options.‚ÄùMore specifically, BlackBerry has integrated ‚Äúendpoint management, user authentication, and application and data encryption‚Äù from its original systems with ‚Äúartificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and automation for improved cyber threat prevention and remediation.‚Äù Altogether, this new product is a comprehensive and competitive development.Because of that, I believe that the strength of Spark will be able to meaningfully lift the company‚Äôs financial results over time.But that‚Äôs not the only boon for BB stock. On. Jan. 15, BlackBerry also announced that it had settled its patent-infringement lawsuit with Facebook. The dispute involves patents on messaging technologies, which are quite vital to FB‚Äôs huge business.As a result of the settlement, I expect BlackBerry to receive a large, multi-billion dollar payment from the social media giant. That‚Äôs sure to greatly boost BB stock, too.Bottom LineIt‚Äôs true ‚Äî√Ç right now, BlackBerry‚Äôs shares are very volatile. Why? The Reddit stock forum, Wall Street Bets (WSB), recently targeted it alongside other names in a massive short squeeze. That situation could continue for some time.But I‚Äôm convinced that BB stock will climb much higher over the long term. Given these points, I recommend that long-haul growth investors buy shares of BlackBerry now. Investors should also be prepared to buy roughly the same number of shares again if BB pulls back meaningfully in the near-term.
this is my hope. hoping it mirrors tesla in that shorts just contine getting burned all the way up until everyone is afraid to short the rabid cult.
I remember someone told me to buy Tesla, so I did and doubled my money. Not alot of money but it changed my life because I've been learning about trading ever since. Still dumb tho
Bought lots of Amc and put left overs in GAME (less then a stock) ... Do I sell what I have in Tesla and buy more Game or just hold the line!!!
I remember when the Tesla split happened, some random retard posted a thread about him going all in with his savings and even took out loans for Tesla puts. Everyone laughed him out saying tesla puts after a split was the worst idea ever. Tesla then went like 2 weeks on a downward spiral. I never saw an update from the dude, but I can only imagine he made it DFV big in true retarded WSB fashion

In the spring of 2018, I fell into a deep depression that forced me to quit my job and was essentially rendered useless for 6 months. During the summer of 2018, a fellow autist told me to dump my life's savings into Tesla.Didn't give a shit about my existence at the time so said YOLO and made the play. Sitting here years later having made about $400k on it.

The more gme grows, and amc. Amc to 115 by eom feb, the more spy goes down and Tesla.Now if we keep holding gme we cause the hedgers to sell their other assets, which thus causes spy to fall which in turn affects Tesla.Now Musk twittered on gme. Hear me out now, what if Musk is not only helping us give it to the hedgers but making it so his stock gets cheaper so that he, and us, can buy it with the money we make from gme and amc.(That‚Äôs our conspiracy theory for the day. Tune in next week when we examine the theory of giraffes actually being large deer)

Ugh could you imagine buying a Tesla model S with 1 share of gme
Welp. I feel its time to share my story for anyone who cares. I got into Robinhood last summer thinking I'd start casual and slowly learn about investing and stocks. I didn't pay much attention or do any trading. I had about $500 in mostly tesla and weed. Early January comes and I start actually trying to do something. So I messed around a bit on RH and did some reading about investing. I kept seeing WSB in my feed but never gave it much attention. Then about a week ago I saw a meme on one of my favorite subs about what was going on over here so I finally cane to check it out. And damn I wish I had given this sub a chance sooner. I bought 2 shares of GME at around $330. And I've been happy to be a part of this. The next day after getting more involved on this sub I was wanting to buy more so I put more of my savings into RH to buy when the market opened but then RH fucked me and all of us by preventing me from buying. I was pissed and it has made me want nothing more than to destroy these evil, manipulative rich suits. I'm so tired of the "elite" thinking they can win while screwing everyone else. Please let's do to them what they have been doing to us forever.I've managed to scrape together whatever I can to buy a total of 4 shares now. I'm scared and worried because I don't have a job and barely any savings left for my family to live on. But I am so invested in toppling this machine of scum that has destroyed so many in the past. I will hold. Every last one of you better hold as well. Only hours ago my wife came to me to tell me that she just bought a share herself. I guess three days of me screaming and yelling telling Robinhood and hedge fund fucks to get fucked finally convinced her to join in on the madness. I couldn't be prouder. I guess not being able to afford a honeymoon when we got married turned out alright because we will be heading to the moon on our combined 5 shares of GME. From a hopeful American and a beautifully loyal European wife I wish only the best to all of you holding onto this dream of change. Thank you all.

You know what would be amazing? We go to the moon, the stock eventually lowers, and then we all buy back in anyway and make gamestop resilient, without giving a shit about shorts. Everyone left holding the bag would get money back, everyone who makes it to the moon will have money to spare. Those who make money reinvest like it's a dip, it rises up again, and the stock lives on...out of pure spite... Like Tesla rocketing for a year straight.
Was not sure what to do. So I sold rest I had in Tesla and bought GME for it.
I could sell right now and buy a Tesla Model 3.I want a Model X.FUCKING HOLD RETARDS. ‚ô•Ô∏è
They want us to believe that 34m is normal for the hottest stock on the market when old news Tesla is trading at 25m and AMC is trading at 400m+. Actually pathetic ü§£.
Since shorters keep doubling down and new highs are we gonna end up with a long drawn out tesla like squeeze rather than a vw squeeze?

HOLD ON TO YOUR BLACKBERRY AND IF YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT YET, GET IT NOW!!!For those who didn't do enough research and is a newbie like me here is what I found and is a good enough justification to hold or buy and potentially buy more of BB. 1. BB is not your phone maker, they've transformed themselves to a software(more specifically auto - car software maker) and we all know by now that automobile industry is trending towards software updates(OTA updates) and auto pilot. Now the key point to note is that except TESLA most other automobile manufacturers don't develop their own software and have it outsourced, BB is already having a few major contracts and will only get better. 2. AMAZON recently invested in BB which means they definitely have a great future. History has shown that AMAZON makes strong and I mean really STRONG financial decisions. 3. BB has international presence which will allow them sell this software to not just American automobile manufacturers but major international automobile manufacturers(Luxury segment - VolksWagen, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda etc). Gents and Ladies you have a clear winner at your hand. Definitely worth the investment. HOLD and BUY!
Now I'm heated. No one limits trades when there is a crash. BUt God forbid people give some company some love and they throttle buying. No one throttled a damn thing when people were buying up Google, Tesla, Amazon, and Apple.  AMC should be above $100 by now. But they are limiting people buying. And what do we get? A finger wag by the SEC.
I‚Äôm gonna buy a Tesla with the vanity plate ‚Äústonks‚Äù when this is all over. Hold the line you beautiful retards.This is not investment advice, just a big monke with a phone and diamond fuckin hands üíéüôå
I'M BUYING A FUCKING TESLA WITH MY TENDIE. HOLD THE LINE RETARDS. ‚úäüèªüíé
Let's raise morale. What will you BUY with your new tendies?For me: Tesla, an actual house, some donations, and jumpstart a personal business. üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Don't you sell. My wife already thinks I'm an idiot for selling Amazon and Tesla to get in on this.
If tesla can be the pumped stably into the most valuable car company in the world, gamestop can get up there as the most valuable retail company in the world (bye bye Amazon!)
This terrifies them.There's fewer than 70mn in existence, and this stock has buyers all over the globe. A heap of people want to own at least one for the meme, for fomo. They don't even care about the floor, they just like the stock.This can hold a price high longer than anyone can stay solvent. Look at coins through Tesla through art through trading cards.Memes have value, all on their own. Supply and demand matters, and they should have thought a lot harder before shorting a low value stock to 130%+.
imagine GameStop pulls a Tesla Short-Shorts meme and sells t shirts that say ‚ÄúGameStonk‚Äù on them lmaoo would sell out immediately
We'll build a pyramid at the rest area too, why not? It will have charging ports for our Tesla spaceships.
amc taking that tesla powered rocket
Until $gme issues more shares and reaps the high share price - similar to what Tesla did last year
WE won't sell until the moon.LIKE Tesla it will be a great boon.THE hedge funds played their hand too soon.STOCK market manipulators, this is your doom.

Don't worry elon when this is over I'll buy a car off you and put 1/4 of my portfolio in Tesla
Hedge funds are liquidating. Tesla is down more than 5%. Apple more than 3%. Multiple big stocks are down. They are preparing to throw everything and dump GME into oblivion, I‚Äôm talking catastrophic dips, please be prepared to hold. They‚Äôll dip the entire stock market before close if they have to. Hold and buy the dip
Pelosi gonna waltz into SEC offices and pull out her milk jug tits causing GME to get shut down and save her tesla calls
Holy shit Tesla. Good night sweet prince...
So people the thing is, if you are new to the game (no pun intended), you heard on social media etc. You want to join a cause, you like it when people (normal people) achieve something as a community and you want to be part of it and make some money on the way. Then hooold it like you steal it and don't talk about it. Hold it till the day you want to play cyberpunk on your new tesla.
Real talk why‚Äôs tesla and apple doing so bad rn? Is everyone rotating into GME and AMC?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn6rYutgS0wthis dude is my background music for the day. help him get that tesla!
He thinks its overvalued and will come down. But with how high on coke and cheap FED Money the market is, this will probably not materialize until Tesla stops growing its marketshare. So he probably will keep his track-record of being 2-3 Years early.
&gtThis is not about the Big Boys, who will undoubtedly screw up or miss something again. Its about those Idiots screaming about AMC and Nokia and such.

BB TESLA PARTNERSHIP COMING SOON. YALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Tesla potentially partner with BlackBerry in next month buy now
Take us to 60k!! I need a Tesla!!
I am relatively traditional in how I invest, have a sizeable gold position in my portfolio as well as I did try to short Tesla and lost $2-3k whiled doing so (I still consider it biggest bubble in the market). I considered wsb as a joke.However, this week things have changed and so did my views. I think the business case of short squeeze is real and on top I want to see the hedge funds burn. Tore up my portfolio, GME, BB and AMC are about 30% of its net value. Excessive risk but I don't care now.
Fee to short Tesla 0.30%Fee to short GME 29%113% of GME Float is still shorted.  So in simplest form they‚Äôre paying 29% interest on their short positions while they wait for our üíé üôå  to give up. HOLD üöÄ
This is self serving.  The case for Tesla is about price manipulation to the upside not to the down side.  The FSD claims you make are wrong. Elon also said 1 million robo taxis by last year.  He did a press conference with a painted piece of glass (read the court documents) and said it was a solar shingle.  Elon is the richest man in the world.  This is not what you claim it is.  In fact.  Given the outrageous premium places on Tesla options buying them in facts pumps cash to citadel.  Tesla options have been one of citadels greatest profit centers.  Look it up
Do i sell my Tesla for AMC?üöÄüöÄ
Elon you put a significant amount of money in this I will be buying a brand new tesla

As much as I love all the momentum right now, I hope in a couple months we can go back to talking about Cathie and Tesla and Baba. The daily is basically unusable for anything but GME, BB, and AMC.
Are apple and tesla dropping because hedges are dumping shares to cover shorts?
Not selling these $40 BB calls until we hit $50 by next week üò§ DADDY NEEDS A TESLA
Short story.I bought Tesla at $900 pre split because everyone else was and I didn't want to miss out (FOMO)It dipped a little bit for a few consecutive weeks and I panicked and sold.A week later it hits $1100, then $1500 it almost hit $2000 before they split the stock. The current value would be over $4000 and I sold for fuck all.HOLD!!!!!
I have 30 bucks in NOK with $5 weekly buys in Tesla, Apple, and Disney. If these shrubs keep pulling their longs to buy more shorts imma be fucking set on my longs. These stupid MFs

GET THIS SHIT POPPING SO I CAN AFFORD A TESLA FOR MYSELF, MY WIFE, HER BOYFRIEND, AND HIS WIFE
Honestly Gamestop &gt&gt&gt Tesla.  I like Gamestop, it is a very nice little store.
Sold my Tesla calls boomer stock of 2021. Now GME is the new tendiemachone of 2021
Again I am asking for you help! Jesus take this wheel of camry and turn it into a tesla $BB 40c 1/29 2.0
Tesla will be using B for currency soon Check Elon Twitter handleMara and riot will quadrapleeee
Got rid of my stop losses, sold all my positions in Tesla, SPY, and NIO.All in on GME. Let‚Äôs make them bleed!United we stand, divided we fall!
Only if the van is Tesla van and has Cyberpunk on the monitor.
We buy Tesla here, son.
Today is the most important day of this entire week. Be strong, Hold the line, and we get the infinite price squeeze we have all been dreaming about. I cant wait to get my new Tesla Model S plaid + after this
‚ÄúMy proceeds from the PayPal acquisition were $180 million. I put $100 million in SpaceX, $70m in Tesla, and $10m in Solar City. I had to borrow money for rent.‚Äù-Elon Musk Don‚Äôt Fucking quit! The Show Goes On!!!
If gme turns into the new Tesla, meaning shorts get their teeth kicked in every single time they try and short, I will get diamonds tattood on my hands.
never thought i‚Äôd see the day on this sub where tesla is a boomer stock. crazy times here
He can't say since he already was fined for stock manipulation and has way too much followers. But I would be VERY surprised if he didn't use this opportunity to give back to the short sellers who worked against Tesla for years.
I sold my Tesla stock to partake in this fucking shit show! Let‚Äôs go, Retards!
Remember when Melvin shorted Tesla when Musky was just trying his best to help climate change? I remember and also know Tesla is a great company. You guys are just giving Game Stop another shoot during a pandemic when they need it the most.
Considering I made 20x on Tesla... It's rare, but it happens more often.
was it too late buying Tesla at 300$ sitting now at 800+? 2 Days ago people were laughed at for buying at 150$. Not too late.
I don't think he canThe investors have his balls tied up with Tesla,if he bought a single option Tesla will fall to the fucking ground.BUT,nothing stops his co-workers or employees to do that.
Think about which Tesla you want to buy with your gains guys üí∏
should all go Tesla with our new winnings after this is over
No one discusses the biggest elephant in the room:The market is about investing in companies we like. Tesla didn‚Äôt end up where they are by some random idiots, it was an idea of a better future and early investors piled in.GameStop is not Blockbuster. Blockbuster only sold candy and popcorn, and RENTED movies. As the internet got faster, the need for them waned. But GameStop sells merch, you can buy card booster packs for the games we love, they have a brand presence in gaming only rivaled by the companies that make the games we love. Thousands of employees and even more so, millions of fans. But they would rather take GameStop and carve it up, lose jobs, and make society poorer just because they like to pretend the stock market is a casino where a fucking chart determines the price.No, we saw a company on the verge of bankruptcy and we decided to save it. That‚Äôs not manipulation, that‚Äôs charity. Fuck it I‚Äôm taking off work to go hang out with the managers at GameStop tomorrow, buy all their Pok√©mon boosters for Shining Fates, and get that Pok√©mon Ball Plushie that I‚Äôve been eyeing ever since I moved and now live near them.Kids are literally taking money from the dragons sleeping on their pile of gold and the dragons are trying to ‚ÄúREEEEEEEE‚Äù but trickle down economics means someone gets pissed on.Let‚Äôs piss on them tonight.
Alright hear me out guys they are going to go after TESLA the hardest.... Papa Elon is one of us and they are going to try to make TESLA worthless... they know that WSB has the most money invest in Tesla and they are going to try to hit us where it hurts we need to cover the TESLA dip once we do get our gains....Elon deserves it ..., WSB deserves it..... The world deserves ....GME TO THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
 Remember when people thought it was nuts that Tesla his 420. Now we‚Äôre all watching GameStop hit it and not even remotely satisfied.
Tesla I would assume
What color Tesla y'all getting?
Wait so are expecting a dip in Tesla? I mean discount
Elon, throw a bil at us, well buy Tesla‚Äôs we promise. We memed Tesla this high, do us a fav.
MAKE SURE TO BUY A TESLA WITH YOUR TENDIES AND WATCH FOR YOUR TAXES!!!!!!!!!!
Must admit yesterday I almost caved. Felt low.Took a decision. Banked all my Tesla and Square profits to cover me and decided to watch this burn to zero if I have to. Worst case scenario now is I lose money I never had a few months ago. I want to be on the right side of history here no matter what.
Dumped Tesla for GME LETS GO
If only Elon would say, ‚Äúliquidated 1% of my Tesla holding to buy GME.‚Äù
I'll be going right to Gamestop and buying a few USED games, toys and accessories. And a Tesla.
Going to buy Tesla shares after this is all said and done for Daddy Elon.
Going to buy some shares for Tesla after this for Daddy Elon.
ATTENTION NOOBS: WE USED TO MAKE MONEY OFF TESLA WEEKLIES ON THIS SUB. ONCE WE ARE SQUOZE, prepare to do that again

Engineer who grew up with blackberry phones supporting engineers in BB. Love that you didn‚Äôt give up all these years. You can do it! BB hope to see you in the EVs in future. $13,000 in. Burn it if you wish, hope it can fuel you up up up! Always hated the rich fat pigs sitting nice and swanky and stepping on honest hardworking firms like Tesla BB GME to get up. Don‚Äôt die BB love you.üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Help us out here, Elon!Free $GME share with every Tesla delivery in the next 6 months?You could weld a physical share into the dashboard.
Imagine your credit card has a 30-60% interest rate. Now imagine you bought 5 million Tesla on your credit card. And now imagine you don‚Äôt pay any of that off your credit card. How long do you think you can last for while the interest rate eat you alive for the rest of your life.
I have a limit sell for 1 share at $1800, because as much as I like the sounds of 5 tickets to the moon, 4 tickets to the moon on some short sellers dime sounds even better.  üöÄüöÄüöÄ the other 4 limits are way deep.  Maybe not lambo deep, but Tesla deep for sure.
New here, love you guys. I'm very excited for today. I could see it going two ways-1. We (I'm including myself in the "we" even though I only have one share of GME, but I'm sure as shit not selling until I can buy a race car with it) stay strong, hedge funds bleed money, selling their long positions to cover the shorts of GME. If this happens, could be a bloodbath for all non-meme stocks.2. We puss out, it turns into a normal Friday, and the suits write this chapter in the history book.From my perspective, it's better to be out of every non-meme stock tomorrow given the possibility we win. If we win on this, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, whatever isn't GME, AMC, BB, NOK will all lose. That's just supply and demand. If you have a position in them, selling today gives you the chance of buying at a big discount next week.
WE ARE THE ECONOMIC HEROES. Just be sure to buy stonks Monday morning in addition to a lambo/tesla
I'M DRIVIN' MY TESLA DOWN TO AMC TO WATCH A MOVIE ABOUT GAMESTOP WITH A BLACKBERRY IN MY POCKET
The fundamentals for BB are there, yet it‚Äôs being shorted - if that doesn‚Äôt convince you that there‚Äôs obvious illegal market manipulation I don‚Äôt know what will.Remember Tesla, this was shorted by the same guys to oblivion.
I‚Äôm going to buy a Tesla Model S with my earnings straight from Melvins üßªü§ö
Alright, if you bitches sell im gonna cry. Just think about all the gains you will make, if you want a tesla üíé‚úä super glue your hands together. Just don't sell.
Doubt it lol. But if the price goes to that point then the societal collapse will mean you can steal a Tesla without consequences
I bought in at $38. 1 share. Am I going to be able to afford a new Tesla anytime soon?
Short sellers tried to take down tesla initially and he was pretty outspoken about how hard it is to run a company when the cards are stacked against the metric that you're being judged on.
How much do you guys think tesla will be when we use our infinite tendies to support our savior?
Exactly. Tesla raised $15 billion last year like this. A capitol raise could save the company and the jobs for all those kids who didn‚Äôt just buy GameStop instead of working for them.
Sleeping on the couch day #3 until I make enough money to buy my wife a Tesla YGME 60 shares @ 265 avg üíé‚úã
Tesla is forming a batman pattern. With no stimulus in sight, poor guidance, and people chasing memes, i could see it retract to 700
If you want to buy a Tesla, you must pay in GME.  The dollar bill is dead to me. I only accept GME now.
Wearing my tesla short shorts for good luck, I‚Äôve prepped wellEDIT : This is not financial advice just my opinion
You can buy your own Tesla if it does.
This. Some guys just don‚Äôt want to trade or hold penny stocks. Some guys believe things like Amazon, Apple, and Tesla will prosper. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfair for them to get a chance to play in those markets as well.
Ok buddy. You owe me a tesla if it does.
i sold my tesla and spy for this, gme went from 13% of my portfolio to 75%, let‚Äôs goooooo
I need a bro. I need a fucking brother right now. I need advice.I fucked up. I had a stop loss limit on and it sold my 61.5 shares at 140 this morning while I was driving to work. I thought I would be good because when I left the price was fucking 480. I didn't expect that volatility. COULDN'T BUY BACK BECAUSE OF FUCKING ROBINHOOD. I wouldnt mind losing 10 shares in a situation like this. BUT 61! FUCK.I bought at 40. I read my DD's, I read my DD's I sold my Tesla stock for this. One Yolo. One Shot. I fucked up my one shot at taking my foot off the gas pedal for a minute with life. I don't need to be teased or made fun of because of this, I know, I know I shouldn't have had a stop loss etc.If I buy at open I can only recover around 1/3 or possibly LESS of the shares of GME I had.OR.... Risk it again. YOLO -- fuck it and wait on a dip and recover it all. I know it isn't financial advice because we are all retards. Love you brothers and sisters. Been diamond handsing with the best of them for a long time on different accounts (this is a new one because I was once doxxed) but I slipped. Love y'all. Regardless I am buying again.&amp#x200BDunno if I wait on a dip or YOLO at open... I want an easy fucking life man. üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ
How many GMEs for a nice Tesla?
Hear me out: Elon should join forces with AMC for a drive in movie theater....AND partner with Gamestop to power Tesla consoles
funny i can buy $2000 1/29 tesla calls today but not a share of gme amc or a bunch of others. is this the ‚Äúprudent investing‚Äù he was trying to promote ü§î
Take it from OP. How he ended up on WSB was blowing dudes behind his local Wendy‚Äôs dumpster.  Stacked enough nickels that way and was able to fomo into some decent options.  Now his wife‚Äôs boyfriend has a Tesla.
Buy a tesla instead to support elon
yeah, maybe its different this time since Elon hates shorts for trying to kill Tesla and Joe loves Elon so much he put on the pink dress shirt.
selling tesla at open so hopefully I GME and BB is still open to trade. if so we got 5k of help coming
Ngl I‚Äôm a smooth brain retard following the pack. Before 3 days ago I was flipping Tesla stocks for 20 cents a week as a hobby. I‚Äôm trying to learn though.
Watching Wolf of Wallstreet to recharge my Tesla and GME batteries to leave this fucking universe!
Too low imo.  100k.  I'd like to be able to buy a Tesla with my 2 shares.
It looks like a waiting game. Some are waiting it out ‚Äî they think retards will move on and the crowd will find a new toy. Some covered, but others jumped in thinking it is overvalued, opening new short positions. People think it‚Äôs so absurd that GME is like 15B market cap, but I genuinely think it‚Äôs less absurd than NIO at 90B or Tesla at 850B. It‚Äôs just the rate of change that is crazy. I would take GME at 40B with the Chewy guys building out digital sales and a meme cult status, wayyyy over NIO at 90B. IM A RETARD ON THE INTERNET DONT TAKE MY ADVICE. I just like this stock üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Keep buying y‚Äôall. Trying to buy my cat his own Tesla with this bad boy.
what colour tesla you guys getting? i‚Äôm thinking a dark, metallic turquoise myself
What is everybody‚Äôs sell price. I‚Äôm aimin for 10k, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôll take to get a Tesla !
Honestly I feel like everyone has to go through this once or twice. I did last year with Tesla, held a couple shares at $200 and sold shortly after
Aside from Tesla GME was the only supremely undervalued stonk I knew of.
If the value stays high, eventually game management will have to sell shares in a debt for equity swap to refinance the company (see Elon's genius move at Tesla). They'd be negligent not to add it could stave off bankruptcy for years or decades.We just need to buy those up when the time comes.
after what went down today. i'm selling my tesla shares and a portion of my apple shares and throwing all into gme. fuck this rigged ass system YOU GONNA DRAG THESE STOCKS FROM MY COLD DEAD DIAMOND HANDS CUZ IM BUYING AND NOT LETTING GOüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Robinhood gives a free Tesla when you join now?
Tomorrow I get paid! And I don't eat for a week! GMEüöÄüåù! I'll be eating all I want in my yacht and tesla!
the Gamestop/Tesla Esports league on the moon!
Hey dickhead, so so so sorry you can't afford that 3rd fuckin' yacht right now to poison the waters of my children's future. But don't get mad bro - I will be thinking of you 100% when I drop off my kids at a good school in my new Tesla, after all you and your greedy limped-dick brethen helped fund it with your greed - so I guess thank you?PS: If you make a bet and lose, be a fuckin' man and take your losses :)
It happens.My husband and I  missed out on the $12 million jackpot years ago, we missed out on bitcoins when it was $13 each, we missed out on the beginning of Tesla, and Sprint/Gamestop when they were so cheap.There will always be losses and missed opportunities, but the ones that got rich?  They probably had hundreds of losses before their luck turned around.Hang in there.  Your luck will turn around.
With all the money made on GME we hop onto the Tesla hype train then TO THE FUCKING MOOOON
Haha we all have conviction. To $10,000 we go. Then make sure we donate it all back to charity over the course of our lives. Also, Tesla roadster 2.0 space-x edition as a thank you to Papa Elon
üòíSpeak for your self, I took my Tesla üòé
I sold my tesla stock and bought more GME. I'm so sorry elon! But I feel like you gave us permission with your gamestonks tweet!I promise to buy a tesla vehicle with my GME gains if it all pans out. So still a win for tesla!I was so upset, I saw it drop to 129 a share and right away tried to grab more but by the time I typed in the order it was already at 169. Still a good price!
I'm hoping Elon joins us retards to smash these shorts once and for all. üíØ when we get to Andromeda the first shop we're going to is Tesla.
**The short position on Tesla is over $47,348,964,600** ($47 billion)The short position on TSLA is much MUCH larger than all the meme stocks **COMBINED**.Elon did it once and burned the shorts and we can now do it again, if you don't think we can move Tesla you are underestimating the power of autism.
Aside from the class action suits, Gamestop, AMC, etc have real cases for damages. The brokerages certainly didn't collude when Tesla was acting irrationally for the last year.
Elon needs to appoint u/DeepFuckingValue as the Chief Short Squeezer at Tesla
We are going for the long shot bro, just buy and hold till you can buy 1 Tesla for every share you have. It's going to at least 42 000$. This is the real infinite money printer
I don't feel bad, it could go to 0 and I would be chill. This exact money started off as $2k in Slack then $3.5k in Lemonade, now $7.5k in GME and then I have other gains in Tesla and Palantir. Never would have invested if it wasn't for seeing people posting here.
Goddamn it, if we can get it to hit a dollar, I‚Äôm buying a Tesla
we hold until the one share babies can afford a tesla!
Dude, if Elon puts the last nail on Melvin's grave, I'll take out a loan to buy a Tesla, and its stocks. And I've been staunchly against loans my entire adult life.   Elon, if you're reading this, I'll give you whatever proof you want to show I'm not bullshitting. Not that you'd care, cause if I bought a whole fleet it'd probably be a drop in the bucket, but still.
I fucking lose $75k last June selling naked calls on tesla (yes I know, RETARDED!). Did TD help me out? Fuck no they clapped my ass and collected their money IMMEDIATELY. I took my beating and lived to trade again. I fucked up, not elon for tweeting some bullshit or whatever catalyst blew my strike out by a mile. They didn't give a fuck about me entering the trade, and I don't need them holding my hand obviously, but them pretending to care about us now is infuriating. They'd happily allow me to do the same fucking trade again in a heartbeat. I'm legit going to be depressed when nothing happens about any of this and we somehow get fucked.
I honestly think GME big dick energy is here to stay.  GME is gonna pull a Tesla.
RECENT DIP LOOKS LIKE A TESLA EMBLEM.ITS A SIGN FROM DADDY ELON
This is not a Republican or Democrat issue.  This is a corruption issue, [whether it's Inhoe, Feinstein, Burr and Loeffler selling before the crash last year](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/488593-four-senators-sold-stocks-before-coronavirus-threat-crashed-market) or [Pelosi buying Tesla stock at the EV push](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/nancy-pelosi-buys-25-tesla-call-options-may-benefit-from-joe-bidens-ev-push-6403871.html).  We need an amendment: "No elected US Government official, nor judge, nor their immediate families, may financially benefit from a private industry they were involved in regulating."
Yo Elon bro wtf? You better dump like 10 mill on Gme and BB or I won‚Äôt buy that Tesla I promised
When this is all said and done I'm getting a picture infront of gamestop with my new Tesla I'm going to purchase after GME MOONS. BOYS. DIAMOND HANDS CANT STOP WONT STOP GAMESTOP. ALL OR NOTHING. FUCK THE HEDGEFUNDS
I just don‚Äôt believe any broker is worried about saving it‚Äôs customers. Like you let us buy Tesla FDs 1DTE. They‚Äôve always known it was a casino so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm most suspicious. Like can‚Äôt even buy AAL really??
SPY is one of the most , if not THE most, liquid and easily tradeable security in the world. It‚Äôs also based on the SPX which cannot be bought or sold and so SPY is continually kept on a short leash by arbitrage traders and algos. So I see what you‚Äôre saying but SPY specifically is a bad example in this case.TSLA is a better comparison. Shorted into the ground but hyped by everyone here for years. The difference between TSlA and GME? Tesla had yuuuge backing from big big players like Cathy. Also Elon was from the OG PayPal mafia and was already a billionaire with other billionaire buddies. The ridiculous market cap has continued to be defended because of institutions holding long.Now to GME: beyond people shorting it it is EXPENSIVE AS FUCK TO CLEAR THOSE TRADES. The bullshit part of it is that the ONLY reason there was so much volatility in the first place is because of the short squeeze. If they weren‚Äôt short to begin $GME would have never gone over $40 let alone $20.Basically what these fuckers did was change the rules right before market open and All of the trading platforms had no choice or risk having all their clearing house privelages taken away.
On on our Nokias while driving a Tesla running on BlackBerry‚Äôs EV technology
Papa playing key role todayAll my profit going to tesla
These same people shorting Gamestop tried shorting tesla last year no? He despises them more than any of us
Daddy Elon,  I love you and my next car will be a Tesla.
He has 25% of tesla shares and the company went boom. what do you suggest he should do? even if he wanted to donate his 50% of his money, it'd take him more than 20 years to liquidate 50% of his shares.
So many folks texting me talking shit knowing full well I'm invested. As if calling me a retard for losing money today has any effect. I knew DFV was holding and I am but a poor fuck who bought in from the jump. I doubted him only from 15$ to 30$. Only due to me being in the market since the Apple and Tesla split. That amount of time allowed me to understand the situation. Call me retarded friends, family and foes. Enjoy watching my success from the nose bleed seats. I'm still fucking holding. üíéüôåüíéüçÜ
He hates melvin because they shorted tesla
*Cracks neck* *puts on Tesla Short Shorts*The bleeding beast has finally stirred... the real fight starts now!Sell nothing. Give them nothing! If they want to walk away from this its going to hurt them and they're going to have to fight an army of diamond handed retards.
Let no soldier be left holding the bag this time comrades. This time is different. This is war. We are turning our bags into diamonds. Taking the tendies away from the hedgefund elites and into the mouths of the working class. We like this stock. Holding until every WSB user owns a tesla
Get Elon on the phone. GameStop with couch theaters and awesome gaming setups brought to you by AMC with Tesla chargers outside.
I‚Äôm sure these fucks are saying this about Tesla right now. Oh wait.
I don't think Tesla is worth more than $3 a stock, so I will not allow you to buy Tesla stock until it is
So he can sell video games for the upcoming TESLA integrated console so you can play while the car drives itself. That's the endgame.
GAMESTOP sells gamesTESLA vehicles screens have gamesELON YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?$$$$$$$$$$$$$
"Look, sure this Tesla has four miles on it, but it's used, so I can give you $65 cash or $67 in store credit"
I‚Äôd legit buy a Tesla if gme mooned tomorrow and I could get out with the funds

Got it. I'm a retard that didn't expand the reply you were responding to. I just saw your reply under Tesla and got confused. Carry on with üíé ‚úã!
I agree, the cobalt mines was bad, though I dont think it was entirely his idea, Tesla is a company and not everyone answers to the top
Guys, after this GME war we should all buy Tesla. Elon is only brave soul who fucks these brokers.
she already has one man, why do you think i work so hard, gotta pay for his fucking tesla
I was going to stay out of it,  but I sold my tesla to buy two shares.  All I could do, don't care if I loose it.They crossed the line when they pulled the crap they did this morning.Ape Strong
Just bought 140 shares this evening. Thanks to DFV for his initial thesis, and for putting in the work to present a golden DD that showcases the reality of business and big finance in the US and around the world.Why should only big money decide who gets to live and who goes down under?I'm in this company because I believe in its status as a symbol of a modern age story of change, adaptation, innovation and community or grass-roots backed financing.If it weren't for Tesla and the people who believed in it, when all the big hedge funds were trying for years to put it down under, who knows where we would've been today in EV tech and industry.GME, for better or worse, is waking people up to the realization that we, as individuals, still possess the same power as we always have: the power to unite, collaborate and structure ourselves around ideas in order to bring them to reality.People are starting to realize that not only can they affect change in their societies by the power of their vote, but they can also do it by the power of their wallet, regardless of its weight. Same as in social activism, financial activism relies on organizing ourselves, in chasing reform and change that has positive impact on our local and global communities alike.Wealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy. The system is wide and far-reaching and we must use everything available to us so that we may carve the life we want for ourselves and our children.GME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs. There is real potential here, why should they go bankrupt just because a handful of suits decided it's in their own best financial interest?Save and transform! Enough killing and profiting off of it.I'm sending a message, as I know you all are. This will be heard and this will have an impact. Never stop believing this.Remember, change is a long game of attrition which will be won only by those who will endure its tides.I am not selling! Fired up and ready to fucking go!

Same as in social activism, financial activism relies on organizing ourselves, in chasing reform and change that has positive impact on our local and global communities alike.Wealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy. The system is wide and far-reaching and we must use everything available to us so that we may carve the life we want for ourselves and our children.GME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs. There is real potential here, why should they go bankrupt just because a handful of suits decided it's in their own best financial interest?Save and transform! Enough killing and profiting off of it.I'm sending a message, as I know you all are. This will be heard and this will have an impact. Never stop believing this.Remember, change is a long game of attrition which will be won only by those who will endure its tides.I am not selling! Fired up and ready to fucking go!
You know why this shit never happened to Tesla, despite similar meteoric rise and massive PE ratio? Because institutions were in on that stock and made money too. The only reason they‚Äôre doing all of this for GME is because they‚Äôre not in the position to win on the trade.
In an alternate universe Elon buys 10%+ of GameStop triggering the greatest MOASS of all time. He creates a partnership with Tesla and installs superchargers at all locations. Builds arcades inside the retail locations.. A literal GameStop!
Choosing the color of my Tesla now
Lmao. I would absolutely buy a Tesla if that happened.
Damn and Tesla still down
I mean he doesn‚Äôt owe us shit but to be fair a large part of Tesla being as high as it is is due to WSB and no thanks to melvin and citron and other shorts...Juss sayin‚Äô
Tesla is fucking killing me
I love how they stopped GME today, wasn‚Äôt Tesla‚Äôs volatility crazier? Why not stop Tesla back then? Hedge funds need to learn a lesson

Elon with the üíéüíéüíé nuts! This dude having our back is huge. I'm glad they shorted Tesla and he wants to see them pay üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Wonder if Elon will loan me $100k to buy gme if I promise to put it back into tesla?
After this shit is over can we pump tesla and reward elon for helping us out
Tempted! Will 38 @ 88 get Tesla level?
Tesla calls and shares after GME squeeze - or at least buy a Tesla. The man needs to be honored.
This guy knows. Shorts almost bankrupt Tesla a few times. Imagine the innovation these fuckers would have robbed humanity of - all just to fill their pockets. Cunts.
what colour tesla yall buying after this
I‚Äôm buying A Tesla bro, get the real deal! Shares too :*
When this is over I'm definitely buying some tesla shares. He deserves it, because he stands on our side
AMC GME  - when we bank I'm buying a Tesla! Thanks for standing up for the little guys Elon!
I don‚Äôt even want children, but I‚Äôm considering it now. I want grandchildren doing the whole Mars Tesla GameStop hologram Nintendo thing too
I have a feeling, papa musk and chamath might drop in big bucks tomorrow right before market close (we need to maintain 200$ to make hedgies bend the knee) . These are the same people that shorted tesla so this is personal. my recommendation is STICK TO THE PLAN, HOLD, REMOVE SELL LIMITS TILL FRIDAY AH.
HAVING PAPA ELON ON OUR SIDE MAKES ME WANT TO BUY EVERY TESLA MADEüöÄüíéüñêüèª
Alright I‚Äôm sold on Elon finally- I will buy a Tesla!
Papa Musk is the man... I will buy a Tesla with my GME gainzWe retards also buy stuff on Amazon. I think Daddy Bezos owes us a tweet.
I just went to SoFi and sold a bunch of my looooong held Tesla that I swore I wasn‚Äôt touching for at least 20 years and bought more GME. I was already in, but now I‚Äôm in deeper. Fuck Robinhood and fuck anyone who won‚Äôt let us decide what to do with our money. My wife‚Äôs boyfriend is gonna be proud. GME to the moon. üöÄüíéü§≤
Once this Rollercoaster is over everyone should dump a ton of their profits into Tesla
 Love my Tesla stock....but should I drop it to buy more stocks for the squeeze and then buy back my Tesla babies?
Once this is over we should pull all our shares and securities out of every brokerage firm and buy shares Directly into Tesla. Papa will protect us.
Musk joins the fight - I'm ordering a Tesla.
THE ONLY REASON DIPS EXIST IS TO MAKE BUYING EASIER.SELL YOUR TESLA BUY GMEGME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

I‚Äôm fucking livid I had the cash in RH to buy a shit ton of both. I never have cash for when these exciting market things happen, so I made a point of it by parking it in safe boomer stocks after Tesla, now I‚Äôm gonna be waiting 2-5 days. Fucking corruption fucked me, I need in on this class action.I might even get out my calculator to prove damages, ha. Can‚Äôt be as upset as some people though as I did manage to buy 225 shares of AMC when someone was trying to dump a bunch for cheap yesterday evening in extended hours trading.
yup, made about 3.5k thanks to tesla and some other gas companies here at the first ish covid lockdowns, lost it all to "omg its going straight down -15% blabla and then it coming back up a few days later" and just profited 200‚Ç¨here i made +5k in a day, then proceeded to be at -16k just as fast, HOLD
"I am a remote worker for Tesla. I wanted to let you know that Elon Musk's daily breakfast consists of dead babies by order of the Biden Administration. I'm sure you understand why I need to post this anonymously, but believe me - it is true. I overheard it myself."My example is hypothetical and false, but there is no more reason to believe it than to believe the random originator of this comment.
Elon needs to liquidate tesla and put 100 bil in GME
Im buying a Tesla...No. Im buying TWO teslas with all the Hedge Fund Tendies
Speaking it into existence: **when** gme goes $5k I‚Äôm buying a white Tesla
Remember guys, it took months of losses and billions upon billions for the shorters to cave on their Tesla positions. We‚Äôre dealing with people who obviously think they are gods, which is why even today they doubled down on their short position. GME is still heavily shorted, so just fucking hold.

Trading212, a subsidiary of IBKR for uk customers has stopped users from BUYING stocks for months now on a number of stocks like Tesla, snap, snow and a ton of other volatile stocks. This list now of course includes the big trio of this week. If robinhood gets hit with a lawsuit can these fucks get it too?
Chamath, winkle woss, Elon, AOC and even Ben Shapiro and many more are opening rooting for us. Remember when Melvin were shorting tesla? Elon knows what that feels like
I wish. But SEC and Tesla would have an absolute field day with him if he did.
We have our own EV company called Tesla. We have our own movie theatre üé≠ called AMC. We have gamestop not sure what they do. we should have our own bank. Is Goldman Sachs for sale ? Upvote this shit !!!
Papa Musk knows that if 1M retards becomes millionares, there will be 1M new tesla orders. I'm holding on to my 40 shares to at least 4 digits!
 The year is 2041. I‚Äôm at home watching TV with my wife and kids. A trailer comes on for a movie called, ‚ÄúThe Big Squeeze‚Äù. A single tear runs down my face. My wife puts her hand on my leg she knows. My kids say the want to see the movie, so we make plans to see it later that day. We get into our Tesla, in-part, powered by $BB. We‚Äôre driving down the street and pass a $GME. The kids say they really want to go there to build a new PC. Finally, we pulled into the parking lot of $AMC. As were are walking into the theater, I get a call on $APPL implant through the $NOK 5G network. It‚Äôs a call from u/deepfuckingvalue, and old friend.
I think Tesla is a company has some pretty shitty policies when it comes to things like right to repair and access to service. But I still respect what they're doing and I know that their end game is not selling cars but moving to cars as a service. I respect that, I think it'll be good for the world and good for most people. I have a lot of respect for Musk too, he does what he thinks is best, haters be damned. He's had a lot of success in his life because of it.

I swear Elon has a dual personality. He still wants to be the average common man even while he screws his employees, has his cars made by slave labor, and refuses Tesla buyers from purchasing car parts.
Yes there will, but they'll lose. Tesla is a meme even among Hedges. No one wants Bezos as the wealthiest putz in the world and deep down inside they love seeing Elon win. Tesla has many, many quiet defenders.

Honestly fuck Elon, I'm happy he helped some peoples stocks though.   And his game is being relatable to internet-denizens.  After the "pedo guy" incident he smoked weed with Joe Rogan, changed his twitter pfp to an anime picture, and then appeared on Rick and Morty.  He knows how to play these peopleYeah in this Cyberpunk-esque world we live in, the CEO of Tesla is so totally a street punk lmao jeeeeeez
Elon is currently playing Cyberpunk on his Tesla lmao.
Hey Papa Elon, if you're listening:I (and countless others) would have 100% bought Tesla shares and/or vehicles with this money. Robinhood and others have stolen from us. They've stolen from you. Join us in this fight. All we need is a tweet calling out this blatant illegal market manipulation and (cleverly, to avoid SEC retaliation) encourage the people to hold.
Just to be clear, you're pricing Lucid at the Ludicrous Valuation of Tesla?
Just sold 93k of Tesla. Moving it all to GME. Let‚Äôs go!!!
Robinhood is preventing me from buying a Tesla with my tendies. Get Papa Elon on the phone.
This will probably get buried but here goes:Dear Robinhood,I believe that today's action against the people will hurt you and your masters greatly. You have exposed yourself as a company whose actions are immoral and probably illegal. I know that many users, like myself, are in the process of moving their assets to a platform that truly democratizes finance. Ultimately, this move will cause you great financial damage, more so than it would have if you would have just let things play out. Right now, our money is slowly seeping out of your pockets to go somewhere else, limiting your business and funds. And guess what? that money is going to be used for the very thing you were trying to prevent - simply buying the stock we wanted to buy in the first place. Whether for fundamentals, or fun, or greed, or because our friend told us about it, or because we read it on some internet page, it didn't matter how or why we choose it. It was our choice.  You took it away. Whether through poor judgement or great judgement. Our choice. Who are you to decide what we do with our money?So now that you have lost our respect, you also lose our money, and when we buy the stocks we want somewhere else, you will lose all your money. Hope now that the world's eyes are open to this incident and how its clearly meant to screw over retail investors and protect your investment bank billionaires that the SEC and government rain down on you with a hammer and stop you from relentlessly shorting stocks and preventing a company from growing if the people believe in it. You guys were probably the same ones that kept tesla stock flat for years and almost bankrupted them at one point and kept us from having clean computer cars faster. Hope you guys file for bankruptcy soon.
which he wouldnt have because he only got to 100bill by his tesla stock going up. His cash on hand wouldnt follow the same trend
The only time I will sell is when I ELON MUSK INVITES ME TO TESLA OWNERSHIP
I keep selling parts of my portfolio and buying more gme. FUCK TESLA FUCK AMDFUCK NIOFUCK BLINKit‚Äôs all going into GME
Daddy Elon! My goal is to turn 1 gme into 1 tesla. Help us!
actually i think we're safe right now  everyone who is still holding will continue to do so üíéüëê&amp#x200Bpick a color for your tesla
which color do you guys want your teslaüíéüëê
Same. Im not even someone hopping on the gme push. But after robinhood wants to try and fuck with everyone who is on the push? I stand with my fellow retards. All my money is being pulled off robinhood. Sold all my tesla today.
Unless its over 100% short interest, it wont be anything like GME. Also, GME was very cheap, which allowed retail to get in easy. Tesla is already high.
I WANT MORE $GMEI FUCKING LOVE THIS STOCK!! EVEN SOLD THEM MY XBOX 360 üëåüçÜüéÆüî•I WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS DIP AND PUT MY 1000% EARNINGS IN TESLABUT IM A FUCKING RETARD A RETARD WITH HANDS MADE OF DIAMONDS üíéüëêüíéüëêüíéüëê
&gtpa Elon is kind of a big deal around here. Please kindly shut the fuck up because YOLOing Tesla calls courtesy of Big Daddy Elon is literally written in crayon in the constitution of this sub.Smells like SUMMER in here.
thats not even enough to buy your wifes boyfriend a tesla way to go
HOLD LIKE YOU HAVE 100 SHARES OF TESLA AND ITS 2012!!
LAWSUITS!!!MUSK AND OTHERS NEEDA BUILD A TRADING APP FOR THE PEOPLE!!! IM INVESTING IN TESLA AND CHAMATH‚ÄôS SPAC. AND RIOT. FUCK THE CRONIES
Pelosi dropping half a million on Tesla options but will ‚Äúreview‚Äù gme trading. Ffs
60 more shares at 153, cashed out my Tesla holdings...let‚Äôs win this! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I mean you do realize that Biden‚Äôs campaign was funded by Wall Street. He received around 75 million from that sector. If you think Biden and the libs are going to help you here - think again. Look at Nancy Pelosi buying Tesla stock after she learns of Biden‚Äôs plans. Cmon - the DC elite are going to protect these Wall Street pricks.
I don't think underpay is the right word, but for people in those positions in other aerospace/tech companies, he is low on the list.[Heres a link discussing it](https://www.geekwire.com/2016/payscale-ratings-rank-spacex-tesla-low-salary-high-meaningfulness/#:~:text=On%20the%20scale%20for%20early,relatively%20low%20on%20PayScale%27s%20list.). From what I've seen people work there to pad their resume and also contribute to advancing the industry.Bezos is a scumbag though. We can both agree on that.
I'm all about this, but $15k/1 trillion market cap won't happen. That would make GameStop's market cap 20% higher than Tesla.
Bought the dip! I want AMC on my Tesla when it hits 30
If RH can remove AAL, they can remove anything. MAYBE TESLA IS TOO HIGH FOR THEM?
News:LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street investors are sitting on estimated year-to-date losses of $70.87 billion on their bets against U.S. companies following massive surges in some of the heavily shorted shares, data from analytics firm Ortex showed on Thursday.Some shares such as in video game retailer GameStop have jumped more than 1,000% in the past week, driven primarily by retail investors trading on online apps and sharing tips on social media messaging boards.Such gains have forced short-sellers to buy back stock to cover potential losses in what is dubbed a short-squeeze. Moves were exacerbated by more retail investors piling into the stock.Ortex data showed that as of Wednesday, there were loss-making short positions on more than 5,000 U.S. firms.Shorting GameStop may have cost $1.03 billion year-to-date, Ortex estimates, while those shorting Bed, Bath &amp Beyond were looking at a $600 million loss.Its short interest data, sourced from submissions by agent lenders, prime brokers, and broker-dealers, showed that around 62 million GameStop shares with a value of $2.2 billion were out on loan as of Wednesday.Tesla topped the list of most shorted names with $47 billion worth of bearish positions, followed by fuel cell maker Plug Power .The trend of retail traders duelling with hedge funds has rippled out into Europe and Asia. Heavily shorted Australian shares Webjet and Tassal Group rose more than 5% on Thursday, bucking falls in the broader index.Retail traders have targeted the most shorted European names including Pearson and Cineworld , although losses are much smaller than in the United States.Ortex data showed Pearson shorts had estimated losses of $208 million this year, followed by Nokia at $205 million.The European estimates are based on securities lending data, and the profit or loss per day which is then summed up.The share trading mania appears to be by no means over, with Credit Suisse analysts attributing it to the liquidity triggered by waves of monetary and fiscal stimulus "which dwarfs anything seen in past recessions""This liquidity will increase further after the next round of government stimulus," they told clients.WSB you have not created a wave you have created a tsunami /salute
hold till 15k, buy a tesla POG
hold amc they offered more shares this morning. tesla did the same thing and a week later mooned once the price settled
Welp. Im down 30% of my account after yesterday.. Just gonna hold bc I know Tesla will give some of my money back.. The movie stock is fine since I got in at $3
Hahah this is highly important to me. I made enough on tesla to dump a bunch in gme
Friday and Monday are the day your golden eggs hatch. This is the TESLA of stocks. Eyes on the price. Diamond üíé Handsss
I‚Äôm convinced Burry is always right and am debating a large yolo on Tesla puts
Hey RH I lost a lot of money on Tesla yesterday, it was a bad trade, since you help customers make sane decisions, can u give me back the money I lost?
Not even tesla had this much reddit traffic, that's how you know this shit is going to the moon and beyond
Yeah who fucking cares I‚Äôll take my $3.03 payout and get chicken nuggets or 0.00000001 shares of Tesla.
You gotta think, when tesla stock skyrocketed like a mf there was no shenanigans going on, but for us peasants they really doing everything to fuck our shit up? Pathetic.
Tesla down 5%, Papa Elon selling Tesla to get in GME??
I‚Äôve got my model Tesla all picked out for once we break $1K. Flyyyyy baybeeeee
Gentlemen, you may mark my words on this. If GME hits 5k I will buy a tesla with a wheelbarrow of cash. And I'll record it for everybody.
It‚Äôs 2030, my children are huddled together for warmth around the fire on our glamping trip. The new genetically engineered forest/carbon harvesting op surrounds us as I come down from the steps on our 2 story Tesla camper. I tell the scary story to my children (whom I‚Äôve all named Tendies) of how a mythical, extinct creature named ‚ÄúHedge Fund‚Äù tried to rob us of our burgeoning wealth. My wife brings me a scotch and we all gaze peacefully at the clear, cloudless sky wondering what global warming must have been like.
100 @ 19.97First generation immigrant who got lucky and bought in early, I'm not fucking selling yet üíéüôåüíéüôåüíéüôå I hope for enough to pay off my parent's house, max out my investment accounts, get an apartment with my sweet girlfriend, pay this stupid income tax and my customized Tesla.
Sold on Robinhood. Bought at dip in Fidelity. The stupid market manipulators just gave these üíéüôå even more shares. Let me know how that works out for you. I'll drive by in my tesla to collect the tears. Already up again today.
CNBC won‚Äôt show the stock ticker but their bottom Byline reads in all caps ‚ÄúGAMESTOP SELL OFF‚Äù while they discuss Tesla stock. Fucking crazy.
Any tesla dealerships accept diamonds as a form of payment?
We need a tweet from the tesla man right now
Was gonna sell my Tesla shares to buy more GME this morning but can‚Äôt.  That would be another $10k worth of GME @ $275 (currently) per share so that‚Äôs about another 36 shares they owe me.
Holding strong with 11,134 shares. Look at this pathetic market manipulation via short ladder attacks. Haha I watched my Tesla stock drop by 50% back in 2014 and I platinum handed that shit out of that for 7 years and TSLA rewarded me handsomely last year. So I sold and put it in GME and I‚Äôm not fucking selling.
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE TO GO TO MARS, THIS IS YOUR GOLDEN TICKET!FAST üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄSLOW üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ (like Tesla this year)DOESN"T MATTER üíéü§öüíéü§öüíéü§ö

I have 1800 in tesla, should I close outta that and add it to gme?
I KNOW YOU ARE TEMPTED TO SELL TO BUY A TESLA, BUT YOU WILL FUCKING REGRET IT BECAUSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BUY A LAMBORGHINI IF YOU HOLD!!!!!!!!!! FUCKING HOLD. THEY ARE MUCH MORE SCARED THAN US !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tesla will use Nokia phone instead of hammer in next demonstration.
Is this how this sub was when Tesla did it‚Äôs epic run? I understand why Wall Street does cocaine now
if GME has ONE shareholder, then I look forward to visiting your high end entertainment retail establishment  will you offer EV charging stations for my Tesla?
Tesla
Literally the first time I saw this sub come across my feed, it was of some guy in a Tesla eating chicken tenders on a clip-on steering wheel tray talking about "going to the moon, boys!", and I can't even begin to explain how simultaneously confused and intrigued I was. I initially thought it was a joke. Now me and my count-em-on-one-hand shares are here, confused but happy about it and not selling until Melvin cries, even if we lose out in the end. Fuck it, I love gaming and...gah I guess I just...like the stock? Little bitty diamond  pinky finger out üíé
 Gonna buy a Tesla with these gains!! Also change my kids futures and pay my mortgage.Thank you WSB, DFV, Chamath and Elon!!Thank you my Reddit brothers for keeping me sane and üíé‚úã
The year is 2024:&gt I get in my Tesla and set auto pilot to my nearest GameStop. PS5 is *finally* back in stock.  I pick out about 10 games and a few extra controllers, and then go to the PC building station.  The GameStop is reminiscent of the extinct Apple store. I put together a rig that would get me a ton of karma on /r/battlestations and walk over to the counter. &gt The cashier rings up the transaction, ‚Äúhow will you be paying today sir?‚Äù I don‚Äôt have any fiat so I hook up my neuralink to the cashier‚Äôs and telepathically transfer the whole purchase price (0.87 puppy coins). ‚ÄúThanks and have a wonderful day,‚Äù the cashier remarks. As I turn around to leave, he notices my $GME tattoo. He says, ‚Äúand thank you for saving us from the dark side. I can't believe how evil I had become.‚Äù I reply, ‚Äúno problem kid. Next time though don‚Äôt be so greedy so you don‚Äôt lose everything. Glad to see you‚Äôve changed your ways. Have a good day, Andrew Left.‚Äù&gt I hop back in the Tesla. I swipe over to my integrated Robinhood app, balance is up 69420% overall. Not a bad day to own 35 shares of GME. Tweet at Ryan Cohen - ‚Äúthanks man‚Äù. He responds with a üöÄ only.&gt I pick up my son and his friend X √Ü A-12 from school. They‚Äôre pumped about the PS5. We pick up some tendies on the way home. The kids run inside and my wife Mia Khalifa comes out and gives me a big kiss. Her breasts look astounding today.  I turn on the news and see that Gabe Plotkin is now jackin' it in San Diego.  I donate $5,000 to a local animal shelter.&gt Danny Devito is the President of the United States.**This is the future I want to live in, but it can only happen if you HOLD.** üíéüôåüèªüíé
üôã I was reading up about how car insurance and what kind of Tesla I wanted to buyIts a shame there's no Tesla Roadsters on the market RN
Sold all my shares of Tesla that I cought at 330. Gonna GME YOLO.
Summary: GME the OG meme stock... (ok maybe tesla was). But GME IS THE BATTLE.AMC - great short squeeze potential BB - pure play and fundamentals, good short squeeze especially recentlyNOK - the European GMEBuy hold squeeze collect.This is the fuxking wayyyyy!!!
Guys what if Tesla is down because Tesla investors and/or Elon are/is selling a little bit to buy GME?Also why the fuck are these tv/radio personalities so disgusted with GME‚Äôs success? ‚ÄúThe Reddit crowd‚Äù ‚Äúthe retail frenzy‚Äù like oh my god so patronizing. Suck my c____ you pretentious priccs.
I have sinned and tried to diversify my portfolio thanks to GME calls into Apple and AMD and Tesla because of high earnings, but now I see they have all fallen massively. Now I shall repent for my sins by going full GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
what color Tesla r y‚Äôall getting
I barely have time to do my actual job which pays me actual money. Between watching gamestonk go up, scrolling this retarded wonderland, waxing my wife's boyfriend's Tesla, and my second job behind Wendy's I'm putting in 23 hour days.
I bought 10 bucks in GME. Even if it goes up I‚Äôm basically making like 50 cents in profit. I‚Äôm holding even if it tanks. üíéüôè I know 10 bucks isn‚Äôt much but at this point I‚Äôm in just to see DSV make enough money to get a custom Tesla with some endangered animal as the interior leather.
Planning to sell a little Tesla so I can double my GME position.
Traded away half of my Tesla stock for GME yesterday , TODAY IM GOIN ALL IN
ALGOS AND MM‚Äôs TRYING THEIR BEST TO FUCK US. Tech (minus Tesla) crushes it and now it‚Äôs time to ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô? Fuck you assholes$GME AND $AMC TO THE üåô
This trade is dedicated to all the hedge funds that tried to make sure we'd never amount to nothin'To all the media that put out hit pieces in front of the trades we was hustlin onCalled the SEC on us when we was just tryin to make some tendies to feed our wive's boyfriendAnd to all the autists in the struggleIt was all a dream we used to read Gamestop magazine. Michael Burry and DFV up in the limousine.Hangin pictures on the wall every afternoon the market halts no more strikes for our calls.We let our trades rock til the price dropsDiamond hands never sell cause we like our tendies hotWay back when we had Tesla stocks to the maxwith AMD to matchRemember MU the high of highs you never thought that retards would take it this farNow we in the limelight cause we bought up all the strikesTime to get paid blow up like the world trade Born beginner the opposite of a winnerRemember when we used to eat loss porn for dinnerPeace to DFV, Chamath P, and Papa EWe blowin up like you thought we wouldPeep the reddit same sub it's all good And if you don't know now you know retard
I guess Melvin moved over into Tesla or something. It's lost about $80/share in the last day.Record earnings and missed EPS got the "experts" dumping on Tesla.It's a buying opportunity for me. Tesla won't fail. Very long.
Selling all my Tesla shares to load up more GME once the market opens. To infinity and beyond üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
#these boomers and hedge funds are selling things like Tesla and NIO to get enough to spread for the LOSS they are about to cop on GME. YOU. MUST. STAY. STRONGPLTR-BB-GMEDid someone say reddit partnered with E Ther? Might long. Get on Perth property in WA my fellow friends!!
Selling all my Tesla for GME, will RH let me do this soon as the market opens?
Glad I didn‚Äôt buy those 1/29 $1000 tesla calls
Tesla calls fucked me, all I wanted was money to buy GME üò≠
Selling $106k of tesla and hoping I don't get reamed in the process. Putting it back into GME. debating splitting some off into amc. Restructured my other investments tonight to take on more risk. I just like the stocks.
I guess the next move is Tesla after all of us autists place orders with our GME gains. Gonna get the wife a model 3 so she can be zero emission when going to her boyfriends house
Tesla will use NOKIA 3310 battery for the cyber truck
Did someone say positions of ban?http://imgur.com/a/iY1ECwADaddy needs a second tesla let's get it boys.
In 2018 I bought 5 shares of Tesla on Robinhood. I then forgot about it and literally never opened the app again until a couple hours ago. Shocked to see I'm up over 1000%.After reading up on GME over the past two hours, I'm sold. Tomorrow at open I'm selling all my TSLA, and buying all the GME I can, and will hold to $1000+.üíéüëê are easy to have, just be a retard like me and forget you own the stock for 2 years.https://imgur.com/a/VCQ9zHs
Isn't it cool how Burry is short Tesla and Long Gamestop. And Musk's tweet literally awarded Burry...
Always early majority, never early adopter or innovator. Got in at Tesla for 100% gain, Aapl for 80% gain, and here I am again at GME for these pussy gains. I was kicking myself for not listening to WSB the first time, and here we go again my dumbass ignoring GME. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.FOMO
Tesla fucked my calls, so I‚Äôm selling at open and hoping to have enough left to buy GME shares. Elon I‚Äôll be back soon GME is my main bitch now
one tesla per share
How much should I invest in AMC  or NOK or others to buy a $30k tesla tmrw ü§î
For those of you that will make hundreds of thousands of $$$, after you have paid off medical bills, student debt, helped out your families, donated to charities etc, there is only one car to buy, no not a Lambo, but a Tesla Model S Plaid+ Edition. Take a look. Fastest production car ever and you can play CyberPunk 2077 on it.

Of course Elon tweeted he knows we are all about to be Tesla owners
Damn it‚Äôs crazy I haven‚Äôt seen one post about apple Facebook and Tesla earnings.
Alright. I'm in.&amp#x200BI put 100$ in Gamestonk, $45 in AMC, I skipped Nokia so I hope I didn't miss out, and I did 150 bucks total so I put $5 dollars into a fraction of a fraction of Tesla just because I missed out on their last big gains and I'm mad about that. Wish me luck.
Preordering my tesla when I hit 250k.Up 15k yesterday alone.Lets go AMC.
My personal experience:First, I have no shares in $GME. I read a story several days ago from a parody news site saying $GME was at $6000 because Sega was bringing the Dreamcast back. For the next few days any mention of $GME, I assumed, was referencing this parody "news."Then today happened, and literally everyone in the waking world was talking about $GME, DFV, and WSB.I've known about WSB for a while but only looked in a couple of times. I don't have money to invest. In fact, I don't have money for several critical things. But I watch and I talk about what I like. I've been praising Tesla since before their IPO, and I'm even stronger on them seeing the direction solar is going. I'm confident when I see something I like.But HOLY SHIT, DFV has titanium balls and diamond fucking hands. He's earned his family financial independence for life and could gain so much more. And in the process he's exposing what the stock market really is, which I also love.So, I joined the community today, with about a million other people. But unlike them, I plan on staying. Using my brain. Learning the ins and outs of this beast and scraping something together. I won't be able to be part of this, but I will be here for what comes next. I think there are a lot of people like me who will do the same. I hope one day to have diamond hands as flawless as DFVs.Good luck for the next week, everyone. I'll be here cheering you on. Hold the fucking line. WE LIKE THE STOCK.
If they crash the market that just means I'll get high value shares at a discounted price and they'll lose even more. I'd love to get some apple, tesla, microsoft, amazon for the cheap ü§£Go for it mother fuckers. I'll take your shares there too
I was explaining to the wifey what a short squeeze is and how I've made enough for poor man tesla model and she said I was interrupting her time with her boyfriend.Anyway, back here with you autistics, GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüåö.
Is Michael Burry still shorting Tesla?
It‚Äôs simple:Take out a huge loan.buy as many Tesla puts at possible.Kidnap Elon musk.Tesla goes to 0, liquidate the holdings. Release Elon, become billionaire.
I want GME to be able to buy Tesla. Then, we get a Model 3 with every PS6 you buy
So $401M in credits and a GAAP income of $270M means a credit-excluded net income of -$131M. For the year, that means net -$859M loss excluding credits.I get that credits are there for a reason and shouldn't be totally disregarded, but isn't anyone at all concerned about their continued inability to sustain themselves without the credits? What happens when other automakers step up and stop buying them and the credits dry out? It's not like Tesla will be able to just price themselves to victory when competition heats up. If anything, margins are going to shrink.
This isn't just money for a house or a Tesla. If I get out of this alive it means paying off my sister's 50K student loans from nursing school. It means fixing up my pop's crumbling house. It means so much more to me than just me. And that's why I'm not. Fucking. Selling. üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üêµ ü§ù üí™
Aight can we make the price 2500 so I can pay my undergrad, med school and get a tesla with gmegang on the plates?
Literally everyone I know is dumping every cent they have into GME tmrw.. 500 before the gamma squeeze is entirely possible tmrw.I'm talking Tesla millionaires going all in at open
APES GRIP STRONG!!!HOLD POSITIONS TILL THE DEATH !!!!GME IS OUR OPONENTS' NUT BAG AND HEART.  SQUEEEEEEEZE LONG AND TIGHT !!!!Later buy Tesla and Teslas (faster than Lambos FYI)
Hmmmm, today at 12:16 PM engaget posts an article on new 2021 Tesla Model S. Whats at the top? An interior shot showing games to include Witcher 3 on the monitor. I see you papa Elon üòò GMEüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Elon tweetin bout Tesla cars coming pre-installed with...get this...[VIDEO GAMES.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354666567884304385)
Someone less retarded than me needs to make a short animation of a Tesla driving onto a SpaceX shuttle landing on GameStop HQ on the moon
It‚Äôs what Elon would want you to do, make sure to buy a Tesla with your gamestonk money
jealous. been into tesla since $229 pre split, wife doesn't want me to sell one for more gme now that it's up to $300. did manage to grab one gme at $88.
what is going to happen to AMC, dips to 8.99 by friday close. my covered call expires worthless for the dum dum who bought, I keep my shares, monday it moons to 100 dollars a share, I sell at the top, I buy a hooker, i buy a tesla
Keep on holding and make sure we close Friday over the highest call option strike price. Gonna be max tendies this week and next. Time to break my daughters piggy bank and fund her college. I think she‚Äôll forgive me when she gets older and gets a Tesla for her 16th bday. TO VALHALLA!!
Self driving will be extremely deflationary. Whose going to buy a car when self driving uber would be cheaper than having a paper weight in your garage 95% of the time. Instead you can split tge cost of ownership witheveryone else on the service and save a crap ton of money. Some folks say tesla is now an energy company with battery production and solar, theres an ass ton of competition in that space so who knows if they can win and become the market leader there. Trick is they are priced as if they have already won, so why hold the stock anymore.
If you‚Äôre thinking about engaging in any high risk behaviors in the next few days that involve money, reconsider and just put it into GME. I am a poor autistic ski bum and I went to the casino tonight to turn the $400 in my wallet into more money to put into GME and ended up losing $850 because the atm sucked me in. I feel even more autistic then all the retards on this page. If I had just invested that money into GME it would have made me at minimum 3x my investment at the current GME price. Possibly even 15x more since GME is going to $5,000. Buy GME and don‚Äôt make dumb decisions like me. GME will soon overtake Tesla and it will feel glorious. All hail GME üôåüöÄüöÄüöÄ
* Portnoy and his army of degenerate sports gamblers* Elon and the cult of tesla* Donnie Jr and the Magatardsholy shit who else coming for the ride this is insane üòÇüòÇ
I can't stop thinking about how the ability to own a stock just because 'I like it' undermines the  essence of capitalism. The whole 'fundamentals' argument is bullshit. You don't own tesla because the fundamentals are sound, but because elon musk is eccentric and we need more bozos doing cool shit. I kept playing ali baba for their 'fundamentals'. I got burned a lot. Their books are awe inspiring. They crush amazon in growth and profit margins, 100$ billion in a fucking weekend, but they are only half the value. Even the fucking hedge funds don't touch it l. Why? Because they 'dont like it.' (because it's chinese).
Yea tesla and cr*pto are over. The real move is making a buttload on GME, and then buying blue chips with half the profit and gambling the other half on future short squeezes
Do I sell my 5 tesla shares for more gme?
Me going to pick up my Tesla after buying more stonks
I say...EVERY one of us buys a Goddam Tesla after this. Lmao.To THE MOONüåö üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ BROTHERS!!!!!! Yolo ü§≤üíé
Im buying a TESLA, and im also going to buy TSLA with all these tendies!
I sincerely doubt that. In terms of the market this is a drop in the ocean. Yeah there'd be some anger and blow back and maybe even a few lawsuits but I don't think the market would crash over GME shenanigans. Now if they haunted Tesla, GME, palantir, AMC, etc basically every extremely high delta meme stock out there - that might cause a pull out and a crash.
I like that he did that.I like that we helped elon w/tesla.I like that elon helped us with his tweet.I like gme.I like amc.I like bb.But most of all, I like the $guillotine.
Gamestop bout to be more valuable than tesla for a day lmao
[Fox business ](https://twitter.com/cgasparino/status/1354571801767116801?s=21) says Melvin has massively de-levered and is considering liquidation but trying to weather the storm.  ZH says 120% of float still short.  Other players have stepped in clearly.  This happened with Tesla, and you know how that turned out.  It‚Äôs like short whack a mole on an escalator up lol.
i want to see them destroyed. like those fuckers that buy puts on tesla
My buddy who thinks he knows the stock market well after garnering $1500 from Tesla thinks I should sell my GME shares. He doesn't understand the power we hold. I may have lost some money today but I won't back down. I'm here for the ride to THE MOON!

Can't wait to buy that new Tesla with my $GME profits
All we need is Elon to tweet that you can get games in your tesla through gme. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354618504532684802?s=210-60 in two seconds sounds as fun as this gme ride.
I thought the same with TESLA and sat out. not this time.
honestly when all this is done and over with imma put my money into tesla since papa musk has supported all of us through this battle
You choose what color Tesla you want yet?
Tesla model S Plaid anyone? Quickest car in the world for $120k
On that note, Tesla had a very interesting earnings call today, and I thought Elon made a compelling case for their valuation. Despite the impressive run-up the stock has had, the market might still be discounting the impact and value of full self-driving.
Amc, and Gme, BB and Nok, Naked and Tesla may take us to tendie town
Tesla dude. Elon would be disappointed.
I got my BB $12 3/19 calls , bought over 100 amc today , and still got my 20 tesla before the split last year. Holding till the moon boys, no matter what happens tomorrow hold strong üöÄüíéüôåüèª
Elon, I know you're here!  How about hirin(G ME) to work at Tesla as a software developer:My experience: I've never bought puts on Tesla, only calls.
I'm with you. I saved 10k from my first job and started to invest it. Got pretty lucky that I got onboard with Tesla and AMD and some others before they blew up and tripled that in 2020. This wave convinced me to go all out, not because I'm chasing some fad or some meme (like boomer media is trying to say we're doing), but because I believe in the bet and more importantly i believe in the fucking math. I'll hold all day, erryday until the math equation balances. If a few butthurt Hedge defame me as they burn to the ground, so be it.
Sold most of my stocks (still have on Palantir, Nio,Tesla and Disney) to buy GME before close and got a small amount on Nokia and BB just in case they go nuts aswell. I know im late to the GME party but Im holding this mfker no matter what.
https://www.fool.ca/2021/01/27/dont-blame-reddit-users-blackberry-tsxbb-stock-is-still-worth-buying/amp/Buy BB and Tesla as well.
20 tsla, 31 gme, 90 bb. Got rid of my cr ypto but that takes a few days to transfer so I can't play with it.Riding the wave until GME is more valued than Tesla at the minimum.üíéüëêüíéüëêüíéüëê
This is more exciting than the day I created Tesla.
Exactly why elon should help us, thats like 2 million tesla sales if we win
Melvin tried to bankrupt Tesla years ago let‚Äôs bankrupt them for Elon ! We can do it !
We went from making tesla memes about riding the tesla and stimmy wave in 2020 and now we're bankrupting hedge funds. goddamit, I'm so happy I was along for this ride you glorious autists.
I sold my Tesla stock , and bought 2K GME at the top of the hill today. I got Elon fuel in my GME rocket ship to outerspace.
Elon is with us GAMESTONK! https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354609515564560392If you didn‚Äôt know Melvin capital tried to destroy Tesla!
Tesla earnings fucked me
Same. 36 year old engineer here. Turned $100k into $370k via Tesla. Then $370k to $3.8M with GME. Still holding.
If Tesla can get back up to 880 that would be fantastic
[I‚Äôm selling the rest of my Tesla shares and putting it in GME BECAUSE I LOVE THE COMPANY](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x8dHNU1jnXc#)Plus I‚Äôll just buy way more Tesla shares later
Unless Tesla perfects self driving there is no way to justify the current valuation. A ludicrous valuation built on shit financials and hopes and dreams.
I really thought that we got shut down for good. I thought the men in suits were doing everything they can do, even go as far as take our freedom of speech. Which they are trying to do. I was mad, I saw the share price go down and I panicked a little. Then I realized something. I have the power. The shares that I own hold the power to wipe those meanies off the face of the planet. I came to the conclusion I‚Äôm not in it for the tendies anymore. I‚Äôm here for the change we are forcing upon Wall Street. I don‚Äôt care if the share price goes to zero, I will hold my shares to the day I die. My shares are ownership. Their shares are not. Their over extension is just an extension of their selfishness. They bet against an American business, I bet on an American business. The stage is set for the people to wipe their crusty old boomer ways off the face of the planet. At this point, they are just impeding progress for the future. They shorted Tesla, a company spearheading the future of transportation and clean energy. They short companies that have disruptive technology. They try and control the rate of change, the change the people want and need. When we act out against them they play the victim card. Enough is enough, we have them pinned up against the wall. It‚Äôs time to let them know whose in charge now. Let‚Äôs use this as an example of what a bunch of degenerates can do. I like the stock. I ain‚Äôt selling. Screw the men in suits.
Same I‚Äôm selling my NOK, AMC and TESLA
Fuck the Lambo. Get a Tesla.  Or 10.
I can't tell you how to spend your money, but I dumped Tesla for GME
HONESTLY FUCK IT SELLING MY ONE TESLA AND SSOME NIO AND BUYING GME BOY'S TAKE ME TO 1000üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
I don‚Äôt know what to say really. 12 Hours until the biggest battle of our trading lives. All comes down to tomorrow. Either we heal, as a team, or we are going to crumble. Share by share, dollar by dollar, until we‚Äôre finished. We are in it right now. And we can get the shit kicked out of us, or we can fight back. One trade at a time. Now I can‚Äôt do it for you. I‚Äôm too poor. I look around and I see all these autist, and I think, I made every wrong move a trader can make, I said Tesla can‚Äôt go any higher, believe it or not, that AMD was going out of business, and lately I sold GME at $30. When you get poor in trading, things get taken from you, you know but that‚Äôs trading. But you only learn that when you start losing trades. You find out that trading is a game of shares. The margin for error is so small, I mean one hour to early or too late and you miss it, one second to fast or too slow and you don‚Äôt quite hit it. The shares we need are everywhere around us. They are in every day, every minute, every second of trading. On this sub-Reddit we fight for those shares. On this sub-Reddit we tear ourselves and everyone around us to pieces for that share. We claw for that share. Because we know when we add up all those shares, that‚Äôs going to make the fucking difference between taking down these Wall Street assholes and losing. Between living and dying. I‚Äôll tell you this, in any fight it‚Äôs the guy who‚Äôs willing to die who is going to win that share. And I know if I‚Äôm going to have any life anymore it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm still willing to die for that share, because that‚Äôs what living is. The ten shares in front of your face. Now I can‚Äôt make you do it, you‚Äôve got to look at the autist next to you, look into his eyes. Now I think you are going to see a guy who willing to give it everything for that share with you. You‚Äôre going to see a guy who‚Äôs willing to sacrifice themself for this sub-Reddit because he knows when it comes down to it you‚Äôre going to do the same for him. Either we get ready now, as a team, or we die as individuals. That‚Äôs trading guys. That‚Äôs all it is.Now what are you gonna do?
Tomorrow is going to be a crazy day. I hope that Tesla recovers from its garbage earnings and that GME can hold steady or climb.
The value of GameStop is not measurable as anything tangible that the hedge funds keep trying to argue. Everyone knows the name GameStop now and it‚Äôs gotten more recognition in this 2 week run up than possibly since it started operating. It‚Äôs going to be a household name for gaming, like when you hear Amazon or Tesla. That‚Äôs why I think, after the actual squeeze happens, GME is still going to be trading much much higher than ‚Äú$20‚Äù.
Elon to sell off Tesla to buy more GME
If you had Tesla calls for earnings you‚Äôre fuckedIt‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm fucked
He said "But Tesla is exciting!" Great fundamental evaluation Scott. Impressive.
HOLD THE LINE. BUY MORE GME. LIQUIDATE EVERYTHING EXCEPT PALANTIR,TESLA,AMC AND BUY MORE GME.INFINITE SHORT SQUEEZE GANG RISE UP!!!!
It was never tesla that made Elon a trillionaire.It was putting $20 billion into a yolo 360 no scope big brain play to bankrupt multiple brokerages and hedgefunds
And he should. They tried to fuck him on Tesla and he beat them, now he should rip their fucking eyes out for it! Cold... cold, Revenge
Bb all day and throwing more in Tesla hopefully it dips some more ...
The people I work with are a bunch of old guys talking about selling covered calls on tesla smh
Don‚Äôt worry!! All the big hitters are down after hours tonight. Tesla Amazon Apple Google. Don‚Äôt worry they will all go back up. Stonks always go up. Especially GME GME GME GME. HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD!!!!!
Unemployed, in debt, and buys a brand new tesla? No offense but this is how poor people stay poor. 100k or whatever you have left is not as much as you think. And what do you mean 10k? Are you saying most of this is still in the market and could be worth half as much by open tomorrow?
The fact that he attempted to with a straight face say that Tesla is not overvalued while decrying these valuations was perhaps the peak of hypocrisy. The only reason any stock trades at over a hundred times earnings is market sentiment, not reasonable growth projections. Anyone claiming otherwise is a shill or an idiot.
My favorite thing about all of this is that WE have become those shitty investment ads. I saw one that said "reddit chose gamestop and tesla, click to see which stock is next"
Guys please don't sell at $1k. Please. I need a Tesla
I am predicting Musk gives a shout out to WSB and GME today on the Tesla conference call :)
I‚Äôm holding until I can whip my Tesla üöÄüöÄüöÄ back and forth between Mars  üíéüôåüèº
It‚Äôs crazy how this thread should be filled with Apple or Tesla earnings yet here we are. This shit is wild
What colour Tesla has everyone ordered?
I like the stock now and I will like it even more in my Tesla on Pluto üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
More GME, its the next Tesla. Its not just a retail company, its a sector ETF. The sector of red rockets üöÄüöÄüöÄ and green pockets ü§ëü§ë
BUT THE FUNDEMENTIALS. IS TESLA WORTH ITS POSITION?
Wait, you're unemployed but you're buying a Tesla? This is the dumbest shit I've ever read.
I love all you maniacs so much!!! I sold all my tesla and bought in to GME yesterday at $88. Everyone told me I was crazy, now I tell them to suck my nuts while they watch my portfolio get greener!
"Who was right on TSLA? Every single retail investor."That's a stretch. Most retail investors bought into the smear campaign when Tesla was tanking. All that shit about Musk's  Tweets, and the SEC investigations, pressure to get him kicked out of the company, and endless attacks across social media predicting Tesla's imminent demise, garbage build quality of the cars, and turning Musk into a villan?  That was ALL coordinated to destroy the brand of the company and put it out of business. Almost everyone I know fell for it, and still fall for it every single day.The amount of manipulation around Tesla eclipsed anything I had ever seen before. Wasn't surprising. A company that threatens legacy auto and legacy energy is going be a prime target for every shithead hedge fund, politician, CEO, etc. who would benefit from that company being put out of business. The negative publicity was so bad it almost became parody. Luckily, Musk / Tesla had enough fans / supporters and people that saw through the bullshit to keep it hanging by a thread until it could get the Model 3 production ramped up, and now it's one of the most valuable companies in the world. Haha.Tesla could have easily been put down like a dog, not because it wasn't viable, but because the coordinated negativity was strong enough to destroy its brand and destroy it's ability to raise capital. It got away by the skin of its teeth, and you can tell how much Musk is enjoying these same people getting destroyed this past month.
Nice. I thought about buying a tesla with my gains but I don't have a garage and live in a sketchy area and my work parking lot is literally a walmart parking lot so I wouldn't feel very safe lol.&amp#x200BInstead, I'm focusing my gains on a house in a less sketchy area
I just got an email from AAA saying the pros and cons of buying an electric vehicle. AKA I'm going to buy a fucking Tesla after all this what a sign
Hey guys I made a post but there so much spam so Ill post it here too  First off, I like this stock and make your own financial decisions. I'm here just to share my experience.I've read articles on short squeeze on Volkwagen and part of the free money TSLA Inclusion of S&ampP 500.**1. If you want to be fully part of the squeeze, you should HOLD until the following week. People will be tempted to sell as soon as it's friday because that's the day but that's only the very beginning of the "End game"**Why?Volkwagen Short Squeeze was triggered and lasted two days. The Short Squeeze is very obvious and can be evaluated based off the VWAP and consistent constant large chunks of volume. We have neither seen any of these signs. Assuming all the options are exercised and shorts are planning to execute on Friday, this violent and volatile price action will go on until the next week.\*\*2. Those institutions and hedge funds shorting? They WILL exercise on Friday but dont count on them doing so until the end of POwer hour (3pm-4pm)?\*\*Dont believe me? Check how Index Funds and MM played the Tesla Inclusion. No suspensions or halts but gigantic sell walls, and FOMO'd a huge bulk of scalpers in the power hour and made them think "hey...maybe index funds already bought TSLA? Maybe...we should sell..omg we're  screwed"TSLA dropped from 685 to 635 in 10 minutes.What happened next? index funds swooped in and bought all the paper hands selling in unprecedented bulk buys, driving the  price all the way to 665-695.Expect similar things about GME on Friday. Shorts will cover.They will wait until the last  opportunity to do so using psychological fear tactics. Expect a gigantic s pike at the wee hours of  Friday.3.  \*\*Hold. Hold. Hold.\*\*Looking at the charts, it's obvious, the MM are adapting to the situation.On Monday, they suspended and halted. This did nothing. So they adapted.  On Tuesday, they suspended/halted AND the shorts doubled down (Melvin's borrow from POint72) to instill fear and get people to sell to drive vicious sell action. People held and bought more, and they realized its futile and prices return to normals yet again.  On Wednesday, we saw a new strategy. They halted (which did nothing), but we  saw a steady stream of attacks from shorting the stock instead of a gigantic price action. This actually had a bit of an effect to a degree as we did not witness any massive spikes throughout the day.Another strategy we are witnessing is the after hour action.  On tuesday, we were blessed with Elon Musk liking the stock and the tesla cult joining in also liking the stock. However, without a catalyst, we are witnessing a stead stream of attacks to drive down prices in the after hours (something we havent seen before), as the same attack was consistent across all tickers: GME, AMC, NOK, BB (all the WSB stocks)This is not coincidence.Solution ?Buy more, hold. Like all the stocks.\*\*TLDR. Hold until Monday. Keep buying. Short Squeeze inc.\*\*This is my personal  opinion, don't treat it as fact, and I'm not a financial advisor so always doing your own research before arriving to any type of conclusion. Also years of experience in the stock market made me realize how scummy people like Shitron, and MMs are at manipulating prices to your advantage. You can go fuck yourselves.I Like Gamestop and Blackberry though.
Love it ! Nothing like a fellow retard getting ahead. Be sure to post a pic of the Tesla you get üåï
GME is up like literal thousands of percents, it's almost as huge as the tesla run. Sure gamestop is likely still going higher, but more are ready for an initial liftoff baby
Anyone see the new Tesla Model S? Just in time ü§£üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Guys, Tesla had earnings today.  No love for the OG meme stock around here.
One thing about this short squeeze really irritates me and other subs couldn't really answer the question. Everyone is talking about things going down on Friday, but both historic short squeezes (VW 2008 and Tesla 2020) occurred on Mondays. How can that be? Why isn't it more likely that the peak will be on Monday as well instead of Friday?  üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Let me be üåà for a secondI fucking love EVERY! SINGLE! ONE! OF YOU!I started trading along side you crazy autistic fucks last summer and rode the Tesla wave and was a paper handed bitch through every one of my calls. In fact, I requested numerous times for that to be my tag.Today I am sitting on a 3k% profit on the week, shares I am never letting go, options averaged to +9k%, holding on just as tight.Through all the red days and weeks I saw, coming into this sub made losing much less painful. You guys are something else.WE WILL FUCKING HOLD THE LINE AND TAKE FLIGHT THROUGH THE FUCKING GALAXY. üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ
My Tesla license plate gonna be GME THX
Got some SNDL, it's. 61 cents so the return would be life changing,  if it goes up I could buy a yacht for my tendies üêîHolding:TESLA, AMC, and Gamestop ü™®If Gamestop goes up I'll buy a pool for all the tears of the billionaires that are losing everything lol
NAKD is either gonna buy me a Tesla or a sandwich
LET'S PUT BB AND NOKIA ON THE MOON BEFORE ELON PUTS A TESLA THERE
I wanna turn this $100 into $50K to buy a Tesla in like a week, help a brother out
Heyyyyyyy NEWS NEWS Reuters just reported ‚ÄúTesla Inc's fourth-quarter profit fell short of Wall Street expectations and the company on Wednesday did not provide a clear 2021 vehicle delivery target, sending shares down 5.7% in extended trade.‚Äù We will be getting more investors moving here!!!!

GME = Tesla ALL these new bot stocks = NKLA
Why is Tesla plummeting?
we decide how much money a company is worth by analyzing the numbers fuck retail investors they have no clue. free market btw getting judged by buying decisions. if i believe in a company like tesla and their future let me believe it that's non of your business.
"mr smith, you go by the name *eatmyshitcovereddick69* on Reddit, am I correct?""Yes.""And on January 26th you commented that your *wife's* boyfriend is going to '*cum so hard in her after you buy him the tesla he's always wanted*'?""Sounds accurate"
So TD is the firm who fucked up and loaned too many shares out, why else would there care about volatility like this but Tesla can go from $100 - $3000??Just a guess, this is not financial advice.
Exactly. Pelosi buying a bunch of Tesla stock or Ackman going on CNBC talking about "hell is coming" after he took a huge short position. Fuck him and fuck the SEC if they try to stop WSB.WE LIKE THE STOCK!
Tesla and several others price just dropped at the same time that AH drop in gme.Not coincidence
$347.23ELON IS QUITTING TESLA AND STARTING TO WORK AT GAMESTOP
I haven‚Äôt looked into NOK and BB is different likely similar to tesla in the sense investors are jumping on the Amazon deal bandwagon to the moon can‚Äôt go tits up approach
Historic moment - We like this stock! We choose to invest in companies we believe in as a value store!We are at a historic moment in time a paradigm shift in investments.  This is the time when the retailers get to decide the fate of a company.  Previously it was the hedge funds.  Now the wealth gets transferred from Wall Street to the retail we gain more power to decide the fate of a company.We like this stock!  When you hear that phrase, remember the meaning behind it.  Tesla became a store of value to protect against inflation similar to gold.  Why?  Because we like Elon Musk!  Who‚Äôs to say some greedy Wall Street funds are right in being the demise of a good company and forcing them to bankruptcy?  We like GameStop!  Who‚Äôs to say GameStop can‚Äôt become a value store similar to Tesla regardless of their business model?Why can‚Äôt we chose any stock to use as a value store?  We can and we will if enough go along with it. GameStop is the revolutionary war against the greedy shorts.  This is just the beginning!  This isn‚Äôt about making a quick buck and selling, all who hold their funds in the stock create a value store similar to Tesla.  We don‚Äôt need the financials or papers or knowledge to create our value store and put our money where we choose!You‚Äôll have regulators push and say this isn‚Äôt right and we‚Äôre in the wrong because we like this stock.  The truth is maybe we do like this stock to store our wealth as a value store against inflation! The squeeze hasn‚Äôt even started it was practically illegal on the market makers to issue more stocks in shorts than existence.  We are not in the wrong, we‚Äôre all in the right!  I like this stock will be here to defend companies we like against the shorts!!!Let the entire market go down except for the stocks we chose as a value store to protect us against inflation caused by the administration‚Äôs policies.
Thanks to gme I'm not even gonna feel the green dildo from tesla earnings
Rookie here and jus started following this sub like 2 days ago. Doing stonks bout 2 weeks. l Just SOLD.......... tesla to buy 3.more shares of GME. All I could do. LETS FUCKING GO TO THE MOOOON!!!!!

Like the fundamentals cathie told them about for tesla so they could bring her back to laugh at her?OK... Funny how you only want all of the proof now would it's a retail Trader. Last I checked I didn't need to write a white paper to go long
Once in a lifetime happens all the time.Look at Amazon, Tesla, etc.
Elon takes controlling interest in Gamestock, forces shorts to cover at 5000, uses gamestock locations as Tesla and game showrooms with refueling stations
You missed out on Amazon. You missed out on Tesla. Netflix. But not this. This is a Rocket üöÄ for the working man.

Looking for moon property. Even until yesterday I thought this was crazy and $160 was tops. I‚Äôm so fucking stupid. Sold some Tesla, got 8 shares of GME @ $330. Blastoff bitches
Shorts caused Tesla to go up into the 800s post split. There's plenty of room. GME is very small, and fundamentally as a business, with the right pivots, they could easily be bigger than a company like Best Buy (which also fought Amazon years ago in the face of bankruptcy). Also, we have RYAN FUCKIN COHEN üíéüëêüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Tesla went to a thousand, did a 5:1 stock split, then rocketed to over 800 again. And the media wants me to think Reddit is the problem.
Been holding BB for months now, it actually has massive upside, software being used with Amazon and Tesla! Also bought some amc and nok to help support this rebellion üëçüèª
Good lord that reporter genuinely does not understand what the fuck is going on right now in the stock.  When Chamath mentioned Tesla and he just froze up it was fucking hilarious
This subreddit is actually socialist because it‚Äôs redistributing wealth from Wall Street (hedge fund firms) to Main Street (Tesla stock and bitcoins)
Over a 5 year period, a $40k Tesla costs less than a $30k Toyota.
I will never forget selling Tesla based on how bullish this sub was lol.
I've avoided WSB for so long, because I just usually to throw everything into an index or Tesla.Not today. Today, GME. Tomorrow, who knows. Time to kick 'em in the shorts.
iden admin is "monitoring" GME situation. Pelosi can buy $1M in Tesla options right after Biden announced federal. Fleet will be converted to EV's, but we're not allowed to get in on some action.

HOOOOOLD THE LIIIIINE friday you all will be 100x richer than today just APE BUY APE HOLD APE BUY TESLA

Lol, GME just eclipsed Tesla in my portfolio.
I think it is fascinating all the different moving pieces and the different stakes.I think one of the most interesting things was Elon Musk tweeting.  He knew it would cause upward movement, but even with $0 in GME he stands to make money by possibly killing off the funds that are/were shorting Tesla, maybe forcing them out of their Tesla positions, or perhaps even having them think twice about shorting Tesla again as it has been shown it can quickly spiral out of control.Chamath was also right that the "anonymous WSB" people riding this are not at all misinformed.  They went heavy on this when Cohen came on board well before the giant rise in price.  The internet has provided the necessary information that funds are overexposed and there aren't enough shares to go around.
Did I just liquidate my Apple and Tesla earnings plays to buy more GME stock? You‚Äôre damn fucking right I did.We hold they bleed boys, don‚Äôt give an inch.
Fuck me boys. Sold 195 NIO to buy GME. But not sure I can part with my 10 Tesla. Convince me otherwise. Thinking of pulling the trigger üò≠
ABOUT TO BUY MORE IF YOU PAPERS KEEP SELLING SEENYOU SOON WHILE I'M DRIVING A TESLA AND YOU'RE WALKING
Tesla model GME.  Comes with built in PS6. XBox 1000, and a custom built gaming pc with parts from the new GameStop building station.  Also Tesla should install charging stations outside all GameStop locations.
And he said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt acknowledge the growth potential of Tesla‚Äù when chamath referenced it, like dude u don‚Äôt see the growth potential for GameStop? They go hard on e-commerce they crush with RC‚Äôs chewy experience. Get fucked CNBC, hope someone figures out some dd to bankrupt them as well
if GME hits $1200 / share I will be able to pay off ALL OF MY DEBT / LOANS  if GME hits $2000 / share I will be able to pay off all debts and buy a Tesla Model 3 in cash.  HOLD BRETHEREN, HOLD
GameStop is to video-games what TEsla is to EVs
FUCK IT DUMPING SOME TESLA FOR MORE GME
Sold more tesla to buy 15 more shares. I will reinvest these tendies into tesla for daddy elon but I didn't hear no bell.
TESLA STOCK WAS STRUGGLING AT THIS PRICE POJNT AND NOW IS 5000 (pre 5 - q split)
IF ELON TWEETS TODAY AFTER MARKET CLOSES, IM BUYING A BRAND NEW TESLA IN THE FUTURE FOR THE BOIS
Fuck it, won‚Äôt play Apple and Tesla to be a part of history. All in for shares and a 9k call.
Hey William Galvin I‚Äôm a retard and have no idea what I‚Äôm doing! I‚Äôm so unsophisticated, somebody stop me before I invest in another company and hold my position. They say lighting never strikes twice, yet I‚Äôm up 1,800% in Tesla shares! Please, save me from myself!
Imagine if Tesla made some sort of deal with Gamestop
Chamath , you are truefundamental in market is a joke. How about Tesla ? GME is what we believe and understand .
REMEMBER WHEN WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT TESLA WOULDN'T REACH 420????
ELON MUSK, we need you! I own a Tesla, ordered a cybertruck, and fully support you!! Tweet GAMESTONK for us!!
I'm moving to california with my gains and voting Chamath while I drive around in my new Tesla.
Buy a game from GameStop for $60 and return it for $5. Buy a share of GameStop for $6 and make a Tesla. 2021 baby!
I wish Chamath was informed on the fundamental play of GME. How it's only trading at like 4x revenue in the age when tesla is trading at 47x revenue.How we just hired an e-commerce god as CEO who took Chewy to a billion dollar company. We can transform this company completely and compete with amazon. Gaming is the future. gaming and esports increasing every year.
He‚Äôs wrecking this dude on CNBC. The host‚Äôs logic doesn‚Äôt apply to all stocks. Tesla is a key example of that if you look at their PE Ratio
Chamath roasting this guy. Beautiful point about Tesla. CNBC clown saying that no way GME is worth this much and Chamath is like bro look at Telsa you idiot it's gone 10x in months and you can't actually tell me what it's worth
We should tweet Elon and tell him if he drops a few hundred million in GME now we‚Äôll all buy a Tesla
Chamath x Tesla collab!    He said every hedge fund was wrong with TSLA, than when people innovate, Wall Street push pack!
ARE WE RETARDED? MAYBE. BUT WE'LL BE RETARDED IN OUTER SPACE. I CALL DIBS ON ELONS TESLA ROADSTER THATS FLOATING AROUND UP THERE
I‚Äôm selling my long term holdings in apple and Tesla, MORE BUYING POWER
If my account breaks $40k I‚Äôm buying a Tesla and getting a plate that says ‚ÄúTHX GME‚Äù

Remove 420 limits.  Tesla had a hard wall at 420 because of the meme!!!
Nanci just put her portfolio out there  and said she invested in tesla right after Biden said they are using electric cars for Government vehicles. Crazy they can do something like that. But if we talk about a stock that we love it‚Äôs not right. Wtf To the moon üåèüöÄüöÄüöÄ boiiiss
Elon should buy GameStop and make a Tesla video game console
Just heard that GameStop founder, John Gamestopenopolis, is selling the company to Tesla
Like several different singles of random stocks, 1 of Tesla, 1 of apple, 1 of twitter, 1 of our local radio station, etc but 0 of GME and it was $85/share when I bought mine yesterday morning!
Elon knows all these youngster rich people from WSB will buy one Tesla car! He smart, he loyal
Elon also probably knows that how high this stock gets has a direct impact on Tesla sales. I bet over 50% of the people in this sub have a number that "If GME hits $XXXX, I'm buying a Tesla with the profits". And its fucking awesome.
This poorboy can afford a gaming PC with his shares. I'm holding though, because I'd rather play from the backseat of a new Tesla while my wife's boyfriend chauffeurs me around
What is going on.......I can't feel my face. Is this real? I will have no debt, I might even have a Tesla
My position in game stock is worth more than my Tesla position.
"GameStop shares have skyrocketed this morning as r/WallStreetBets destroyed Citron Research‚Äôs short position. Now, a tech whale is entering the trade: ARK Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood initiated a GameStop long position with a price target of $4,000.Early last year, Wood was ridiculed for her $4,000 Tesla price target. However, she was vindicated this year when Tesla hit that price target on a split-adjusted basis.Will the same thing happen here with her call on GME? Clearly ARK is betting it will. According to one source, Wood had to be talked out of a $12,000 price target."&amp#x200BNow even institutional investors are realizing the SQUEEZE IS ON.
sold 4 tesla and bought the dip. confidence boys
If I was Elon i'd liquidate the entire Tesla company and buy GME
Hey Siri route me to the nearest Tesla dealership
Guys i just liquidated all of my tesla do i buy another 20 shares?

our boy Elon must be selling off his Tesla stock and tossing into gme
Tesla, apple and pltr calls in the menu for me. Im ok with only light tendies this week.
VW was 1-2 days. But Tesla stayed high so who knows...
Why would tesla split again
Similar vibe to GME basically . We expect normal investors to think it's old news. But we've all been YOLO-ing money at what certainly feels like a new long-term trend, electric cars. And if you follow their supply chain you realize there's a lot of patents held by Blackberry, especially for the comms stuff and software. It's more off-the-shelf than whatever Elon has cooked up for Tesla, but he's not sharing.Can BB transition into a good middleware dealer for the next big industry? We reckon.
GME right now is May 2020 TESLA but cheaper. Much cheaper. How can you NOT buy into it.
Disney, Apple, Tesla leaps are free money
I‚Äôve also seen plenty of people who say ‚Äústo nks only go up‚Äù and believe Tesla rising from $300 to $3000 within 12 months is just the beginning and anyone who doesn‚Äôt own a share is forsaken. Is that any different than cultists or MLM? If you are doing a serious consideration of whether or not to get into crypto, I‚Äôd recommend reading up on Ethereum and smart contracts - it‚Äôs a cryptocurrency with a much more expanded value proposition than Bitcoin. Note I didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs better, but has additional utility that Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt. Personally I am bullish on the crypto space overall and my only advice to anyone planning to buy now or soon is, the price is extremely high right now, crypto is extremely volatile and don‚Äôt invest any money you can‚Äôt afford to lose. Any money put in at current prices should be seen as a highly speculative purchase, one where if you lost every dollar you‚Äôd be mad but not be losing sleep.
On Dec 22, she bought these calls at 230 each or approximately exactly $575,000 trade (25 x 100 x 230).  TSLA was trading @ 630 that day, or in the money of $130, so a $100 time value premium.She has  already almost doubled her money as it is now worth $420.My guess is that she knows that she will give Tesla EV credits again for all their cars.Boom.
I‚Äôm here to let all you retards know, ms Nancy pelosi has purchased 500k-1mil worth of Tesla calls, if this doesn‚Äôt give you enough conviction I don‚Äôt know what will
Not a bad bet.  The real value in Tesla is batteries if people are still unaware.  They can sell sub 500k vehicles every year, but their battery tech is the true reason why the stock price will never come down.  Who else is gonna supply every house with their forced solar power batteries?
Us profiting off of Tesla regulatory credits is the same as boomers profiting off Lockheed-Martin and other defense contractors getting contracts in the 90s. There really is nothing new under the sun
*Laughs in Tesla from 2018*
Capitol building and Washington monument to be covered in Tesla roofs by 2022, ‚ÄúTSLA 4000‚Äù to be added to American flag
Federal tax credits expired for Tesla long ago.The only remaining credits given to Tesla are state-level, not federal-level.Tesla also is $0 in debt to the US government, which isn't true of many other US automakers.
She is a political leaders and has big pull, her having a financial stake in tesla most likely means she sees what is coming down the pipeline.
It's neither good or bad. But it is stupid that she decides on giving money/credits to companies like Tesla.
California to ban roofs that aren‚Äôt Tesla roofs 2025
It‚Äôs even more sketchy when Tesla is only profitable because of billions in regulatory credits passed by Congress
Nancy pelosi bought Tesla calls lmfao
Tesla was ok, because the media was pumping it and the banks were behind it. GME is a target now, because they don't have their blessing. The kinds of misinformation and shilling for Tesla on YouTube in the past year has been unprecedented. The SEC never gave a shit. But if powerful people don't want GME to go up, they will attack us.We are just investors with a solid value thesis. They can disagree with us, but we are not spreading misinformation at all.
Your honor, according to the precedent set in the case of Tesla v. Gay Bears, bears are fuk.
All these comments trying to apply logic to Tesla‚Äôs value as if Elon Musk couldn‚Äôt come out at any second and go ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna merge starlink (or space X, or both) to Tesla under one umbrella‚Äù and the stock would shoot wouldn‚Äôt over 1000. Everyone can hate but Nancy knows they‚Äôre gonna be giving new green credits allowing Tesla to provide the most affordable EV car to the public creating more hype and consumer craze. Nancy Pelosi is gonna flex on everyone with her sick gains and these comments won‚Äôt age well.
I always sort WSB by new and very few other than obvious stocks like Tesla, GME, PLTR or BB have sold me, I literally just brought three shares, üöÄüöÄüöÄEdit: historic stats show given enough time, this stock never lost value. God tier find
About to graduate with a finance degree in the South. Stated investing in 2019 because I was taking classes that showed me that the only way to really accumulate wealth passively was to invest in stocks. School also showed me that it wasn't as much of a gamble as I had previously thought. Basically all business school was for me was professors saying, "yeah, you have to buy stocks"  I remember specifically my Bus. Law professor telling the whole class to tell our parents to put their life savings into Tesla, at the time it was @300 pre split. TLDR of business school, buy stocks or join the rat race.
Autonomous functionality with their real time processing. Due to BB having the most encrypted OS for said operations, it‚Äôs secure. Not even Tesla is FCC approved for it.
I heard something that makes me think of TSLA. I'm a index fund investor turned here for the ride.  Is this essentially how Tesla got to 800b market cap? The smart money just says fuck it we'll stay short until it drops, then short it more.
I bought 61 GME shares. I did it not because of the memes, but because the stock has become a meme stock. Memestocks seem to do extraordinary well, beyond rational well. I believe amd stock should be around 40-50 because of their lack of moat (no positions), tesla is way overvalued (also no positions) and i believe palantir (no positions) is a hot air balloon with not that exotic tech.  Yet they all skyrocketed because many people believe.Now, GME, it's in a growing market, they have lots of locations (i believe a corona rebound will have people make any excuse to go out of the house), they have a new hot shot manager, AND they've become a memestock.&amp#x200BBoth my rational investor side says invest in this, and my "don't fight market irrationality" side are in agreement for once.
No. Tesla has their own software and data collection infrastructure.
Buy shares, buy options, buy etf with Tesla heavy. It's about to pop like Pelosi's knockers
When I saw people getting excited that interest was costing the shorts ~800 mil per day all I could think was the utterly massive loses that Tesla gave shorts. And those fuckers still short Tesla. The big fish in the stock market might get a little.but hurt when a trade goes wrong but they generally don't care. They will make it up with the next one and continue about their business.
The year is 2024... GameStop has just finalized an all share acquisition of Tesla to further cement their position as the largest corporation in the world. This follows their deals to acquire Apple, Microsoft, Shopify, and Amazon. GME shares have been growing at an average rate of 69% per week over the last 3 years. President Kamala Harris has introduced universal basic income where all citizens receive a $2000 GameStop gift card each month. This has lead analysts to estimate GME may be undervalued at just $420,420.69 per share. A bankruptcy court has taken the unusual step of forcing Andrew Left to work in GameStop customer care to pay off his debts arising from short selling positions he held on to through 2021.Thanks to donations from Reddit users, researchers have been able to cure cancer, autism, and bearitis. Entire 3rd world countries were lifted out of poverty when monetary policy pivoted to focus on buying GME calls. The world has never seen more peace and prosperity.
They listened to me when we bought $NFLX when they still made mailed DVDs. Oh and Tesla at $60 a share and Google when it was under $300 in 2008 I believe. I‚Äôve been a good son to them telling them what will print cash in the long run!
This is the Instant noob detectorWhenever someone says "name of company" + stocks"Whats up with tesla stocks?" "We still buying gme stocks?"

Homeboy lost out on Tesla calls 1/15 and He is only active in this sub and r/Unemployment. I'm not sure if trolling or actually outshining our stupidity.
Don't be a fucking idiot, SEC literally removed Elon from tesla board in 2018 cause he tweeted like a moron.  RC **has** to be safe, that's literally the reason for this whole thing
I dont see why they need to be the same price, we saw a similar thing with tesla and people were buying all the strikes. Buying one specific strike means that if the stock hits that point it gets an extra boost, but literally every call helps as long as its not 1 delta. Also, the lack of liquidity in gne means it is vastly more likely to see this type of squeezeAlso 115s are opening, these are much less likely to go itm and leave retail holding the bag instead of squeezing. Would not suggest those.  Would also not suggest everyone try to buy a single thing because that is market manipulation and we don't need extra crap about that right now.  Shprt and gamma squeezes are going to happen because hedge funds are run by morons, it doesnt require illegal manipulation to case that
If people want to sell GameStop let them do it.People got off the Tesla train early, I did not try to convince them to get back on, I bought their shares. Not everyone gets to go to the Moon, some people stopped off at asteroids. They are floating around somewhere now crying to themselves
Now imagine someone being like " well I was able to pay for brand new Tesla truck thanks to gamestop. " Boomers will be so confused.
I hit 10k on Wednesday. It was the second time (hit it and lost it during the Tesla split), so closing at 18k on Thursday was a big event. Then I hit 65k yesterday and closed at 55k. I don‚Äôt even know what a ‚Äúbig event‚Äù means in this context anymore. All I know is that every I hoped for happened on Friday and everything I‚Äôve been dreaming of is happening Monday. All from my first stimulus check in May. I‚Äôve never had more than $2500 in my checking account at one time and I haven‚Äôt had a savings account for 20 years. What a time to be alive.
I asked this about Tesla 1 year ago. I think shorts lost $28 Billion in 2020 alone. So someone is willing.
Next week‚Äôs earnings is about to be so stacked... if Tim apple and Tesla musk can pull through and destroy earnings, I‚Äôm getting my cyber truck üòÇ the entire market could be so bullish if earnings beat next week. Pray pray prayüôèüôèüôèüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
At this point I have a LOT more confidence that GME will go up from here (even without a short squeeze) than I have that Tesla will. And I‚Äôm bullish on both. Also saying this as someone that originally got in Tesla at sub-$100 levels so very familiar with the play.
2020 the year of Tesla Millionaires2021 the year of GameStop Multi-Millionaires
@Members Were: My morning routine:- Wake up- Coffee- Read the FT, WSJ, NYT papers- Log on to Bloomberg check markets, read news- Watch BBG Surveillance - Buy deep-OTM Tesla Calls and YOLO options
Don't be stupid. Put 80% of your money into something that will surely go up (Tesla) and then use the 20% to go all out on GME shares. If it is expected to rise as high as it is, then 20% should carry you to BIG money. This is a foreign concept here known as "discipline" and it's what allows you to hit big money in 4-5 years.Or be stupid, go all-in on GME, and maybe become a millionaire next week, or lose it all. I am already sure exactly which one you will pick though, so make us proud.
Actual TLDR BB is setup to give every boomer automaker a chance to beat Tesla, Google and Apple when it comes to computer shit in the cars.
Started with NIO, ICLN, PLUG. Rolled it into ARKG and TESLA calls. Then GME shares and weeklies. Still holding GME and ARKG.
I did this too. Fairwell, pennystocks. Hello gme. I‚Äôm keeping my energy stocks tesla plug etc
I've sold almost everything for GME.Sat at 87 Shares, going to sell my remaining 3 Tesla Monday and go all in.This could be the moment my life changes for me and my family.I'm so hard.
Totally agree - set limit orders of numbers you are happy with 420 - 550 - 696.90. Or don't sell at all and hold this badboy for 20 years. I bought 2,500 bucks of tesla in 2015 and i'm now sitting with 60k at the moment, selling hasn't crossed my mind
I ate some vegan food and now have terrible gas and can‚Äôt sleep.

Dream on brother! My PT is whatever is higher than Tesla for the day
Ford isn‚Äôt doing what Tesla did back in 2018 so no
That man is a genius.However, as a side note, I think he is short Tesla lmao
Chamath Palihapitiya (billionaire) can go on CNBC to say ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt sell a share of Tesla‚Äù....but autistic retards supposedly aren‚Äôt allowed to help out their favorite local video game store?
You can delet that third paragraph and just write, Tesla. Can't wait for GME split announcement on Tuesday üöÄüöÄ
I sold my 7 shares of Tesla at 3:42 CT and followed the advice of my fellow autists on WSB, dumped my $6k in proceeds on 97 shares of GME, and made $417 in 18 minutes.
EZ money, I always bet the house on Tesla, and guess what, now I got two ! üè°
Look at how shorters were screwed on Tesla, let‚Äôs do it with GME! Buy and hold!üíéü§≤üíéü§≤
Doesn't matter if you made 100 or 100k, give some gains back to your community. Shelters, Gift cards to kids hospitals for game stop, or donating to an Autism cause of your choosing. Better yet buy yourself a new console from the company that just gave you the cash to do it haha. It's like a Tesla gains bruh buying a Tesla.This is the way.
This beats anyone who did yolos on tesla. Tesla is a good company lots of potential... gme is a shit company... to bet it all on gme and hold it is truly diamond hands.... autism savant.
(M22) I just got another job today. Pays 30% more than my current job. I‚Äôm keeping my current (weekend) job as well. My new job is on call and if I was to get at least 24 hours a week for the rest of the year, I‚Äôll save and invest an additional $3000 per month. I currently have 28,200 right now. If Tesla reaches $1400 by the end of the year, which is 5% increase every month, I‚Äôll have about 90k saved &amp invested by the end of the year.I can‚Äôt stop thinking about money and becoming a millionaire. One day I‚Äôm going to look back at all these comments and relive the journey.
See there is a few key points for everyone to think about:1. Normally when sentiment around here is this bullish and profits have been made on a meme stock, experienced members would remind them to take stuff off the table (not happening much as far as I can tell).2. Lots of Media attention claiming this sub has the power to move markets, even though that has never been the case (and I really doubt it ever will be with retail tbh).3. Gamestop shit is trending on fucking tiktok4. Mrbeast just bought out an entire gamestop to add meme value to this entire farce.Now maybe I'm just salty because I sold early back in September, but this whole shit smells like the biggest pump and dump in history. I really hope some of you take some of your winnings off the table. Don't get me wrong though, I am thinking of going all in next week. This is either going to become the next Tesla, or it will crash and take all of us with it.
Sorry there's no pumping, there's no strategy. In the end, each person makes their own decisions. Gamestop just happens to be tremendously undervalued and the most shorted stock at the same time just like Tesla was. We trust Cohen to know what he's doing just like we trust Elon. Shorts keep pushing the same narrative and looking for excuses or someone to blame. Theyre pointing fingers when they can't even take responsibility for their own trades.
Yeah, who wants tesla model 3 money, I want Mclaren 720S money or death.
Bro thank you for your dd. You give me more conviction for holding gme. I‚Äôm have a large interest in this company because to me it resembles Tesla in 5 ways. Continuous high short interest, cult investors, positioned in an explosive market, top tier management, and the stock‚Äôs high volatility. What is your thoughts on this?
The other difference is that I missed out on Tesla
&gt When was the last time every single call option available for a date expired in the money?Last Thursday or so with GME I think.Might've happened with Tesla too I think
Yes and see his 2018 Tesla fail
Do so at once.  Limit order your Tesla to sell at $800 and then limit buy GME $420.69
Tesla ? Bro... that‚Äôs 2018
today i sold a share of tesla to buy gme on a dip. SHould i just sell the rest of tesla and go all out gme??
He lost his ass in 2018 with Tesla and so yes this is what they do. This is them on defense
i originally had a modest 16 shares of tesla that i planned to hold indefinitely. i made the very tough decision this morning to sell 6 of those shares and put it into gamestop. it was a hard decision, and finally selling those 6 shares made me cringe beyond belief.but you know what? fuck it.i'm selling the other 10 on monday. i'm going all fucking in. you retards better not let me down.
Michael Burry is an actual autistic genius. His word is basically law at this point. He called the 2008 recession, he called the current GME squeeze over a year ago, maybe I‚Äôll hop in with Michael on the Tesla short too.
Bruh Im just tryna get me a tesla
Okay... im gonna sell my tesla shares and jump on this train you are all very convincing.
‚ÄúCult like investors that were in Tesla or Apple‚Äù Yep and yep.... ok?
We've had Tim Apple, Jeff Amazon and Elon Tesla. Now get ready for Ryan Gamestop.
Nahhh bruh, at this point if they tell me Tesla is going to 1k, I'll prolly short it.  They shady af
Trade $20k worth of Tesla for BB?
Yea FOMO is hitting in this will have Tesla level retard strength dip buying
Wait until you turn $3000 into $30,000 in a year with a complete fucking Tesla meme buy (not even an option) You will be blowing money on hookers and coke
This is actually incredible and we haven't even started. This saga is going to continue for weeks/months and as long as we all hold we're gna go down in history bois.When we hit 100 and have more 50%+ days more and more ordinary folk will jump into this stock, similar to how everyone and their dog jumped into tesla. The hedge funds have doubled down their shorts and are royally fucked. We have em by their neck lads and we won't let go.Hold. There'll be dips along the way, add if you can or hold. Do not sell.See you on the moon.
Yeah would suck for gme to end up like tesla
Over 170m cars using QNX.If Tesla ditches their linux os and goes with QNX, I'm gonna have a fuckinf stroke.
Doesn't matter, it might just become just a self fulfilling prophecy.. We'll pile onto the stock in masses in hopes for it to shoot up to infinity, see it snap every circuit breaker there is on the way, all day long, verifying our hopes, and we'll continue to pile onto the stock with a complete disconnect from reality. 100.. 200.. 400.. 800.. 1000! 1200! 1600! 3200! 6400! 12000...Soon overtaking Tesla and Apple, it just keeps going and going, fueled by a frenzy of chasing the infinity squeeze and moron after moron covering their ever increasing shorts. Oh, just a 20% day? Whatever, the numbers are meaningless anyways.
they need to open up calls with higher strikes like 100C or 150C, so we can utilize the infinity call gamma squeeze glitch and turn this into tesla 2.0
I have 1 share of Tesla at $480. Should I trade it in for 56 shares of BB?
Volatility is expected people holding for much longer will know that no matter what these shorts have to cover so they are fucked as long we hold on to these shares they are getting fucked. It‚Äôs pure greed from Melvin shorting at 20. Cohen needs to release a GameStop limited edition Tesla ps5 lol
DFV is quite different....literally everyone and their mother were in on Tesla...that $500 yolo didn't start the trend and brought everyone along...DFV shared this with WSB and literally converted this entire SUB on a fucking obscure stock.
BB the next TeslaüöÄüöÄüöÄ
There is nothing stupider than buying a peak unless it‚Äôs Tesla or anything supported by WSB
Or itll be like tesla and we keep fucking squeezing them til infinity
Mine? Not from Tesla.
hope it becomes like a Tesla situation where the stock just keeps going
what did he say about TSLA?you took too long to answer. i googled it: [https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-michael-burry-enjoy-while-it-lasts/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-michael-burry-enjoy-while-it-lasts/)well, in the last couple weeks he's been right about that.
That's what they said about Volks in 2008. Tesla at current stock price adjusted for if there was no split would be at over $4200 a share. People were making memes about Tesla for $420 and $1000. Then in short order we hit those levels and they weren't such a joke to those who made the epic journey. Astronomical prices sound absurd, until you suddenly find yourself at those levels. This is history in the making
You think tesla gonna go up next week?
&gt So when you compare 2015 to 2020, you could make the observation that net capital is flowing out of Tesla stock ($30 trillion in transactions for 2015 vs. $500 million in transactions for 2020)How could that be considered a capital outflow? That's just a decrease in trading volumeIf market cap = price x outstanding shares, the only way capital can fall is if price falls or shares are bought back
GME is like TSLA. Whoever is bringing up VW is just retarded. Ignore them. Over the course of today, more shorts were introduced. Shorts want in, not out. This is exactly like what Tesla faced
Anyone still remember Tesla
The dude was writing articles, blog posts and made a CNBC appearances in 2013 telling everyone to have 1% of their net worth in Bitcoin having acquired 100,000 BTC himself.  Back in 2013 he was saying Tesla was an investment of a lifetime and what a dumbass Tim Cook was for not trying to acquire Tesla when they were struggling.  Also he has been an advocate of investing in Amazon for a long time, including a presentation in 2015 outlining why Amazon from 2015-2025 would become a 3 trillion dollar company.  Generally, I like to listen to people like this whose fingers have the pulse on technology and innovation (Cathi Wood anyone?).  He's also helped launch of bunch of companies including lead funding for Slack.  But instead of listening dumbasses are going to claim he got lucky of Facebook.&gt Don‚Äôt Be Left Behind (Again) Buy Bitcoin.  In fact, he has around 100,000 of them. (That‚Äôs roughly how many bitcoin Palihapitiya said he controls, and at a cost basis of less than $100. One bitcoin is worth $522 as of this morning.https://www.strictlyvc.com/2014/03/27/chamath-palihapitiya-dont-left-behind-buy-bitcoin/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2013-05-30/bitcoin-the-perfect-schmuck-insurancehttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2013-05-02/apple-bond-issue-steve-jobs-would-ve-bought-teslahttps://www.valuewalk.com/2016/05/chamath-palihapitiya/
Y‚Äôall have ALMOST convinced me to sell out of Tesla. (Emotionally attached) and buy GME... almost.
Nope, by buying an option you are paying for the  ability to buy a stock at an options strike price at some predetermined date in the future. So the Tesla guy bought ridiculously out of the money options, when Tesla was trading at like 100$ pre split. The options market did not price in a move of over 1000% in 1 year so those options he bought for pennies are worth hundreds of dollars.
If WSB pushes $BB it does not push a bullshit company, but a real value play over the next years. This is how Tesla-Stock startet. $BB will fly to triple digits when revenue will grow (an this will happen).
Lucky once? He became a billionaire from Facebook and then dumped a ton of money into Bitcoin, Tesla, Amazon and Slack. Now he's leading the way with SPACs which is revolutionizing the way normies can invest early in companies.He's just been very anti-Trump which has unleashed hordes of trolls across the internet who try to downplay his success.
Let's hope the $60k worth of stocks is worth it boys! Goodbye my Tesla stocks hello GME!
As far as total value increase seen on this sub from an amount like 50,000$, yeah it‚Äôs gonna be hard to beat. Not many people have 50,000$ to yolo into a stock. But the guy that turned 500$ into a million on Tesla calls, I think is the best yolo I‚Äôve ever seen. Everyone‚Äôs got 500$ to gamble not everyone has 50,000$
I SOLD TESLA FOR THIS SHIT. TAKE ME TO THE FUCKIN MOOOOON. REEEEEEEEEEEEüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Sold my Tesla shares and bought all GME. I hope we are right boys because I‚Äôm ready to be rich.
Feels like the wrong lesson. It sounds like you were buying tesla just for the volatility of the stock so you could make quick money and repeat. If you believed in the company you would not be quick swing trading it. I literally did the same thing with tesla and sold at 300 something last year after I was comfortable with the money I made. In hindsight obviously I wish I saw tesla for what the market sees but I did exactly what my original goal was.I still have shares in companies from that time that I have only held and never sold my position on because those are the companies I trust.If you interpret every volatile upwards spike as news that you shouldn't sell you will get shit on eventually.
Probably just as knowledgeable. Honest to god, some of these capital management firms are run by a bunch of crooks.I used to have a bank manage my investments and they pretty much lost all the money I gave em. They would not buy Apple, google, Amazon or Tesla. And now look... $200- $1000 per stock now. Grab a text book, open an account, and do it yourself. Fuck em. Fuck Wall Street. Fuck banks.
So what does Burrys successful GME call mean for tesla now
I mean, theres still teslabut in terms of the amount of memes in short term?
#IF YOU DIDN'T MAKE MONEY TODAY YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT IN GMEHow the fuck can I do anything over my weekend now?I'm gonna be fantasizing about Buying a Tesla Roadster after GME hits $1000
Last time posting this so as many retards can hear this. Hold tight retards and tell your paperhanded bitch ass friends to hold. This is not the end of the squeeze. I REPEAT. THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE SQUEEZE. This is the start of something great. GME IS THE NEXT TESLA. Today‚Äôs price action is resulted entirely from Citron‚Äôs terrible bear thesis. His thesis showed big money speculators that bear aren‚Äôt shorting this for a secret reason... they are just using outdated thesis of thinking GME is a brick and mortar store. That is why the price went up so much today. And yes some shorts definitely covered. What we need to understand is this: there are going to be people continuing shorting after this bunch cover not because of a sinister reason but because they truly don‚Äôt believe in the future of the company. But we retards have firm conviction in Ryan Cohen and the strongest of diamond hands. So despite short attacks our share price might drop but eventually consolidates. And after every good news(like citron‚Äôs bear thesis yesterday took time for people to process)We will do this over and over until our stocks goes to the absolute fucking moon. Hold tight boys. This ain‚Äôt vw... this is Tesla. Gme already did this many times in the past when this stock was at the single digits-20 dollars, so there‚Äôs your proof.

Squeeze your way to a milly bro, fuck you and go get yourself a Tesla, save the earth
So jump to $87? Gme jumped to 72, pulled back to 65, and with the same ratio as Tesla that's 87. Possible. But you're undervaluing it. This shits going to 420 and break wall street
Technically, it's possible we could maybe zoom to $1000 on Monday, but it's much more likely we continue battling the big bois as we have for the last several months, consolidating for a week or two, making a big move up, repeat. Zoom out your chart and see how we made it this far. If nothing else, they'll want to push the price down to get a cheaper entry.Don't get deflated if it doesn't go to Pluto next week and puss out. HOLD LONG TERM. We got a highly committed genius at the helm now and big plans, and will likely move up the way Tesla and Chewy did. /r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/

I‚Äôm not fucking selling til I can pay off my student loans, buy a Tesla, and keep 150k in other positions. Diamond hands boys
I really hope this place never shuts down. I've only been here a year, but since then I've become almost 10k richer, and had a lot of fun doing it. I'll remember all the money I made on SPY puts during Covid, Tesla mooning, and fucking the GME shorts for the rest of my life. Here's to more WSB memories!
Surely? I mean Tesla was at $100 just over a year ago and now it‚Äôs at over $800, never say never haha
I just sold all my Tesla position to fully load into BB.
I feel like I accidentally clicked on WSB and I'm not even subbed there. How can anyone think that this is a safe or good idea?I mean I say that and tesla is still up like 600% in a year, but STILL... The insanity can only go so far, right?
Hold your shares. This is going to squeeze like Tesla and not vw. I firmly believe that and that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt take my 66k profits from my 2k shares. People are going to be consistently doubting/shorting this company, but we retards believe in Cohen to push this company forward so we hold, and price consolidates. Every good news will propel this stock to further new heights and Cohen could issue new shares during every squeeze to get cash to reinvent this company. I‚Äôm holding this until I become a millionaire.
I traded 1 Tesla for 16 GME @ 49.00 üòé
Despite the other comments, I think this is a good question.The first step is confronting a common fallacy.  When a stock rises in market cap (for example, let‚Äôs say the market cap has risen $20 billion in the past week) that does **not** mean that $20 billion dollars of net cash has flowed into the company.  It‚Äôs easier to see this when you are using smaller numbers.  Let‚Äôs say I start a company and issue 5 shares at $1 per share.  My company has a market cap of $5.  Now let‚Äôs say one of the shares gets sold in the secondary market for $3.  Even though only $3 has been spent on the stock, the market cap is now $15 ($3 times 5 shares).You can extrapolate this and expand it to bigger companies.  Market cap is based on the most recent stock transaction price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares.  So if Tesla has $1 billion outstanding shares and the most recent Tesla share sold for $850, then Tesla has a market cap of $850 billion.  If no one else sold any shares and you bought a share for $1,000, the market cap would balloon (at least for one split second) to $1 trillion.  You injected only $1,000 into the stock market but where able to increase the market cap by $150 billion. As others have mentioned, if net capital is flowing out of stocks and prices are still rising, this probably means that more people are holding their shares (or possibly share buybacks are playing a role).  This leads to a lower number of outstanding shares available to sell in the market, and allows for the market cap to rise more quickly even when more money is flowing out of a stock.
sold all my tesla for gme üíéüôåüèªüôåüèªüíé
this is tesla at $100. right now
Hold these shares with your dear life. The opportunity for gme is endless beyond one single squeeze. Just for an example right now, the volatility of this stock can be used by big tutes to trade derivatives on. That‚Äôs how Tesla has the highest option volume. Fucking gme can be the next tesla if we the share holders are fearlesss and hold our stock. Do not fucking sell. Pull back is imminent, but Watch your net worth go up more aNd more overtime.

My guess would be no one is willing to sell their shares of Amazon, Google, Tesla. There are still people buying the name brand stocks but more money is flowing out of the companies that are going bankrupt or are unprofitable. The big stocks are a larger portion of the stock market so little trade in those have a bigger effect but the dollars are moving more out of the smaller unprofitable stocks?
Fuck that gay shit OP should buy a Tesla Model S and pick up hot chicks at college.
Could this go the way of Tesla?
I am making money on GME but not nearly as much as some. I am legit so fucking happy for the people who had the stones to put a sizable chunk of money on GME calls. Tesla has made people rich, but I know GME has and will continue to do the same. Something magical about the small guy taking on Goliath and winning.&amp#x200BSeriously, when it comes time to sell (which is NOT NOW), that you all are smart with your newfound wealth. GME is going to be financially life changing for so many of you. Don't fuck it up.
This is the fight against the system! It could be the biggest money maker for retail since Tesla, remember:- buy- hold- wait for short squeeze (no it hasn't happened)- sell at retirement money
Sold more TESLA, up to 87 GME from 69. Let's gooo.
Agreed. Tesla was doing a lot before the insane run up but the high valuation does make the company feel more stable. Especially when they raise 5bn and Elon‚Äôs answer to why is so nonchalant. ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt really need it, could‚Äôve gone either way honestly, decided to pay down some debt.‚Äù
In for more while Tesla is sliding. Should I sell that 15k and buy GME more????
We are fixing the market. Gamestop has a chance to succeed now isntead of the shorters pushing them to bankruptcy like they almost did to Tesla.
Actually Tesla could for sure be a customer and Space X already works with BlackBerry...
Alright, thanks man. Guess I'll just hold on to it. I think the only potential competitor would be Tesla, sicne they have their own OS.
Citron: Our view on Tesla was wrong because we were looking at the numbers.Citron 5 seconds later: You want to know why GameStop sucks. Let‚Äôs look at the numbers.Can't make this shit up lolANYWAY üöÄüöÄüöÄ ITS HAPPENING
I wish ol‚Äô Musky would announce Tesla charging stations at all GameStop stores. We‚Äôd all have enough money to buy Tesla‚Äôs at that point.
I sold $TSLA at $390 pre-split after playing it for years. Held for almost 2 years and sold just a month early, turning a 10 bagger into a measly 40% gain. That was over a year ago. I'm still depressed. I'm not making that mistake here. Don't be like me and tesla. Don't. Fuckin. Sell.
Just sold all my stock in Tesla and bought GME, let's do this!
Also many growth stocks require a high valuation to finance their growth. If shorts depress the valuation they can damage the company. A bit of a self fulfilling prophecy. Ie: Tesla has a crazy high valuation which allows them to raise as much capital as they need to build tons of factories, without the high valuation they wouldn‚Äôt be able to do as much.
If the short squeeze is successful, and it darn will if we keep holding, we will most likely be a feature in some Netflix documentary. Heck, we will be featured in finance and MBA lectures as a case study too, the way I studied the VW short squeeze back in university. We making history bois, I wish to buy a Tesla 3 with a number plate 'WSB GME GANG' to remember the times.
I miss all the loss porn. Now people only brag about gains and never post losses. I lost count of how many tesla gain posts i saw 2 weeks ago with their deep otm calls, and ive seen maybe 1 loss post since teslas been back down
Which one should I sell for more GME - Tesla , Aphria , Palantir or Jumia ? Or ALL OF THAT SHIT !!!
I‚Äôm thinking of dropping my Tesla for more GME ü§™
Looking at my last two shares of Tesla.. sorry papa elon, papa cohen needs me. I'll be back one day
ALL ABOARD THE NEW TESLA
It's not even just buying Tesla calls, any dipshit could see Intel firing a CEO was no reason for AMD to go down ~12% in a week and there was a tonne of posts calling this out but they all got caught at 200 upvotes while dumb memes clogged the front page.Now AMD is running up and people have missed out.
Sold $15k worth of Tesla let‚Äôs put this shit in let‚Äôs go
This was my ira a few days ago https://imgur.com/sdwGZ2j now it's $208kToo bad I didn't sell my 33 Tesla shares for mroe gme
Small timer here, sold my 1 Tesla and bought 9 more GME, got a limit order for another 9 in case it dips! Let‚Äôs goooo üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåñüåñüåñ
I could write multiple paragraphs about Tesla even though I have no positions there but I doubt anyone would read them so my short take is that even though there are some bubbles rn, what we might be looking at is the market improving the old valuation methods and even ditching some in order to adapt to the rising importance of data and intangible assets.It is a steep shift with Tesla being the prime example and it is leaving boomers scratching their heads and screeching "bubble".At the end of the day I am an idiot so what do I know, this is what I think is happenning and I might be dead wrong and the market might be in a massive dot com bubble.
Tesla Model 3 explodes in Shanghai residential car park. One less car to recall. Bullish ü§©
PLTR is the Tesla of 2015. We will get there bro. Stonks only go up.
I've been putting money in the stock market for a little bit now but I don't really know as much as I need to. And a lot of times I don't know if y'all are being serious about shit or not so I just stick to my safe little etfs, but I sold all my weed stocks and some tesla to throw about 8k at this shit because I can definitely tell y'all ain't playing with this. Cheers to the moon landing from a smooth brained basic bitch!!

tesla is fundamentally overvalued for ages now sooo
Does anyone of you guys still hold on tesla or other golden nuggets? I think i‚Äôll go full retard and put it all on GME. Ps: love u autists &amp retards! üöÄüöÄüöÄüõ∏
I remember the loss porn. It was a thing of beauty.In this retarded market any autist can make money with Tesla calls, we lost that. Also proof or ban.
My aunt got in on it when it was like 150 and bought like a thousand shares. She now has 4000 since the split and about 3.5 mill in Tesla stock alone. She has stopped working &amp now she is living in Taiwan being a crazy rich Asian. Thing is she is going through a nasty divorce so hopefully her asshole ex doesn‚Äôt get half of that.
You‚Äôll be able to buy back in your tesla position once we‚Äôve landed on the moon. üíé‚úã
Let me get this right Youre deep in Tesla, and only 80 shares in GME... Are you fucking insane?!?!? Have you learnt nothing from lurking for years?!?!?
Memes are getting too much at the moment. People karma farming with rockets üöÄ is starting to do my head in a bit. For me, WSB became a meme sub last summer when everyone hopped on Tesla. The proportion of good DD to memes is the lowest ratio its ever been on here. In terms of publicity and public eye, I think Pandora's box has been well and truly opened. I have 0 doubts that media outlets, cramer, all have interns positioned on here perusing and even trying to purport their own narratives. TLDR rockets üöÄ üë©‚ÄçüöÄ
Apple, Tesla, NEE, SAP are relevant for me. But I see also MS, FB, AT&ampT, lot of big ones to come
Seeing a hedge fund who only made 5% returns in 2020 explain their performance to their "partners" is funny&gtWe also managed to sidestep most of the significant second-half rally in Tesla (TSLA), as we adjusted our position ahead of its inclusion in the S&ampP 500 index. Even so, TSLA was our largest loser in 2020, with most of the losses coming in the first half of the year. TSLA cars are not a fad if they were, TSLA would sell many more than it does. The fad is in owning TSLA stock&amp#x200BAnd obviously they blame retail investors.&gtA second group of valuation-indifferent investors are the new masses of retail investors, who simply have no training or competency in valuation.

Think the most underrated part of this play with GME &amp everyone playing it is the collective wealth and buying power of the people that visit this sub just going wayyyyyy up. I think for the long run and health of future plays it‚Äôs just going to be crazy. Kinda like what Tesla did to this sub but on a whole other scale.
Yeah,  buy and tesla call at any point for any price
I bought into Tesla at 200.   My wife sold most of it before the split so I‚Äôm not Coke whore rich.   I‚Äôm pretty sure that was her plan.
I bet they are gonna send a second tesla to Mars with the body driving in a space suit. That's how the lizard people replaced Elon.
I absolutely love Tesla, while everyone is focused on them they're leaving loads of other opportunities for the other investors in stocks without a cult following.  Even if Tesla can justify their valuations, and even if they're making loads of people rich, it's very silly too rely on a single stock for your future.
LMFAO to the max. 350,000 doesn't sound crazy? I agree with the growth perspective but is that not priced in? At current figures tesla needs 1120 years to make enough value to buy all tesla shares. For example Samsung needs 12 years. But your absolutely right because scientists say that the sun won't die out for another billion years. Btw tesla needs to grow 121% a year for 30 years straight to somewhat justify that price. Going back to the lemonade investment why not pick some other lemonade maker (EV) such General mot... I mean General lemonade that sells 5000 dollars of lemonade is charging 60 thousands(billion). And btw how do you plan to make 1% if the world drink that lemonade?
I loved Elon so much, I had all the merchandise and models. I'd pray to Elon every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. "Tesla is love", I would say, "Tesla is life". My dad hears me and calls me a üåàüêª. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Elon. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep.I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Elon. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, "This is my Gigafactory". He grabs me with his powerful demigod hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Elon. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Elon. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please a Elon. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Elob looks him straight in the eye, and says, "It's all EV now". Elon leaves through my window. Elon is love. Elon is life.Ôªø
I do have shares, but just remember, when people write calls, they typically write covered calls. They need shares before they can even sell me the call. 50x100 = 5000 shares locked up but for a third of the price. Kinda different situation, but a nice read.

The obvious answer is tesla, but another curveball is apple, its pre pandemic p/e was 15 now its 30 so idk just my opinion but yea apple is a little overvalued
Thinking of taking $10K Tesla profits to gamble on this. Too late to buy in or am I just in time for the fireworks?
You forgot daddy tesla, the og
Am I the only that thinks Elon will split stock next week? volume has been lagging cause no retail is gonna buy at those prices and we know how much he cares about the stock performance. Literally no reason NOT to do it, would probably push it past the 1tril mark. It has to happen, it has to happen now.Tesla stock price is too high imo=============
Questionable?He shorted Nvidia, Tesla, Shopify, and more.If you I versed him last year, you'd be up over 300% on average.
TBH this is going to look like Tesla in 2020. Don't think there's going to be an infinity squeeze which is better because it controls the paper hands
I have spent thousands in Bitcoin. All of it has been on drugs. Unless you absolutely have to spend it, it's like using Tesla shares to buy an Xbox. If I never bought any drugs I could probably retire, lol.
Andrew is proud because he‚Äôs the first short seller to go long Tesla and is ‚Äúup like 90% since‚Äù. He‚Äôs basically saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a dope and missed out on 610% gains and had FOMO so changed my mind.‚ÄùThis fucker reading off a computer screen too. I don‚Äôt trust a damn thing this fool has to say. He couldn‚Äôt go live because his balls weren‚Äôt big enough to run through his 5 reasons with so many critics watching.

Remember the proverb from cathie wood, the longer the shaft, the BIGGER the DICK. It took tesla 6-7 years of staying flat af to rocket to where it is today right? So many doubters and haters. Gme graph might look choppy af from that time frame, but if we focus on marketcap, it‚Äôs a consistent downward trend... so what does that mean? This means that GME essentially had a flat graph.... if we break out of this price range of its original high... and hold ourselves there. We can become the next great. These 3-50 dollars movement will seem midget to us when the share price reaches 500. Way of the road. Hold tight. Strap in.

I‚Äôm about to sell my tesla i‚Äôve had for over 5 years and YOLO it all into GME
I did the same on Tesla. I worked my way from 10k to 150k and luckily I transferred 50k out, because I nearly lost the entire thing fomoing as Tesla went crazy last March. My advice to you is never try to win your money back right away, accept your loss and make sure you have a clear mind before reentering a position. I'm sure you already know that now, but it's always good to hear again. Good luck on the future, you clearly have it in you to win big again, patience üëç
Market opinion company. They make some statement with some fluff and analysis and people believe them. Problem being their analysis has been shit. They bet Shopify to be less than 100, it's 1200. They bet Tesla to be 300 or some shit, it's almost 900 after split. They make losing bets.
Of the thousands of stocks you can bet against with puts....you picked Tesla LOLOLOLOL
A Tesla you say?
Yea keep shorting tesla. It's been working out so well this past year

Biggest bull bet here. GME is about to be like Tesla. I could be deathly wrong and you won‚Äôt have to bash me later because I would be losing a lot of my money then so, Why?1. Cult of investors2. Ryan Cohen3. Revolutionize/position the company into the field of gaming, which is growing and will keep growing at an explosive rate4. Consistent short interest
Imagine going from middle class to Tesla multi millionaire and not selling. Wtf is wrong with these people, this one guy talking about leaving them for his children??? Buddy just retire already and live the good life.

In the video he says he changed his mind on Tesla after shorting it and it going up. Also known as fucking failing lol. Then claims credit as it being a good investment and making 90% on shares without mentioning how much he lost before caving on his brilliant short strategy.
I agree with the sentiment, but disagree with the FAANG example since Netflix isn‚Äôt even as much of a tech company as Disney is these days. They‚Äôve always been the company that doesn‚Äôt belong in the acronym.Unfortunately my suggested acronym of Facebook, Apple, Google, Oracle, and Tesla never quite caught on.
Fucking bitch ass tesla
I stumbled upon this nest of retards yesterday. I read through some posts about GME and understood absolutely nothing and thought that this was nothing but peak autism.All I needed was to scroll through the wholesome camaraderie that is this comment section to sell my 2 tesla shares and some other shit I owned.84 shares of GME later and I'm with you guys to the end of the line.Hold strong.
there's too much fucking momentum w/ this thing, it's like when tesla ran and all the retards had piled in early.  who cares about a fucking "reversal" when you're up like at least 50%
TESLA DOWN 5% PROBABLY BECAUSE 99% OF YOU RETARDS SOLD YOUR SHARES THERE FOR GME. LETS GOOOOO
If we consider Tesla as ‚Äútech‚Äù, we can say 90% of the market is tech.
Just sold all my Tesla Amazon and apple shares for the boys üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
30 shares of Tesla liquidated for the cause boys
I watched and summarized his points so you don't have to watch his video. 1. The short squeeze won't happen - "Why is there a high short interest?"  - $40 - Open borrow at decent rate - Plenty of options  - Trading phenomenom - A lot of call volume 	- He has no problems selling the company higher 	- As long as borrow is available, insiders are still selling, and company needs money, there will be no squeeze2. Numbers don't lie - Citron was first short sellers to start going long on Tesla  - NPD report on GME. Harper Sales up 23%, GME down 9% - losing to Amazon, best buy, target, walmart  - Current business is drowning3. Valuations matter - This is a retailer, and valuation must be based on other retailers  - Analysts has $12 target on the price  - 2021 ebda - $330 million, street is at $71 million, Citron expects negative ebda 	- Target stock price should be at $26  - Trading at 40x ebda	- Apple is trading at 20x  - GME is expensive 4. Know who are on the opposite side of the trade  - Something about reddit being geniuses and he needs to get on Tinder  5. Company can become your biggest enemy  - $1 Billion in debt  - To make an acquisition they will need to sell a lot of stock  - Either this company will be JC Penny or Blockbuster
Everyone spam Bitchron‚Äôs Twitter with this articlehttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.htmlThe dude is actually trying to say he was ‚Äúone of the first shorts to go long on Tesla after the story had changed.‚ÄùWhat he left out was that he tried to short Tesla back in 2018. Instead of it going down, it went massively up. He got so mad that he actually tried to SUE ELON AND TESLA.
LMAO Andrew Left saying he saw the value in tesla's numbers and went long.... dude, everyone here knows that Tesla isn't correlated to it's numbers, it hasn't been since 2018. Get outta here
Sold Tesla, bought GME. This is the way!
Psh, one of the first shorts to go long on Tesla after the story had changed? More like he got an ass whooping, then tried to actually SUE TESLA AND ELON MUSK, before finally capitulating like a bitch.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.htmlFuck Bitchron!
You are suggesting Musk controls the stock price and that Tesla will x2 on earnings this quarter?
I'm actually unironically pissed off at his video. Not cos of some kneejerk reaction to opposition, just the fucking gall this motherfucker has to just come out and literally make one of his point "the only people long gamestop are poor people."On top of the dude acting like him turning on Tesla was a good thing. "I was wrong and admitted it" is not a positive trait for a short seller you dickwipe. Guess what - I wasn't wrong about tesla and im up much more than the '98%' you're waving your tiny manclit over. Combined with his bullshit "go ahead and hack me, u mad?" has made me increase my holdings by 20%. Eat shit Andrew. I know you won't respond when you inevitably fold. God i'm mad boys.
My guess is, it's the Tesla story all over again. He'll come around being long after he bled enough money. But this time the loss of reputation for blatantly shouting out hAcKfRaUd and poorly researched information will crush his career. Srsly man, who's gonna take him serious after that?!  I would almost feel bad for the guy BUT he lost all sympathy with his disgusting arrogance *"we know more than you / you just deliver my pizza"* **LOL!** Crush this dickhead. No sympathy from me old fart. Transferring more money. May the afterburn of our rocket forever burn your reputation... üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I'm gay but I went straight for tesla first, the other gay bears stayed gayer for much longer. Literally his post.
Easier for GOEV to x2 than for Tesla to x2 at these market caps.
Actually Tesla has done the same thing twice in the past year
That was the most superficial DD I have ever heard. It was basically:1. You can still short the stock. Yeah no shit you can still short the stock. Vanguard will be more than happy to loan you shares at 25%. Everytime they loan you shares to short, your firm sells them, vanguard buys them right back and then loans them to you again. 2. They still have physical locations.Yeah no shit. That's the whole point of their pivot to E-commerce. The gaming industry will be worth hundreds of billions in 5-10 years. All gamestop needs is 10% of a 500 billion dollar market and boom 50 billion dollar company. 3. Valuation should be based on brick and mortar. Oh yeah? Well then shouldn't Tesla valuation be based on the fact they sell cars?Or should Tesla's valuation be based on the fact they will one day in the future sell battery storage products, solar roofs, and hyperloops of whatever the fuck Elon wants? Tesla's valuation is based on the man behind the wheel. Same with GME 4. Melvin capital is a lot smarter than us.Yeah ok that's nice. So they are never wrong? They won't be wrong on this? If I had a fucking dollar the boomer hedge funds said "buy this stock" or "sell this stock" and we're wrong I would have more money to play with than shitron. There is a reason analyst change their "price targets" every fucking day. Cause in reality nobody knows fuck shit. 5. Yeah they already said they will issue more shares. Or do a shelf offering. But check this out, they said they would offer 100 million. Well take share price rn. 100 million divided by 40 only equals 2.5 million shares. There is over 70 million shares shorted. You're telling me you'll be able to cover with a skimpy fucking 2.5 million shares?Also, you think Ryan Cohen accumulated all those shares just for GME to turn around and dilute them? Yeah I doubt that. They see the squeeze coming and will offer a shelf offering when price hits $100. That means they only have to issue a million shares. Oh and another thing. Gamestop doesn't have fucking 1 billion in debt. They have less than 500 million in total debt and 25 million in short term. What Shitron talking head is referencing is their current liabilities are high at 1.5 billion. Sorry to break it to you but that's the whole point of shutting down 11% of the stores that are unprofitable. They are reducing their lease obligation and they will look to lower their accounts payable. Debt isn't the problem. The brick and mortar stores are bad those are going bye bye.
Tesla is up 100% in the last 3 months, Andrew realized his short position was wrong on Tesla and it has since "gone up 90%", which means Andrew only just realized a few months ago that Tesla was a good buy. But he thinks he's right about GME....lol
WHOA! He's up 90% on Tesla! ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
Basically he was short Tesla and then he went long  and is up 90% there.Yay?Being up 90% in Tesla meant you woke up late. My original purchase of Tesla is up about 1,600%.No idea anything he says about valuation of Gamestop, but I am going with folks here who actually are a bit closer in age to people who buy games and what potential Gamestop has there then anyone my age (41) let alone someone a few years older has to say about this.He clearly lacks a deep understanding of Gamestop (as do I) and he thinks you are all garbagemen and pizza delivery boys and therefore clearly incapable of thinking this trough. I think he should listen to what others are waking up to, namely, in the gross stupidity here, there is a collective genius and wisdom that is not quite understood by others.Hoping you guys are right about Gamestop. I will be fine either way, but I am coming to believe that you are truly onto something. If GME pays off nicely for me based on what I have learned here, I might form a dangerous confirmation bias about what is said here.
Lol Citron's 5 reasons for $20:1. Short Squeeze - He says it's not real. Won't happen. Period. (No explanation)2. Numbers Don't Lie - NPD said Gamestop sucks. Dead brick and mortar model.3. Valuations Matter - GameStop is not Tesla. Hedgeye says GME sucks.4. Know Who's on Other Side of Trade - Says pizza delivery guys, Tinder whores, and Twitter hackerz are the owners. Also Ryan Cohen, who is a billionaire.5. Company Can Become Your Biggest Enemy - GameStop can sell stock and screw us all. Same management. Thinks numbers went up due to holiday sales. Compares stock to JCP and Blockbuster.HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA eat this motherfucker alive, boys.
I dont care how solid you think Tesla does any company that doubles its value in a month without changing its market share is in a bubble. Hell Elon said it was overpriced at around $400 a share
Ask Tesla share holders.
Of course $43 is high for gamestop, imo. But fuck it, the stock market is retarded right now in general. Look at Tesla, look at Airbnb.. Nothing makes sense. So why the fuck shouldn't I shove ¬£700 on a dying business model company that a bunch of reddit weirdos are convinced will go to the moon haha
Not if but when! When it does you can pay off their debt and you can buy a Tesla
Fuck it, just sold all my Tesla shares to buy 24 shares of GME üöÄ
If RC becomes CEO the sky really is the limit. It‚Äôs hard to overestimate the impact of a good CEO.  Look at AMDs all time chart and the moment when Su Bae entered. Or Tesla since Musk became CEO. Or even Fastly since Feb last year.
IMO, it's even more specific - it's companies valued like tech that aren't really tech that are overvalued.  Look at the FAANGs, the best examples of true tech companies, which have absurd margins because their costs are so low.  That's what tech is for me - when technology allows scaling beyond other businesses.Compare Apple with Tesla - Apple's gross margin on an iPhone is 60-70% while Tesla's most popular car, the Model 3, has a gross margin around 10%.  This means Apple is basically printing money with every one of their phones they sell, and can afford to take big risks, try new businesses, etc, while Tesla struggles to break even.  It's not really a fixable problem - it's just a lot cheaper to make a phone compared to what people are willing to pay for it than a car.The same goes for the other FAANGs - Google, Facebook, Amazon's costs to host pale in comparison to the money they bring in for ads/hosting fees.  Compare that to some of these companies with ridiculous P/E and thin margins - that are valued like the early days of the big tech companies, but without the same scaling advantages.  2 of my go-to examples are Vail Resorts (MTN) and Chipotle (CMG) - each having P/E around 200.  Their costs aren't going to barely increase like tech companies growing with huge revenue increases.  Yes, they can grow a ton, but their margins are never going to be as big as the tech companies they're valued like.
It‚Äôs this years Tesla.
PREORDERING MY TESLA NOW BOYS
these boomer fucks are like me in 2020, saying tesla is gonna burst and crying while im proven wrong again and again. GME LETS GO
Yeah I was gonna say if you cherry pick Tesla as tech then tech is obv overvalued
PLTR is what Tesla was 3 years ago. Just keep holding and the payday gonna be epic
worth the risk selling my 0.79 share of Tesla to purchase more?
wtf the lies he is speaking...1) He says he's long tesla but he sued tesla for manipulating markets2) GME has a debt of 1 b?!?! somebody hold me
Honestly I dont believe in the future of the company, never did, never will. But you retards are an inspiration and I dont mind burning 2k just to be on your side. Ive sold Tesla 2 years ago. Time for another mistake
I was a pussy in early 2020 with TeslaI was a pussy with GMEI'm not gonna be a pussy this time. Just threw an entire paycheck into BB. At the VERY LEAST I want to double my money so I can pull out my capital.
Just cashed out on Tesla. Running out of things to sell fellas. HOLD
OMG Tesla, just kill me already
This may be your last chance to board the rocket ship. You missed out on tesla. You missed out on apple. You missed out on AMD. Are you really going to miss out again? Don't be retarded. Load up.
If 2020s Tesla Bull run taught us anything, it's that retards always win. The year is 2022 and GME is sitting at $300  üöÄ üöÄ  üöÄ
Do I sell my Tesla to buy this GME dip ?
&gt your honour, I put to you that a user named shreksdick posted that the other Redditor‚Äôs wive‚Äôs boyfriends are getting mad at them for being gay, and that they should buy the fucking dip, which resulted in a 7% gain in Tesla that dayThis would be thrown out of court faster than trumps election fraud cases
Imagine selling TESLA for $100
Exactly. The slow and boring stuff basically. Solid staples with established supply chain rarely drop in value over time, and if they do it's hardly significant. But they don't get the hype so people don't pay attention to them during bull runs.Now Tesla/NIO, etc? Yeah I'm staying out of all that
WSB has numerous people posting about losses they have. It is not a pump and dump rather it is simply a collective research tool that allows individual investors to connect and share thoughts about a stock that puts them on a more equal footing with the big guys. No one here individually understands a single company or the market that well, but together, the pieces can come together beautifully.Heck, I am often in the Tesla investor forum and I am long Tesla with a substantial amount of shares and lots of gains there. When I first bought Tesla is was due to belief that they were the future, although I was unsure if they would remain solvent. In any case, long story short, since I joined that sub I have learned more about a company then I ever understood about any business in my life. Every day I find out and can analyze with others any tidbit relating to vehicles or batteries and what it means. I understand very deeply what their opportunities are and what the competition is and hell yeah, I am loooonnng. Mark my words, barring some big upset, Tesla is on pace to being worth $5K-10K per share by 2030. Very few people out there understand their competitive strengths and I grow tired explaining it. It is too hard for people to really think and do the math on what the 4680 structural cells mean. They will find out soon enough. Then of course FSD is a huge deal, but timewise the 4680 structural cell has a much more definite date on the calendar.
Ford lives to exist between 6 and 12. It's like the skinny chick that can't grow tits no matter how much she eats, or the fat chick that can't lose her gut, no matter how much she diets. Like yeah, they both give great head and take it in the butt, but they are not high class whores like Tesla or anything.
Lol should I exit more 3 Tesla shares and buy GME? I‚Äôm honestly not in here for the squeeze(while that‚Äôs definitely another upside) but for RC‚Äôs potential to carry this company.
Just remember gents we are the ones who started the Tesla storm. Don‚Äôt underestimate our power. Just buy and hold.
Anyone catch the end of Mad Money last night? Cramer did a bit about $$ getting burned by betting against CEOs. Netflix, Tesla, Amazon, Apple - all shorted, all defied the $$ bet against them. I took 1 thing away from that segment: if you believe in Ryan Cohen, believe in GME.&amp#x200BEdit: also üöÄüöÄüöÄ
PSA from an OG TSLA bull, TSLA is up 375% from last Feb when Shitron said even [Elon would short at those levels.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-04/even-musk-would-short-tesla-at-this-level-citron-research-says)And up roughly 2,000% since he said he was [shorting it in March 2016.](https://money.cnn.com/2016/03/02/investing/tesla-citron-research-short-elon-musk/index.html)TLDR: Buy, üíéüçÜ, üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ, üåô
If Elon Musk belly flopped in like shamu üêã and bought 1 million shares just to fuck with citron for what they did to Tesla, I would take all my profits and put it back in Tesla!
Tesla isn't overvalued, everything else is just undervalued
Yup.  I am 100% certain stocks are NOT in a bubble (utilities, most consumer staples, most industrials, telecoms, big food), but tech is.  The money supply argument is interesting but doesn't explain why some tech companies have P/Es of 200 - 1400 and whether that is sustainable and whether, for example, investors will decide to shift money from Tesla and Zoom into utilities.
I asked my 80+ year old mother in law what she thought of tesla about a year ago. (She sits in her chair watching fox news) she said they catch fire. Dangerous. Lol - she‚Äôs a boomer i guess.  I guess I‚Äôm gen x.
I agree it might not be a 2000 repeat. But there are a number of stocks that look to be bizarrely overvalued. Like people are still buying Tesla at 1600 times earnings.... quite frightening to see
It‚Äôs actually not a bad move. Not everyone on this subreddit is some teenager living in their wife‚Äôs boyfriends basement. There are ton of professionals and even professional traders. Many think this is a steal. I missed out on Tesla. Won‚Äôt miss this.
I do not wait for dips but if anything significant comes I'll be selling the rest of my Tesla shares and buying gme https://imgur.com/WYqkN9X
Lmao if we hit 30 I'm selling my Tesla and buying more gme. My ira will then be 100% gme
Lol, VW is also Audi and Porsche which are way more luxurious than a Tesla.
who in their right mind has any money left for tesla at this point. a possible 20% upside vs GME right now is just irresponsible
it's so weird actually typing out the company names like Apple, Tesla, Facebook after getting used to the ticker symbols whenever you're chatting with non trading people
This has become a sort of justified cult and I‚Äôm glad being part of it. They know perfectly that stocks surrounded with ready-to-die FOMOers are the worst ones to short (look Tesla), so sooner or later they will just join us and pump the shit out of this.Will they kill Melvin along the way? I fucking hope so.
Sold Tesla gainz to buy gme. Let's hope gme flies and Tesla holdssss
I got no interest in cars too, and I won't ever buy a tesla. Why would I ? It's just a glorified means of transport like all the other cars.
Rotation From Tesla to Ford.Time to milk that cow
I would argue that once ‚Äúpeople‚Äù realise Tesla isn‚Äôt super unique anymore the valuations will balance a bit throughout the industry.Tesla isn‚Äôt even the most sold in Europe anymore. VW is, does they mean they should x5 in value overnight to reflect Tesla‚Äôs multipliers? Unless EV makes a company more profitable or grow faster it shouldn‚Äôt change the valuation. I know it does, but that‚Äôs another story.
&gt In the future you will get a tax credit for buying an EV&gt    This is already there. But it the future, when all Vs are EVs the tax credit will not mean anything and will stop. All brands have EV models and by 2030 all new cars will be EVs. Tesla is the dominant brand for sure, but investors in Tesla are so forward looking that at the current price Tesla needs to sell roughly 12-15M cars a year to justify the price. This will most likely happen after 2030. And just to add this for comparison Microsoft and Amazon were both great companies in 2000 and are great companies today, though they still went through a lost decade in their stock price. Tesla is not immune to this. Does this mean i will go short Tesla now? Absolutely not. But considering any investment horizon of less than 10-15 years for Tesla is a joke. This is not an investor‚Äôs market anymore, its a trader‚Äôs market.
They don't need to. Just look at how long it's taken for Tesla to reach scale. Pumping out millions of cars a year without significant quality issues is not simple. Instead they can just work on building their own evs and scoop up any valuable startup brands once they are trading at more reasonable valuations.
Tesla explosion bullish. Show me another car that can remotely explode ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë
Tesla's big sell is that it is a company in the self driving car race. As far as who else is in there Google/Waymo, GM/Cruise, and Intel/Mobileye. Mobileye recently revealed that Intel is building out LIDAR hardware for them, if Intel can deliver on a cost effective solution that would probably give Mobileye an edge. Musk has refused to use LIDAR due to costs concerns and that may screw Tesla over in the long run. Waymo seems to be the leader, they have self driving taxis in Arizona already, they used to have safety drivers behind the wheel but they moved on to completely self driving without a driver. Apple is also in the race but I'm not sure what they are doing. I would go with Alphabet/Intel. Who makes the cars is probably not as important as whose tech is allowed to drive the cars.
I loved Elon so much, I had all the merchandise and models. I'd pray to Elon every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. "Tesla is love", I would say, "Tesla is life". My dad hears me and calls me a üåàüêª. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Elon. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep.I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Elon. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, "This is my Gigafactory". He grabs me with his powerful demigod hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Elon. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Elon. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please a Elon. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Elob looks him straight in the eye, and says, "It's all EV now". Elon leaves through my window. Elon is love. Elon is life.Ôªø

Who needs to drink Coca Cola when you can drink a Tesla.
literally cant go tits up. we got the attention of whales and press - once in a lifetime opportunity, like buying tesla at $35
Tesla $1000 tomorrow. California registrations up 63%
I mean if this Tesla explosion is true I‚Äôve got no choice but to buy the absolute fuck out of that dip tomorrow, explosion today, moon tomorrow.
You guys remember buying TSLA at $39? Just fucking buy shares and long dated calls or spreads if you scared. Watch the Phoenix rise from the ashes on the back of a golden retriever.   If you wish you had 10, 20, 500, 2000 shares of Google, Amazon, or Tesla back when you could afford them, this is your chance. Mr. Cohen is about to turn GameStop into a verb. If you‚Äôre not poor then shares and leaps and FDs on the reg. Because this bitch will hit 25-50% any day of the week. Every time a fuckin lemon ass short covers FDs print. Until SI is 10% that possibility remains. And the long term upside is *chef‚Äôs kiss* üëåüöÄüÜìüíÖ
"looks at tesla"  HMMMM
Tesla has posted profits, are ramping up multiple factories for large scale production, and their big winner when it comes to income, carbon credits, are likely to get a nice bump in premium as the Dems pursue a green recovery agenda. I'm not a Tesla cultist but I'd temper my expectations if I were you. They'll correct eventually but it won't be within most critics' time horizons.
I had a few grand in Tesla before it burned up 800% in a year. Now I‚Äôve put the gains from that into this. I don‚Äôt really care about the potential squeeze. I think this is one of those rare opportunities where you‚Äôre going to see a company transform itself into something that will thrive. This more reminds me of when I invested in AMD. I put 400 bucks on it at 1.96. They were going bankrupt until Lisa Su stepped on board and completely changed the trajectory of the company. That 400 bucks returned a 4,000% profit by the time I sold. I feel like Ryan Cohen is exactly what the company needed.
There‚Äôs something freeing about having most of your net worth riding on a single stock. Like I‚Äôm either gonna pay off all my student loans and drive a Tesla, or I‚Äôm fooked   In the meantime I‚Äôm just riding the high

Since Tesla has huge LCD screens in their cars and will one day fully auto drive, a partnership with GameStop would be win win. Whose in? I wouldn‚Äôt mind playing some Mario Kart with 5G online while the cars driving itself.Hint: Papa Elon.
I‚Äôm gonna sell my Tesla and go all in GME.And I‚Äôm talking about my only car, not the stock.
Imagine he tweets. Get your tesla games through GME. Oof.
Tesla will sell Model Y‚Äôs exclusively at GameStop.  Yeah the stores are too small to be a showroom and they‚Äôd have to clear out tons of product to make space.  And this move in no way aligns with either company‚Äôs core business.  But you know it would work.
Short DD here: People started seeing how undervalued BB is-A company that is a world-renowned brand with the potential to be a major player in two industries of the future-Cybersecurity and IoT trading at just 7/1 P/S ratio. Furthermore QNX is already used by dozens of automakers, but for simple things like audio control systems and BB is not making much money by that. However that is because the industry as a whole has not catched up yet, but Tesla changed that. More and more automakers are accepting the fact that software and self-driving is the future of the industry and that is why BB partnered with Amazon to create a full blown OS for cars. In the future cars will be like huge computers with a lot of sensors that talk to each other and to other cars. With the BB OS, automakers and insurance companies will have access to that data and they also would also have the option to update their software whenever they like. Furthermore, third party developers will be allowed to make different apps for this cross-platform OS. BB might become a huge player, cuz the company was always known about developing hypersecure solutions and security will be extremely important with the development of the IoT. Imagine someone hacking your car and driving you into a tree.TL:DR BB and Amazon are developing an Android for cars.
I don't like Tesla and never have since I first saw them years ago.Look where they are now, up like a billion % from when I first thought they were overvalued.I think the lesson here is to try not to let your feelings get in the way of a good investment.
Yo wtf GME is selling at 0.4 P/E? If Tesla can reach a P/E of 1600 then surely GME can reach a P/E of at least... I dunno, 4? Fair price = $400/share LET'S GOOOO
BB owns 38,000 patents which is largely what the current valuation is based on since quarterly revenues suck.  Recently BB has proven the value of these patents both through litigation (FB suit) and sales of the patents (Huawei).    The bull case is built around their EV OS.  With Biden's plan for 50% of vehicles to be EVs by 2050, BB is looking attractive to capitalize off the need for software for these vehicles.  It basically boils down to BB having positioned itself for this opportunity over the past 5 years by developing the software and getting safety certifications (which are very hard to get).    The EV market is looking like it could mirror the smartphone market, with Tesla being the iPhone and all other EVs by other manufacturers running off QNX like how all other phones run off Android.  BB learned a lot from the smartphone market by being the big loser that got squeezed out of the market by iPhone/Android and is now positioned to take that lesson and capitalize off potentially an even bigger opportunity.
Elon should just Take  0,001% of his money and buy gme shares, and all of us would drive tesla, its simple math he would double win.

Stop focusing so much on the squeeze boys. Focus on this company‚Äôs potential. Think about all the things that Ryan Cohen could do to reinvent this company into a modern monster. I mean the consistent growth alone from this company‚Äôs potential reinvention by RC will come so natural and absolute beat the return of one single squeeze. Have faith and hold. The more I think about how this will play out in the long run. The more I want to add. Only selling if Something goes wrong with RC but that‚Äôs not gonna happen. When he has his vision set he‚Äôs going DEEP. He also knows that he has a bunch of retard fans following him so he prob loves that. We can be the next TESLA GUYS.
Anyone got Elon Musks' digits. Need to get him to join the army just for some additional revenge on shitron back when they tried to short Tesla. Could use his kinda big dick don't give a fuck money on our side.

I hope this thing squeezes so hard that the shorts will walk away crying. Being a long-term holder of Tesla I have come to dislike folks who short a company with the goal of destroying it (Citron is more likely trying to drive the price down to make money on the downside and attracting more short bettors before they jump to the long side and add to the squeeze).
This is payback for what they did to Tesla at closing bell before SP500 debut
In the future they gonna be asking themselves why they didn‚Äôt partake in this journey with us. GME is the embodiment of next Tesla, next apple. WE, LED BY RYAN COHEN, WILL MAKE THE NEXT GREAT GIANT. TAKE THIS JOURNEY TOGETHER BY BUYING TICKETS. Ride or die you won‚Äôt regret making HISTORY. üöÄ

One thing I would say against this is that WSB could be picking up stocks that have already started moving and they start talking about them and riding the wave even if the big institutions are what is actually moving the stock. I don‚Äôt really know how to test this but just a thought. I don‚Äôt think WSB could move mega cap stocks like Tesla, but the recent move of a smaller cap stock like GME could plausibly be moved by WSB
BUT WAIT, THERES MORE! IF YOU BUY NOW WE'LL THROW IN A FREE TESLA!

Think of it like the PS5: 10 people want to buy the PS5 with only 3 PS5‚Äôs on the market. The 3 sellers get to price the PS5 at whatever they want because of the buyer/seller imbalance. When shorts begin to cover their positions, the influx of buyers(and lack of sellers) will send the price skyrocketing. There‚Äôs no guarantee as to when they decide to start covering. Tesla shorts unwound their positions over a year. With GME, they shorted more shares than there are shares in existence.

‚ÄúIn the bucket shops of early 20th-century America, ordinary punters could bet on the direction of share prices with a tiny down-payment. The punters liked this, because it gave them a lot of notional exposure for a minuscule outlay. The bucket shops on the other side of the wagers loved it, too, because hour-to-hour fluctations in the price meant punters often got wiped out. No stock certificates ever changed hands. This was betting, pure and simple.This brings us to the rapid growth of the present-day options market. On average last year almost 30m equity options were traded each day on American exchanges, a rise of more than 50% from 2019, according to occ, the world‚Äôs largest clearer of such derivatives. In recent weeks, the volume has regularly risen above 40m a day (see chart).It is customary in polite society to discuss options in the language of insurance. The price of an option is known as a premium, for instance. And the need for insurance is one rationale for the growth in options. But impolite society, the natural habitat of Buttonwood, has a big say, too. Much of the surge in demand for options comes from small investors seeking long-odds bets on single stocks. The bucket-shop punter is back.To understand the connection, start with the idea that options are rights that carry no obligation. A financial option is the right to buy or sell an asset‚Äîa basket of stocks, say‚Äîat a specified price (the strike price) on or before a specified maturity date. Call options are rights to buy they are profitable to own if the price of the underlying asset rises above the strike price. Put options are rights to sell they pay off when the price of the underlying asset falls. The owner is not obliged to exercise the option she will do so only when the option is ‚Äúin the money‚Äù: ie, when the strike price is breached.The key influences on premiums are the gap between the asset‚Äôs strike price and its current price, time and expected volatility. A small gap is more likely to be closed than a large one, so options with strike prices close to prevailing prices cost more. Options with a strike price some distance from the actual price are said to be ‚Äúout of the money‚Äù and are cheaper. Similarly, options with a more distant maturity are more expensive than near-dated options. The key variable, though, is volatility. The more violently the price of the underlying asset fluctuates, the more chance there is that an out-of-the-money option will move into the money. When you own options, volatility is your friend.The range of options you can trade on a stock is a function of investor demand, says Hugh Selby-Smith of Talaria Capital, a Melbourne-based asset manager. If you want an option on, say, a Mexican retailer, you may have to ask an exchange to list an option series for you. But a high-profile stock, such as Tesla or Apple, will have 57 varieties of contract already listed. Tesla calls expiring on Friday January 15th were available this week at $5 intervals. The positions are staggering. There were some 27,000 contracts with a strike price of $1,000, for instance. (Tesla‚Äôs share price was around $860 on January 13th.) This kind of call option‚Äîdeeply out-of-the-money and close to expiry‚Äîis favoured by the new cohort of retail investors that has rapidly emerged in America and elsewhere (see next page). It has the features of a long-odds sports bet. For a small outlay a call option can pay off handsomely if the stock price suddenly surges. If not, the option expires, worthless, like many a bucket-shop bet.There are two sides to a market, of course. The specialist traders and hedge funds on the other side of these trades are content to take the premiums from options buyers and to manage the risks of occasional big losses should the punters‚Äô bets pay off. One hedge for a call option is simply to own the stock, which is why long-only equity funds are increasingly being drawn into the market to juice up their returns. ‚ÄúA lot depends on your book,‚Äù says a seasoned options trader. If you‚Äôve taken in a lot of put-option premiums, you might write some call options to even things out. Or you could balance the risk from an expensive-looking option‚Äîwith, say, a round-number strike price of the kind favoured by retail investors‚Äîusing a cheaper-looking option with a nearby strike price.This new wave of options trading seems unlikely to recede. Technology has made access to financial markets ever easier for small investors. Equity options are like bucket-shop bets. Institutional investors are increasingly being drawn in to act as bookmakers. One way or another, everybody is an options trader now.‚Äù

I mean a slow squeeze is good too, look at what happened to Tesla.
This is what people don‚Äôt understand. Exactly this. This is a team effort not just a one man show. The people at Tesla and SpaceX and the culture at the places is what people are betting on.
What a time to be alive, GME and BB once beacons of boomerism are soaring, Tesla is worth more than every car manufacturer in existence and now, the Germans can‚Äôt make cars.
Jesus,  looking at the GME thread today was the highlight of my day. True handicaps over there but anywayz, Tesla $900 EOW.
It might be like Tesla, a long squeeze, as a result of their shitty scheming, a year of strong days.  Maybe this is better for Cohen's turnaround efforts so the mainstream has time to get on board, instead of thinking it's some pump and dump.  I'm not selling either way.
What the hell is "tesla" and why is it not GameStop?
Go watch DFV‚Äôs live stream. He just said GME is the next apple and Tesla. YouTube: Roaring Kitty GME üöÄüöÄüöÄüåï
I hate to say it guys but Elon will never fuck with GME or Citron, he is a ripe target for the SEC and that could cause him and Tesla more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. INB4 ‚Äúwell citron manipulates the market and the SEC doesn‚Äôt care‚Äù well that‚Äôs because Shitron and the SEC are in bed together. Elon is a red pilled big shlong billionaire and you bet the SEC would love to tap him.
Palantir  is going to the fucking Pluto.  This is the amazon, apple, Microsoft, google, tesla stock you missed out on.  This will be a $500 billion dollar company very soon just based on the potential big data market.  Get your DD wet before it's to late.   I am buying 4,500 shares :)
Tesla subs back in the day where saying set stupidly high limit orders on your shares because then under sec rules they cannot be lent out.
Sold everything I had but tesla and ICLN, put it all in GME to get to 270 shares and had exactly $69.69 buying power left. This makes me extremely bullish, I‚Äôll see u all in valhalla
i have 45 shares at a avg of $32... i‚Äôm thinking maybe a Tesla Cybertruck would look nice in my driveway.

Is gme going to get retarded Tesla levels of momentum where every time it drops everyone is just going to buy it before it goes down really low and it just keeps shooting to the moon?!
Selling Tesla I've held since June to double down again on GMEFuck Shitron, it's the only way they'll learn
Possibly a cold take but from a purely social perspective the idea of shorting is really bothering. Why would you want something like Gamestop or Tesla that add real value to peoples lives to fail? It would be so much cooler if these big institutions put their money into supporting companies that we would all benefit from.
The same program that lent to Solyndra also provided a $465 million loan to Tesla in 2010. That was an unimaginably good investment. The whole point of these programs is to provide access to finance to higher risk/higher reward companies, and incentivize innovation in priority sectors. Additionally, the DOE loan program as a whole is profitable, even considering some high profile losses like Solyndra and Fisker.

Looking at buying BB and GME to help the cause. I‚Äôve got $1k waiting to hit. Then another 4K coming next week. Should I sell my Tesla and buy stocks now?
Stop expecting an instant and giganormous squeeze. Tesla stonk got massively shorted and see what happened? It rose to heights not achievable by just people buying its stonks. Same is likely here. Just a continuous uptrend for a really long time.
AND the dude she was basically married to (Alan Salzman) was an early investor in Tesla and is a multi-billionaire whereas Andrew Left shorted Tesla and lost a shit ton of money.  It's amazing.
Do something Tesla wtf is side way trading shit. All the calls are dying
Here's a magic trick: I'm gonna turn my Tesla into GME!
The people who are talking shit about $BB are the ones who stood around when Apple and Tesla boomed. Buy BB and hold, guaranteed profits. Amazon partnership, fb settlement, ev business with almost every ev company using BB‚Äôs technology. Possibilities are endless, don‚Äôt get left behind üöÄüöÄüöÄ BB
Tesla would have to go to 5k in order to return what GME will return this year. 50k with the squeeze lmao
Just sold my Tesla to pump in.
For all the sellers: I'm gonna fuck your bitch in my Tesla while we drive down the highway to tendie town.
I used to be a licensed broker on the active trader team @ Schwab.Fully marginable shares at Schwab have a 30% maintenance requirement. Think basic stuff like Apple, Walmart, Visa. Stocks you won't see swing too wildly in price. Other stocks with more volatility, such as Tesla, have a 65% maintenance requirement.Maintenance requirement means the amount of your investment you need to *personally own.* I can sit on $100,000 in Apple stock (and realize the gains of 100k of apple) that I only had $30,000 to pay for. Schwab would front me the other $70,000, if I had appropriate collateral in my account. Keep in mind if it drops by a penny, I'm now in a maintenance call.Anyway, because of GME's recently crazy volatility, they bumped the maintenance requirement to 200%. If I have $10k in GME, not only do I need to own those shares outright, it's going to eat into another $10k off of the rest of my marginable securities, forcing me to have more equity in my account. Schwab also put a 200% maint req on Kodak when that crazy bullshit was going on.
Hack your wife‚Äôs boyfriends RH and sell his Tesla shares for GME
I can‚Äôt wait for the day tesla gets readjusted, it‚Äôs gonna be loss porn all over this sub.Nothing in Tesla is organic
Shitron says they know a lot more about shorting.Is that why you shorted Tesla, üçã?
Well, comes down to this. Which you find more likely?\- Tesla 2x with 795B market cap = to USD 1590B market cap\- BB 2x with 7B market cap = USD 14B market cap
We're going to climb over this mountain. Just like how we climbed NIO. like how we climbed PLTR. like how we climbed Tesla. Sell now and miss your chance. Do you want to re-live not getting in those stocks? Trust, GME we trust
Keep holding, retard. We might have a huge VW style spike, or we might have a huge year long melt up alarm Tesla.
I have 38 shares of Tesla to ditch and switch to GME. üò≥üò¨ it‚Äôs a hard switch to make tho

Should I sell my $28 in tesla to buy a whole share of gme?
Remember when Tesla was the number 1 shorted company and two years later it was at 840$ AFTER a stock split?... GME to $420.69
Motley told me to buy Tesla last year. And Square. Shopify. They arent shitron.
To the new guys, and the absolute pussies, you need to get used to this thing swinging between 35-45. It‚Äôs a constant battle between retards and shorts and sometimes it‚Äôll go either way. The most important thing is that you don‚Äôt panic sell on any of these swings, they‚Äôll be irrelevant once you‚Äôre sipping Tesla Tequila on the moon.To the rest of you legends, keep up the good work üôåüèºüíé
All I gotta say about Tesla is when Apple was worth the same as them 2-3 years ago apple made more money in profits than Tesla makes in revenue rn
How retarded would it be to sell a tesla share and dump it all into BB? I have nothing but love for daddy elon, the steady gains he has given me got me to the party. Given the amount TSLA has increased in the last year it seems like maybe the best play is to yolo it into something like blackberry
Fuck I never felt so confident in a company I sold some of my Teslas. Fuck that hurts I ducking love Tesla but GME has too much potential.
Remember when these same boomers told us not to buy Tesla?  ü•úü•úü•úüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Elon should place a huge buy and assist us in taking down the same people shorting tesla. A win here could send the entire market flying
Sold my share of tesla and bought 19 more. I am officially deeper than comfortable with. üíé üôåüöÄ
Ask the guy who turned 1 Tesla contract that cost him 354 dollars that‚Äôs worth over a million dollars today when to sell
All I'm saying is that before Tesla took off people were saying similiar things, like them not being able to beat the competition from the legacy auto makers and so on. Also how do you know that Gme can't establish a high growth business model under Ryan Cohen? And that physical product is the place to be? Look at amazon
sold my share of tesla for this buy the dips you fucking tards
Who the fuck is selling?Selling GME now is the same as selling TESLA at 7$!
next tesla? damn B i dont think so
Breaking: Tesla and GameStop partnering to create a VR alternate reality  removing you from the physical world and sending you to a digital utopia where you can live like a king happily ever after. Bullish.
Is gme more of a meme then tesla? We legit have our own circle jerk chat
His ex-wife got fucked by a Tesla investor. Then she died.Forever cucked.
If something fucky goes down with Reddit/RH/ToS etc., this is the last directive:HOLD. Don't take profits until your life has been changed, and even then let's make GME the next Tesla/Amazon/Apple/Chewy.
Trust me. Get in while you can. I'm not hyping this up but based on how scared the shorter are right now... we're going to see another tesla growth
Elon: sell Tesla to fund this rocket.
HOLY SHIT I JUST PUT ALL MY TESLA GAINS IN GME MY HEART IS SINKING TESLA IS LITERALLY HALF MY PORTFOLIO AND IM 20 KILL ME
Should I sell my tesla equity and dump it into gme until the peak?
Citron‚Äôs short claim today further proves that GME is the stock to buy. As I‚Äôm saying this I‚Äôm putting in orders to buy more shares. This company has way too many similarities to how Tesla rose from its start. Guys buy shares and don‚Äôt get burn by calls. This play is going to take time and patience but I‚Äôm so fucking sure this is gonna pay out big af.
i swear this is like post battery day for tesla. paper hands sold and it crashed and then it mooned üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I‚Äôm a retard so I just sold my Tesla stock for more GME

But being so invested in the performance of the stock.  At least they should be forced to reveal their positions if they are making such comments. Atleast that's what an honest straight journalist would do. "I have tesla, I'm invested in tesla, I want tesla stock to increase and I'm biased towards tesla. With that in mind, here is why I think tesla is the best buy of 2021". As opposed to "tesla is awesome and you should buy it" oh BTW I have $100 million invested and plan to pump and dump this stock.
Was ur portfolio just Tesla? I would have held TSLA but if its the only stock you have, then yea dump TSLA and all in GME.
All my Tesla btw
Papa Elon forgive me, for today I donate not to the church of Tesla, but the Temple of Gamestop.
Y'all paperhanding idiots fail to realise Citron shorted TESLA, NIO, PTON, PLTR, NVIDIA.
sold my tesla shares for a loss to put into gme
I took money out of tesla to buy gme at 44 not like this. Strong together
Tesla stock is already priced in.  Until they start mass producing their solar tiles, I don't see the stock moving higher.  There are stocks with high growth other than tesla on the market.
Aren't these the people who said to sell tesla and nio 6 months ago?
Citron said it was short Tesla. How‚Äôd that work out for them? Don‚Äôt get scared off, we have the power here.

If you win the mega millions (850 million):After taxes you‚Äôll have approximately 535 million. With 535 million, paying $830/ share you can own approximately 645,180 shares of Tesla. Making you the second largest individual investor to Tesla‚Äî next to Poppa Musk. Or  you can buy out 20% of GME üò≥
Bears are out here right now downvoting every possible bullish post they see. Sorry you lost your life savings shorting Tesla and SPY last year. You'll be okay gay bear.
I haven‚Äôt even made it to 26k yet... I used to freak out being down 1k but that‚Äôs because the $3500 I‚Äôve deposited is the most money I‚Äôve ever had at one time in my life. But after watching my account go from 2k to 15k back down 4k when I discovered WSB and Tesla options around the time of the split, I‚Äôm pretty sure that if I had 200k+ in an account, going down 26k in a day wouldn‚Äôt phase me. Although if I had 200k I‚Äôd buy a house and save maybe 20k for my account. And I will, after the GME squeeze.
Honestly, with Tesla being an American company, I think that model simply isn't viewed favorably by Americans.For example, the idea that I would swap batteries with someone else is not one I like.  Did the last person damage the battery and now I'll get blamed?  Did the last person mess up the battery and now I'll be stuck when this damaged batter fails?  Did someone shit on these batteries and now my car smells like shit?  As an American, I can vouch that American are savage as fuck.That doesn't mean having your own batteries is better, it just might explain why Tesla doesn't use them.
Ok so last week I surpassed my all time high (since I joined WSB/the market 2+ years ago) and I‚Äôve been riding a huge high. Bought a pretty high end pc and drank expensive Mo√´t.Just wanna say shout out to the OGs of this sub for all the lessons I learned. Mattress king, Oil Baron, Sue Bae masochist, Weed/Tesla bros, etcLet‚Äôs get this fucking bread bwoys. And remember when you lose racks, there‚Äôs a lesson to be learned.
But why did Tesla abandon the swap idea? That‚Äôs my concern. Battery warranty, getting a badly worn battery, etc. All very difficult to deal with.

I remember reading Tesla people would put in super duper high sell limit orders at like $60000 and that would mean that the broker couldn't use the shares for themselves. Sounds like something similar. If you own the shares GME and don't have a limit sell order in, then the broker can use them.
Tesla. No brainer.
Move to America, download Robinhood, tesla/GME weekly calls.
I'll update everyone with pictures of my Tesla S and my streaming mansion with all my boys. Coming soon.
what the hell is this place? I see no $GME at all and an upvoted post of a guy buying Tesla puts
Y‚Äôall ever feel sad for people that come on here to try to spread negativity about assets that have exponentially mooned? (Tesla, Game, etc) that were clearly told to buy? That it‚Äôs so obvious their friends or someone they know clearly struck it big and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre so salty? That seeing it come down would give them more joy than jumping on and buying a ticket for the ride? (They won‚Äôt come down keep wishing you pathetic shit) How fucking sad are people that are like that? Nothing good ever happens in the lives of people with mentalities like that. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre apes with how salty they get.
selling ~120 tesla shares to buy ~2500 shares of gme at Tuesday open
Why do you think Dr. Burry shorted Tesla haha. He was right in financial crisis, he was right about GME and will he be right about TESLA? who knows. But he was right in a awful lot of things.
$150? Not good enough. Squeeze harder.I want to have my tendies in fucking orbit, tesla 2.0 style, rewrite this you autist and fix it
Okay... How should I put this, with all the hype the price doubled within days. Now there's more hype, and ppl are expecting this is hit $100, maybe two hundred optimistically. There are others who believe this is the next tesla that's going to 10x or more. So potentially the stocks may hit $500-1000 this can take years. There's also out who will ride this hype, and make some short term gains. So you're risking under $100, if you got some money you feel like gambling, it's your choice.
Fuck I sold my Tesla for GME can you buy stocks on a credit card?
He felt Tesla was just too gourd to be true
Lol who the fuck invests in gourds, was Tesla stock just too mainstream?
Fuck the CCP for trying to make WSB a Nio Cult.This has been a Tesla Cult for months now.
GME 3000$ shares. This is the new tesla
Bro, have you seen what the analysts said about Tesla?
Its Tesla you paper handed retard.
Tesla is unlikely to increase and is in a bubble which will pop. Leave your initial investment in Tesla and take your profits to game, also consider diversifying further.
That's the crazy thing, can't ever take a loss on a Tesla option, hold it till the last minute and pray Elon  creates a meme and that shit will soar
Tell Biden to get that tesla stimy out sooner
Market closed Monday, theta is the only thing working that day.This play is in trouble, I don't know that there is enough of a catalyst this week. Elon is capable of anything, so maybe. Experience tells me you'll be lucky to keep the equity you have, but again, Tesla is not one to ever bet against.
Didn't tesla just uploaded that million mile battery video on their YouTube channel?
Lmao even if Tesla is 870 ur not making money lmao, you realize atm calls right now is like $20, while ur overinflated shit is is averaging $40 üòÇ
Bruh we all dumped our tesla positions for GME I got called a retard by my friends and family for it and everything
Well Tesla posted a new video , one tweet from elon and you will be up 200%
I'm not executing my 10 contracts, I will sell them, break even price does not matter then. As long as tesla is around 855-865, I will make money. If it's 870+ u bet ur ass I will lick elon's ass dry
For anyone wondering, I went in 20k at $40 and 11k at $34, I do not have fuck you money, however I do have a job that allows me to be a bit bold. I will not be so careless next time and do more research.... UNLESS TESLA GOES APE SHIT MONDAY TO FRIDAY LOLOLOLOL
It was a week for GME and BB and you decide to go with Tesla.
These will print when Tesla at 900 next week
specially for batteries. It looks like Tesla is going to manufacture every EV battery in the market.
I am bullish too, but nearing retirement I've had my fill and am currently de-risking. I did something I've never done before when the market crashed this March: changed my target stock/bond allocation. I went from 30% equities to 60%...after living through QE I figured the fed was going to prop up markets. Very happy with how 2020 turned out as a result.With that said...I'm working on scaling back risk. Cashed out some VTI this month and back at 50% bonds (mix of stable value, I bonds, CDs I bought before rates went to hell, ee bonds, and high yields..).I shifted nearly 2/3 of my stocks to international and emerging market ETFs around Q3/Q4. I'm still buying US stocks but only looking at a few select sectors that aren't overvalued: utilities, natural gas pipelines, Reits, defense, tobacco. I still have like 7% of my portfolio in VTI and I'm planning to sell that off in a few months and split it between munis and dividend stocks. My sell signal is Tesla at 1000. :)
Priced in linearly, so if Tesla set sales target at 1 million, expect SP to doubleIt literally cannot go tits up
I started with 225 bucks, a 2% increase on that a year ain‚Äôt getting me nowhere. Big money, big plays. I‚Äôm driving a Tesla by summer.

BB qnx will be in tesla too. Tesla‚Äôs ubuntu os is not secure and automotive security regs are going to require a tsla overhaul. Just watch.
No I only had a few Tesla pre split. I keep that one for nostalgia. I made a lot early 2020 on dkng and nkla early when I though people would jump on it because of its name when it merged. Didn‚Äôt know it was a scam ü§£ then other spacs. Started getting in Gme in June with options.
Bb qnx will be in every Ev car outside of tesla. This is EV play with no valuation on EV sales and growth.
But did you see his share of tesla?
I just wanna know why you only have 1 tesla stock.  Papa Elon rolling in his grave.
The extent to which the disconnect can reach is unbelievable. Some people here prefer to pretend Ark's model is to invest on hype and dump stocks afterwards, while Ark was publicly analyzing their conviction in all these companies and innovation platforms for years, and getting laughed at. They have been openly supporting their view that Tesla will reach $4k (pre split) by 2024 when Tesla was trading at $200 and getting ridiculed about it for years, until everyone started waking up and joining the bandwagon in 2020. And now instead of finally acknowledging how amazingly insightful Cathie Wood and their team was and is, people are trying to twist things completely and attribute Ark's success to bullshit reasons. Wake up you sheep.
In short:üåàüß∏ relies on retail investors being üìÑ‚úã for their market manipulations to work.A growing number of retail investors are üíéüôå and buying the dip.Ask the Tesla shorts how relying on üìÑ‚úã retail investors worked out.
GME set aside a *dollar* amount that they could raise from selling stock, not a number of shares. They wouldn't get any more money from selling shares at a higher price. That being said, they CERTAINLY would rather sell at a higher price because like /u/r34p3rex said below, getting their money out of stock when the stock is trading higher dilutes the shares FAR less, and would have a much lower impact on the share price. Basically the ideal time to do it would be when the company needs money, but the share price is artifically way too high. Kinda like when Tesla offered a bunch of shares. They really needed the money but it didn't hurt their share price at all because they were already trading at like 2500x P/E.
I can see GME being more valuable than Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Facebook and Microsoft COMBINED. Ill post a DD later.
I keep seeing comments that they are working with Tesla but have yet to see any proof. One kind redditor was able to show proof that they are working with SpaceX though which is promising.
&gtIt took months for the dotcom bubble to fully crash, and investors had countless opportunities to cash out after a 5, 10, and even 20% drawdown from the peak. 90% crashes don‚Äôt happen overnight. The problem is that there‚Äôs no clear way of knowing the difference between the bubble popping and a temporary dip until after the fact. For example, say I own Tesla stock, and it drops 10%. Do I sell? It could be the start of a bigger crash, or it could just be a minor dip and it will go up more in the figure. It‚Äôs not easy to say which it is.
And why does elon musk use QNX realtime os for spacex falcon instead of a tesla product/software? I think there is much room that BB will cooperate with tesla in the future models.
A couple of quotes regarding the Tesla short squeeze, which I think mirrors the GME squeeze more than VW does:It‚Äôs not short-sellers covering their positions that‚Äôs been driving up Tesla‚Äôs stock price, according to Mark Spiegel, who runs a small hedge fund that‚Äôs short the company. But he does have other suspicions.‚ÄúSome entity ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know who ‚Äî was executing a strategy of buying massive quantities of out-of-the-money call options,‚Äù forcing call-option sellers to buy enough stock to hedge their exposure, Spiegel, founder of hedge fund firm Stanphyl Capital Partners, suggested by phone. ‚ÄúThis thing just kind of spiraled its way up.‚ÄùAnother driver has been widespread enthusiasm among individual investors buying Tesla shares this year through trading apps like Robinhood, according to Spiegel. ‚ÄúThere was this whole gambling mentality that took place,‚Äù he says.
Veterans of the Tesla, Tilray and Beyond Meat squeezes know this is the truth. The difference here is the short % is much higher. The volatility (up and down) should also be higher on GME going forward. This means the tendies will be fatter once were done.
+1Banking on a squeeze on Tuesday or even next week is retarded. It could happen, but I'd be happier myself seeing the squeeze dragging out over months, Tesla style, which is a very possible scenario given the firepower on both sides. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

For maximum tendies, I'm üíé‚úãüèøü§öüèøuntil it hits 694.20, 420.69 is just too low of PT.  RC isn't a corporate raider like Icahn that just wants a quick 3X.  He took years off after Petsmart bought him out to find his next passion project.  In the meantime, he took his billions and yolo'd it into 3 stocks, Apple, Wells Fargo and Tesla.  He's one of us.
Pretty great! I started at $5,000, it's now $13,350. Mostly from Tesla and other meme stock DDs from this sub. I've never seen a greater and more supportive community, I love you guys.
So, you‚Äôre not gonna find them, OK.The guy that turned a $1500 TSLA LEAPS into $3M made it because TSLA was trading sideways for like 3 years, before this year long run. IV was probably stupid low.Now that shit just explodes everywhere, good luck finding a ticker that:* Is a well-known, well-understood company* Has a lot of upside potential* Is not a meme stock* People are not buying options left and right* Is not a penny/cheap stock* Has options* Did not jump 100% in a month* Traded sideways for months, at leastTesla was all this in 2019. Find another company like this, and you‚Äôll find your cheap and yet somehow amazingly profitable LEAPS.Therein lies the problem - such a company pretty much doesn‚Äôt exist today, because we‚Äôre in a bubble and everything‚Äôs hot. I‚Äôm not saying bubble‚Äôs popping any time soon, but it‚Äôs making options expensive on average.
Best Buy has a market cap of $27 billion and $49 billion annual revenue. GameStop currently has a market cap of 2 billion with 6-8 billion revenues yearly (but their online sales since Cohen hopped on board are up 309%) on fundamentals alone, cutting fat by closing stores, their excellent balance sheet this stock should double from here. Ryan Cohen to me is like Lebron James going to the LA Lakers. The lakers had zero hope, it was a questionable decision but after a year it paid off and the lakers came back during his sophomore season and won the title. Proving every single doubter and üåàüêª wrong. Any company worth its salt is only as good as the CEO. Ryan Cohens don‚Äôt grow on trees. If Elon Musk left Tesla evaluation would immediately drop. It‚Äôs like when Jobs passed away &amp then Tim Cook took over. We saw a dip. (And you can bet your ass Jobs would be doing a way better job than Tim Apple) Either way. GameStop just picked up a hot fresh talented brilliant CEO who went up against Amazon in direct competition &amp Succeeded. I‚Äôm fully sold and I wish I had been on board sooner. It‚Äôs seriously so clear to me now.
Just bought 30 shares fo GME. And I have only ever invested in Tesla before this but I hate people who short stocks so this is a fight I want to be a part of.
They got a house and it sounds like that's it, off of tesla gains, so probably
I think it's just a benchmark ratio.How does thing a compare at different points to thing b.Both operate in the economy and are subject to internal and external factors.We all know that the stock market is over valued. Looking at you tesla and palantir(disclosure, I own some just so I can be part of the club)
This is the dream. Too bad I joined the game well after Tesla took off
Yeah this is really just a ‚Äúhow I got lucky with Tesla‚Äù story
That's nice but how does that ? Are you saying we should buy Tesla 5 years ago?
Yeah people get pissed off when I suggest Sony I don‚Äôt know why. Winning the console war and an ev The car looks better than Tesla too. They‚Äôre only trying to sell parts though
Selling 21 tesla 200 nio for bb Tuesday. Moved another 6k into account for bb.to. playing both currencies.  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Seriously the role of options is being ignored, when me or you buy an option the writer hedges their position by buying shares this pushes the price to infinity and beyond, you can look at tesla and match the stock rising with the options volume, kinda scary tbh
Just buy ARKK and go short on tesla at the same time. Boom, ARKK minus tesla. What could go wrong?/s (just in case)Seriously though, if you feel uncomfortable about TSLA but like the rest of ARKK's portfolio, it probably just means you aren't informed enough about the other holdings to be worried about them too - because if her process led her to favor TSLA above all others, it's really the process you should be uncomfortable with... Not just that one stock.
Well I sure hope it goes to up and surpasses that Tesla car in space.
If you bought equal parts k, g, and f, you‚Äôd have 3% Tesla.  Probably an appropriate amount of a top 5 company by size in the country.
Her genomic and fintech fund do not have Tesla
You're looking at this the wrong way. It doesn't need to last forever.  The entire ARK strategy is based around identifying innovative companies early and investing to benefit from the massive growth as they disrupt the market.  You say \*she's just benefitting from the hype\* but the potential value of future growth of a growing company getting priced in is a natural part of a company's life cycle.  If she identifies them early and gets in, and hype grows, her investment grows ,and as the company matures, she exits and invests in other new innovative companies.Yes, Tesla and all these companies will face a correction as they settle into normal business.  Her strategy doesn't involve staying in these companies forever at that point.Whether that makes her \*the Warren Buffet\* of investing or not I guess is a matter of philosophy.  That's not Buffet's strategy of value investing, but I'm not so sure that's what OP cares about.
Currently too reliant on tesla
Do it retard. I'm about to sell my Tesla...
What a dumb take. You don't think Tesla will survive because of the interior of the cars? This is why I'm convinced nobody's opinion on the internet about Tesla (good or bad) is worth anything. People absolutely love Tesla interiors. Go hop on Instagram or talk to 10 random people who have seen the inside of the Tesla, they love them. The only people that complain about the quality of the interior are broke /r/cars enthusiasts who wants an all leather stitched brown diesel manual station wagon used from the factory.Tesla could very well face shortcomings, but the interior is the dumbest reason I've ever heard of.
Ive seen a Tesla with WSB plates. I cant wait till someone shares a picture of their yacht. This sub will be very dangerous if this thing takes off. Looking forward to the future.
QCLN is ~9% Tesla so if you want to avoid stocks with PE ratios of 1,700, you'd pick ICLN.There's also TAN. They all basically track the same.
He prob has other sources of income and believes in tesla so much and it will pay off in a few years
That‚Äôs exactly my point. Tesla has failed to generate any significant cash flow (will they in the future, no one knows) to justify their current valuation. She‚Äôs just made money off the hype.
she‚Äôs been invested in tesla for YEARS it‚Äôs only become a momentum trade now that everyone realized what she‚Äôs been saying for years
I agree, even as a big shareholder of TSLA myself.It's scary seeing some people on the Tesla investor sub bragging about how they are smarter than everyone on Wall Street because they took out loans and re-mortgaged their houses to buy TSLA back in 2018. The stock may very well keep going up, but *if* the music stops, a lot of people will be in very bad places.
Ron Baron - one of the biggest investors in Tesla,here he is explaining Teslas big future 1 year ago - before the big run[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QJlTMADGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QJlTMADGQ)
My man's gonna hold tesla till his grave, never even gonna spend a dime...
Warren Buffett is a value investor, when it comes to tech I believe you should be looking at investing in disruptive companies who change the way different industries do business. And as other comments, Cathy Woods' ARK ETF covers lots of disruptive companies and she has been correct in her estimates, thus far. For example, she was a big proponent of Tesla before most didn't have TESLA in their portfolio. She proved lot of people wrong. She advocated SQUARE, ILLUMINA, LEMONADE. All of them have been growing successfully.
We lost it when Tik Tok girls started pumping Tesla
When I made this comment I was unaware that he made a couple billion on Tesla this year. I wasn‚Äôt sure what kind of bankroll he was working with. I agree it‚Äôs a steal.
That doesn‚Äôt counter what I‚Äôm saying. I like Tesla as a company (not crazy about them being a conglomerate, wish they‚Äôd split up), but they‚Äôre selling cars at a loss if you remove the carbon credits. If they can make cars at $25k, that‚Äôs awesome. It also means the higher end cars will likely come down too. But it still doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre making profits on their cars.
&gtThe Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with a low ability of a given task are prone to overestimate their ability at that task.Ironically this is incorrect. I know that this is also the common explanation (which is even more ironic) because it is not accurate to what the [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Unskilled-and-unaware-of-it%3A-how-difficulties-in-to-Kruger-Dunning/f2c80eef3585e0569e93ace0b9770cf76c8ebabc?p2df) reads.The Dunning-Krueger Effect is better understood to be a simple failure of metacognition. In short-hand: "You don't know that you don't know something and you can't realize that you don't know it." Overconfidence is a side-effect but not actually the effect itself self-assessment typically is overdrawn but the parabolic effect isn't as "outlandish" as popular media makes it out to be for instance people who are just starting with options might say, "I understand the greeks" but then turn around and ask something that requires you to understand the greeks *but* that shouldn't be mistaken for the idea that people simply fail to understand that they *don't* know everything about options, hence the question to begin with, etc.[You are more likely to suffer Illusory Depth](https://ritholtz.com/2019/08/the-illusion-of-explanatory-depth/?utm_source=feedburner&amputm_medium=feed&amputm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheBigPicture+%28The+Big+Picture%29) in this particular case of investing in a "wild" market. Also, I would not consider this a "bull" market in the traditional sense the number of winners and losers last year (that is, companies that literally no longer exist, not just companies that lost value) is astronomical what happened with bonds and liquidity functions of other assets and such is not equivalent to a normal and steady rise in valuation over time at all. That's why there are so many saying, "The Second Coming" is coming for a fall out and honestly they might be right with the dollar being forcibly devalued. How long can that truly last? We don't know. We've never done this before in history. Which is ironic because again to understand these effects (this is a close cousin of DK) you'll make up stories as to why things occurred. What this means is also you can create [Economic Narratives](https://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Economics-Stories-Economic-Events/dp/0691182299) which turn out to be exactly what drives a series of interesting effects.We can actually prove this let's take for instance the Gamestop situation. So first we have "the initial buyers", like DeepFuckingValue, now the question is simple: Did he know that Gamestop would rebrand and Ryan Cohen would take interest almost a year and a half before it happened? No. So then, that begs another question did the short-squeeze itself warrant these prices? No. Now, of course, in the history of the world we will write that *he did* and that there was no difference between the events that occurred and his state simply because it all rolls into itself very nicely (hence Illusory Depth with Narrative) into a clean story.The reality is that there are people who make bets like this all the time *and lose* but we don't remember them. Another good story is the Ambulance driver who made a million percent or something in that same thread there was a guy whose calls expired *one week too early* and do you know what? I remember the Ambulance Driver. I don't remember the other guy.We can say the same of Tesla everyone has an explanation as to why Tesla soared *after the fact* but no one expected this to occur in a single year and anyone who gives an explanation of it is practically lying through their teeth since the story itself of clean energy is 40 years old. There are many, many examples where things went sideways, make no sense, will be explained after the fact, or are just flat out garbage that people will buy into because they see the ticker and know that it will rise regardless of it's actual viability.TLDR: **The greatest threat to you in this market are the stories you tell yourself not the knowledge base you think you have.**
You deleted your WHOLE post when I pointed out markets are closed on Monday and you claimed Tesla $900 EOD on Monday. How am I supposed to follow your advice if you pussy out and delete whole posts on something as simple as that...
I love it but would like to add a few things that no one seems to ever mention which I feel is huge. Sandwiched in the investor presentation Palantir mentioned...The federal government has a law that they cannot stop use of an entity or service that is to their benefit, to try and create something of their own.Meaning unless someone else comes along and does Palantir better than Palantir, the government by law cannot replace Palantir. They have to stay with them because it provides them a benefit. Palantir SUED the government for this, and won.In my eyes all of the R&ampD expense is no different than Amazon or Tesla reinvesting in building their foundation.This is huge and in my eyes pretty much locks Palantir in to the government. The real combo breaker will be if they can create a new product with a low overhead and lower price point, that can appeal to the masses. Like the Model 3.
OP is adorable but there is no way 1.8 million autists are going to have the discipline of a single entity like Porsche.Like a lot of "reasonable" people I sold 1/2 at 130% gain and will let the other 1/2 ride because it's all profit. I did the same thing with Tesla. I did my part, my original investment got paid to me directly out of the pocket of shorts and now the rest of it is out there long so there may be a secondary squeeze if and when lord cohen can make this thing viable.
This MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in 2020.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s ratio of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  This isn‚Äôt even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  The digital game sales argument, like all üêª  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the üêª are right, but they‚Äôre right in 8 years which means they‚Äôre wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels and morepeople go back to stores.  Also, game publishers don‚Äôt care about the fractionallylarger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical.  Look at how many Red Box locations still exist.  Blockbuster died because CarlIcahn got involved, killedBlockbuster‚Äôs attempt to pivot to a Netflix model and Blockbuster‚Äôs old business model relied on late fees.  Red box offered the same thing as blockbuster in a consumer friendlier format.I could post more and make this a deviated post but I‚Äôm too fucking lazy.  This has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next chewy, you‚Äôre looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don‚Äôt attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  TLDR:  30k shares at $32 cost basis.  Thing will moon and continue to moon if you believe in RC.
If you've watched Tesla for long enough you start to realize how blatantly fake all the news is and the analyst are fucking retarded.  That cramer video explains it all.
‚ÄúI suspect that by Friday we are looking at maybe as high as $1300 which will result in a second stock split‚ÄùStfu you legit know absolutely nothing, making up fake targets and fake scenarios to try and help your calls.  Go read a few posts back the Dunning Kruger effect.I‚Äôm long Tesla, have hella shares, and very optimistic, but you‚Äôre just retarded.
When COVID hit, my husband, who is an Audio Engineer, lost his job immediately. Can't keep working when there are no shows or conferences to set up and run audio for! He was making 6 figures a year, and it hit us. Luckily, I work at a great job as well. UI where we are was paying 820/week at the beginning, but when it went down end of July, he went out and got a job. (Granted he was staying home and taking care of our 3 littles while he was home up until July. Which was fun with school online and all) He is now putting solar panels on roofs for Tesla. Definitely not his dream job, and not where he thought he would be. However, we are so grateful. We have a roof over our heads, none of us have gotten COVID, and he has a job. He still keeps in touch with contacts and stays up to date on all audio items, because we know that this is a phase, and this too shall pass. All in all, stay positive. Even if you have to go home, you have a home to go to. You have the ability to go out and get another job, even if it is not where you are going to be when a new 'normal' is found. You got this!!!!!
Bro, I'll stop fucking your wife if Tesla hits 1300 soon.
Tesla options have always been notoriously expensive, I remember looking at them years ago (like 2016-ish) and being shocked at the premium. There is absolutely zero possibility he picked up those 10 contracts for 1.55, 15 months out, at 110% above the spot. I could maybe believe 15.5 but 1.55 is a fantasy.
Yeah wtf. I've seen the interviews, they even made elon cry!? Wtf just because he actually does stuff and works hard to fulfill his dreams. They will erect statues of him in 50 years. He will send people to mars. Its his goal. Tesla is part of this endeavour
&gtFirst stage is denial and ridicule.Sort of like the ridicule from institutions about Tesla, mocking Elon's personality.
Serious question.How many people read Seeking Alpha 's articles?They get publicized in investing.com and a lot of other sites.And why a definitely-biased-article is any different from a definitely-biased-post?Both are written by somebody who calls himself an analyst (in WSB it means he likes receiving anal, though).Both gives read on the situation of a stock, its management and gives a conclusion that can be translated as "it may go up" "it may go down".If somebody follow up and buy a stock, why is this a problem?In the same discussion, if somebody on Twitter with a lot of followers said "Tesla is overpriced IMHO" and the stock tanked because a lot of people believed what this person said, why is that a problem?
The fuck you saying? Tesla was Tesla already in 2019.
Wallstreet: Blackberry is an phone company that sells phones just like Tesla is an car company selling carsWsb: Blackberry is an security software company that sells endpoint security software that sells at an PE ratio of 6 end of this year!
&gt His bet was the stock would increase appx 270% to reach the $690 strike.Your math is way fucking off. Oct 25th, 2019 the price was $328. He only needed 110% to hit his strike price.In the 4 months preceding his 'purchase', Tesla had already gone up 77% from $185 to $328. It was still one of the most volatile stocks. No fucking way he got those contracts for that price.
Tesla was still a meme back then. Remember Elon's "gonna take Tesla private at $420" tweet? In the 15 months preceding OPs so called bet, Tesla went from $250 to $370 to below $200. It still had crazy IV. No way he got the contracts for that price.
Tesla bout to POP OFF next week
1 year ago tesla did not have low IV.its been a memaggedon stock for the last 2-3 years.
This was bought before Tesla became the meme juggernaut. The Cybertruck and everything after made Tesla IV ridiculous ever since.
He means no one is going to sell their shares in masses like you retards think. It doesn't make sense to if you're highly invested in the success of the company. Why would you sell your shit at 25 dollars a share if you know your company will be worth 300 dollars a share in 2-3 years. The answer is you don't unless you're a retard like the retards here. At least that's what I think he means. Look at Tesla, no one ever sells their fucking shares and it just goes up and up and up.
2 years ago when people thought Tesla would go bankrupt
If I fucking knew, I would have bought Tesla at the start of 2020.
God speed fellow retardtorian.. I'm in for $600 @9.98 x5 until tesla gets back to upper 800s so I can get my $ out of there.. then NOK and BB next week üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
What the fuck happened? Buy a Tesla call yesterday at close?
Morbid curiosity, how involved in Tesla stock were you during October of 2019 when he bought these calls?
I work as a teller at a bank and today this old ugly boomer came in to deposit a 1.6M check from his brokerage, bragging about just buying his second Tesla. He then told me he bought 2000 shares pre split. God I hate stupid boomers why not just YOLO leaps
Yup. It's no different then if you saw a nice lambo at the lambo store but are a poor autist who can't buy it.  The snake-- I mean sales man-- thinks oh shit this poor wage slave can't buy this so let me tell him that if he pays me $50 and can come up with $125k in cash by the end of the week I'll sell it to him at that price. He pockets the $50 and you now have a purchase option at that price point before expiration. If suddenly all the lambos in the world drove off a cliff and demand came back then you could go and throw $125k and get the lambo and then laugh in the salesman's face.It's no different here. Someone with tesla stock or cash wrote a call thinking no way tesla goes bananas before expiration. They were clearly wrong but assuming the call is covered they still profit the contract plus the strike and now someone else is holding the bags-- I mean shares
Same doesn‚Äôt make sense.. way OTM Tesla options that are available are NEVER that cheap
Low IV and good Greeks. During that time Tesla wasn‚Äôt volatile like it is now
That tesla call is absolutely retarded, props
Imagine believing this in the era of Tesla and meme stocks? Lmao
Need a fact check, fintel.io showing a 31% borrow fee rate for GME.  That seems extremely high and likely to drive up the cost of not closing a short position.  Apple and Tesla are under a half a percent.  Seems like a dam is about to break.
He‚Äôs probably secretly buying BB, just doesn‚Äôt want to recommend a WSB stock (guess except maybe for Tesla)
This might be the dumbest üåàüêª comment I've ever seen.Before you try to rebut. Using your logic, each individual Tesla store has a market cap of ~$6B.Or maybe publicly traded companies have more assets and intangibles than just their physical stores.Fucks sake man. I know this sub prides itself on being retarded, but you took it too far.
The exact same thing happened with Tesla every single time it‚Äôs run up. It‚Äôs just an endless barrage of hit pieces. Now every time I see a hit piece I just know some mother fucking tendies are about to be served.
Palantir at 25 is like Tesla at 50 for years. Hold and diamond hands
Yo can we get some people to tweet at Elon and get him to see the value on GME?  We‚Äôve helped push Tesla and generate value, maybe it‚Äôs time for him to return the favor and buy up 9.9% of GME.If you‚Äôre reading this and with the SEC, I‚Äôm kidding.
Damn I finally met a retard in the wild in the small town I live in. Saw a kid getting out of a Tesla while I was picking up a pizza, complemented him on it and told him I‚Äôd get on his level if I just keep throwing money at Tesla, he said ‚Äústonks only go up‚Äù lol
Musk founded X, which merged with PayPalMusk didn't found tesla either
I miss when Tesla was pumping $30 plus a day
I‚Äôm writing them a letter thanking them for paying off my Tesla for me.
My entire account rests upon Tesla giving us that big dick energy next week.
Lol at you blurring out a very obvious tesla purchase
If you‚Äôre looking for a play Tesla and GameStop are super undervalued right now
Bet this dumbass still doesn't have Tesla.
Remember what happened with Tesla EOD quadruple witching? They bought a shitton, price ended at 695, huge spike. Hold on GME. shit will likely go wild EOD, then more Tuesday, moon landing on Wednesday.
Damn that Tesla call. I have the same ones. Big sad üòû
I had people like you tell me this as I bought tesla worth 200$ 2 years ago
Same here. Entry was 27$. The problem is everytime i get money, i just pour everything in tesla. At the beginning i was a person who was careful about investing, now i‚Äòm just a person who puts all in his money in one stock thx to wsb. You convinced me. Sadly, Tesla lost his yolo status. Therefore, PLTR to the moon!üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Only you retards could convince me to make GME my 2nd largest position behind tesla
Tesla gets a price upgrade to 1000 TSLA stock: üò¥
Same. First day at WSB and I just sold Tesla shares for 50 GME sharesüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
I've got 100k of margin available. For every 100 upvotes this gets, I'll buy 100 more shares in it. It's all going against my Tesla shares so it's gonna be one YOLO or the other that rides me to Valhalla, shiny and chrome.
Sold Tesla to buy more GME. This dip is too juicy. Sorry papa I‚Äôll be back
Lol imagine hating on a stock that just made a ton of people rich. Stop being salty and enjoy the ride while it‚Äôs going on. You‚Äôre the same people who tried to short Tesla for an entire year while others became millionaires
So I pull out of Tesla &amp put it all into GME??
Yeah fuck that. I‚Äôm never going to short Tesla just so I can watch my account get decimated.
Alright boys. I only have $800 after losing my ass on Tesla and other options by about $1800. What‚Äôs the move here to make gains and support the cause
What do we think GME can realistically climb to? This climb is on the same level of Tesla and both are freakin nuts
Tesla is 4225 dollars split adjusted
I remember as they shitalked tesla in 2019"Tesla is only having red numbers" -The Motley Fool"I dont see tesla higher than 700$" -WSJOut of spite I didn't listen to them, I sunk all my money into Tesla because I believed in them. This was before the Cybertruck announcement and everything elseLook where Tesla is now, 2400$ (split adjusted ofc)Just desperate resistance of people that refused to go with the times. We are the Market now.
Everyone is talking about Cohen but burry is going to have been right about 2008, GameStop, and probably Tesla here soon.
What do Elon Musk and Thomas Edison have in common?They both got rich off of Tesla.
They tried to pull a similar trick on SolarCity . Bond holders wanted the company to go bankrupt and common shareholders be wiped out. Since bond holders are first in line to get their money in a liquidation, they were conspiring to fail the company by making its shares worthless. Elon Musk had to merge it into Tesla to save it from this attack.
Tesla going break 900 today easily
With that logic he owns part of Tesla too.
I am also liquidating my Tesla position tomorrow and going in GME. Planning on 20k-50k in calls at open, riding that for some profit till midday ü§ûthen shares to hold for next week.Unsure if I dump into shares or do 50% Friday and 50% Tuesday if my play works out.
Good choice. Will be the next tesla, but not only used in one car. 100$ eoy, 300$ 2022 üöÄüöÄüöÄ
$BBAi backed cybersecurity, already many NSA certifications, APPLE CAR WILL USE BB QNX, AWS X IVY will be in 175m + vehicles with recurring payments, QNX + IVY can be used in ALL EV, ALSO in medtech and aerospace plus protection in 5g infrastructure, Verizon's Skyward drones partner with UPS to deliver packages, guess what? verizon is protected by Blackberry CylanceThat's not enough for you?Tesla is a target customer for IVY and QNX
Why not just go all in on stocks like Tesla, Zoom, and Wayfair? These all performed better than the ARK funds last year. I wouldn‚Äôt follow this advice myself, since I don‚Äôt decide what to buy based on past returns. But if that is the metric you use, these stocks would seem better than the ARK funds.
Can't sleep. Too excited for the epic Tesla really tomorrow.
Honestly? As long as RC is running GME I‚Äôm gonna be heavily invested in this.He is e-commerce‚Äôs Elon musk and I‚Äôm not missing out on Tesla 2.0.This stock will change my life.
I bought a fuckton of late feb calls and some March and July and even November.I‚Äôm legit in this fucking thing long term...this is Tesla 2.0 and I‚Äôm not fucking missing out again
Literally the sky is the fucking limit right now. Think Tesla 2020......

I work for a major solar company and Tesla entering the inverter market is huge. Another thing people are looking over is LG is now building panels with their own integrated inverters. Enphase is definitely in trouble and over valued, but like you said, I have no idea when to time this market with solar being so hot.
So buy more Tesla? üßê
Why wouldn't ICLN also buy into TSLA for the solar inverters or w/e? Hard to imagine Tesla gets 100% of the market.

Tesla mooning now lol. PT raised.
Tesla got upgraded again lol. Here we go boys.
Tesla 900 tomorrow
I mean, just look at Tesla. Stocks are valued on memes now, not actual fundamentals.
BB to 50 and Tesla to 1000! üá∫üá∏
for real. I'd make the argument this is the best WSB play of all time, for the following reasons:1) Everyone doubted him hardcore the entire time, and he calmly shrugged off the doubt and held anyway2) Despite being up 10x on his investment (read: calculated gamble), he held all the way until now for a 70x on a 6 figure inflow. 3) He was at one point down 50%, and continued to hold, even through the covid crash where everyone else was bankrupting themselves on spy puts4) When he finally began to pull out he didnt even completely exit. He BOUGHT SHARES to help the short squeeze and everyone on wallstreetbets. And made out even more from it.5) A large part of his calls expired the WEEK before an explosive run fueled by Jim Cramer tweeting, with them being 13% OTM last week and now the strike price of which is currently half the share price. Madness.&amp#x200BDFV, you inspire us all. The lesson here is do some god damn research, stick with your conviction and buy leaps, not 0dte tesla fds.
I hear people say the market is completely unhinged, I'm not sure I buy that.Sure, there is Tesla and the EV market. And then there is GME.But those are a loud minority. GME isn't even really unexplainable. The short sellers overdid it and now they are screwed. The rest of the market, particularly the tech side, is backed up by great earnings.
Biden just announced a tesla and GameStop merge so all games can be played in the vehicle üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
&gt	What happens then? Do people still buy stocks as they go down or do you go cashLike with any crash, there is fear thereafter.  Dot com happened and the accounting scandals begun.. Enron, world-com, tyco.. Wall Street darlings.  Amazon and other darling ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù companies were -95% and going bankrupt everyday.You think Tesla is hot today? Have a look at Amazon from 99 to 01.. it later bottomed at $5.xx after having gone up $5 to $100 in under a year from 98-99.https://i.imgur.com/QZcU2OI.jpgAmazons historical chart is especially nice because the stock has never split. The prices you see are what they were back then.‚Äî-Once average Joe got accustomed to the reality that stocks are ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt live in your worthless share certificates‚Äù... on came the next great investment to make that you that big money you saw just a few years ago... *real estate.*So no.. not too many people were talking about stocks until 06-07 and that‚Äôs when the cracks in real estate were coming through.  We know the rest of the story.On a side note.. Dot com started showing cracks when the fed raised the rates in quick succession spooking the market. It went higher but there was fear.  The accounting scandals, 9/11, war in Afghanistan, then Iraq, hurricane katrina etc all happened back to back to back. No exactly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù from an average Joe‚Äôs point of view.Anyway..  people are *always* looking to make fast money. It happens again and again.. junk bonds in the late 80s  early 90s, ‚Äúinternet‚Äù stocks in 97-00, real estate and housing derivatives 05-08.  You can see the same patterns play out today in crypto markets, EV and SPAC‚Äôs.  No one asks questions on how this technology can actually be used to *make money*.  It‚Äôs completely secondary to ‚Äúbuy now and sell higher‚Äù ... you know ... *greater fools theory* in action./ramble
This guy is throwing out too many numbers. JUst talk about clean energy and Tesla
Going to use my Blackberry to call up the local Game Stop to order the newest Tesla game.
Buyden is going to read his speech about ICLN, TESLA and PLUG off of his BlackBerry he just got from GameStop tonight
GME: I am the Tesla now
The year is 2045. Cathie cured death and Elon transcended time itself. The Gamestop Galaxy has merged with the Tesla nebula. Schoolchildren learn about bears but studying fossilized remains of Plotkin.PLTR is on track to set ATH at 34.50
Innovation always wins. So you're saying more Tesla?
Friday Tesla 900c gonna print! What what!
The first most shorted stock was Tesla wasn‚Äôt it? WallStreetBets kicks ass. Fuck MM‚Äôs and Institutional investing. Our collective Autism and the wife‚Äôs boyfriends allowance is all we need!! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Surprised this isn't the highest upvoted comment. Probably the best very recent example of extreme irrational exuberance. Took almost 3 years for this bubble to pop, and valuations are still pretty high. Similarly to Tesla, no matter how you did the math, even when accounting for 100% market dominance, the valuations didn't make sense.
THANK YOU JIM CRAMER "Don't sell Tesla stock"
Tesla shorts lost billions of dollars. GME shorts are sweating they about to be the runner up of that record
If bidens speech brings Tesla to 875+ I will burn all my maga stuff and vote Democrat
Jack Ma doesn‚Äôt care because he‚Äôs gotta focus or lose a finger making those Tesla license plates.
Doesn‚Äôt matter, we own the fucking market. MMs have no fucking power. Don‚Äôt believe me ? Look at Tesla, look at GME. All we gotta do is pick the next meme stock and here we go :)
It‚Äôs really hard to buy 700,000 calls. When you start trying to buy in that qty the price of the call and the stock goes up. There is a little bit of wiggle room to make a big profit if the market makers are not pricing the options correctly, as happened with Tesla. Usually something like that happens when there is a big asymmetry in market sentiment. I mean, I guess it could be the shorts creating that situation, but it seems a little Wile E Coyote to me. No one shorts a stock so they can try to squeeze themselves..?
YEEAAAHHHH, PLTR needs to be the next TESLA, I don‚Äôt care how many I keep having to buy more of their stock at a loss. They have a product that blows my fuckin‚Äô mind!
Yooooo making Tesla look like a fucking poverty asset
The year is 2021 and BlackBerry and GameStop are keeping me afloat while Tesla struggles
Tesla in 5 years is my positional goal lmao. Shooting for model x but portfolio looking like a used model 3 so far lmao
Tesla makes $20B and has a $800B market capGME makes around $5B and has a $2B market capI believe bubbles should be fair for all sectors, all memesGME to $100 EOM
Just to be clear: GME's market cap is $2bill about now. If it were to match CHWY, share price would be about $920.Not enough? No stock has ever been shorted this high, and a infinity squeeze would rush the price over several thousand. Is that not enough? Well if GME had the same P/E ratio as Tesla, share price would be $15000.
Shrug, people were called retards for buying Tesla between $600-1500 pre splitDon't *bet* anything you can't afford to lose
I've been holding since $11. Was too scared to buy in at $2 thanks to all those people saying AMD was going bust (the same doomers that said Tesla was going to $0) - but I realised this company is the biggest growth stock in the market and couldn't sleep on it anymore. I'll keep holding until $200+
Criticizing us for buying Tesla?!? Bitch they bubbled on shitty mortgage securities TWICE. Fuck gay bear boomers fuck gay bear boomers fuck em to hell
GME is the better playHard to love your TSLA when the touchscreen looks like the world through a pair of $5 truck stop sunglasseshttps://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/feds-asks-tesla-to-recall-158000-vehicles-over-failing-touchscreen-displays/
Sold Tesla to buy more GME today üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
The fact that ARKK is still printing with Tesla being kinda flat is next level shit. Good shit Cathie
Tesla will lower model 3 price to 2000 so that everyone can get one with the stimulus check.
&gtthank you for your comment. We obviously know WSB and their love for the number 420,69 (clearly, WSB is close to infinitely more famous than we are). We always thought this number was patented by the Tesla stock. Is this information outdated? Overall, FS Associates and WSB seem to have slightly different approaches to investing. Nevertheless, we have respect for WSB and are aware of their huge impact on retail investing. lol.
YOU SOLD EARLY ON TESLAYOU SOLD EARLY ON NIODONT SELL EARLY ON GAMESTOP
ford also has a stake in rivian. an ev competitor to tesla
Great news! Tesla to 2000! Everyone of them will buy a Tesla with their stimilus check. Next check 2000000 usd for all citizens.
BUY GME SHARES. AND HOLD!  THIS IS LAST YEARS TESLA SQUEEZE ALL OVER AGAIN. ALL THE WALL STREET LOSERS ARE SHORT. WE ARE GOING TO HOLD AND DRIVE IT UP. THEY WILL HAVE TO COVER OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS/MONTHS!!! BUY AND HOLD!
What if GME is the new tsla and tsla comes out with a model 6 GME edition tesla with a built in ps5
BB will shake the 'BB is a phone company' skepticism like Tesla shook the 'TSLA is a Car Company' skepticism. Not comparing the two but BB has more to offer than the market is giving them credit for.... GME Part 2? It's obvious that BB is a company in transition, the market is trying to value them on their past, not their future. The negative connotation of BB's past has continually depressed the SP and limited the growth. Every other OEM/Vendor/Supplier/Partner in the EV Space has been riding hysteric headwinds to the moon when BB is further along in their development process (whether this is justified or not remains to be seen). I feel like their executive team Selling Patents to Hauwei not only frees up capital to spend in the areas that will have the highest yield, but it also seems like they are trying to distance themself from their former selves... Plus, who doesn't like a good comeback story? **Position - BB 012122 10 C**
GME has to go up because it quite literally has to go up. Sell all your duds right now and enjoy a +50% minimum rocket the next week. Thank me later. I‚Äôm talking your PLTR &amp your NIO sell all that shit. Then when you turn your $2000 account into $5-$6,000 yolo all in Tesla and enjoy the ride. Shit like this never comes around. GAMESTOP HAS TO GO UP BECAUSE SHORTS ARE ABOUT TO GET THEIR ASSHOLES GAPED.
tesla 940 today
Gay bears: ‚ÄúTESLA FUCKED LMAO RECALLS COST BAJILLIONS I LOVE BURRY‚ÄôS COCK‚ÄùTesla Premarket: down $6ü§°ü§°ü§°
Tesla. Is. Not. SpaceX.    They are *completely* different companies.    I swear I think half their market cap is because of people thinking they are buying part of SpaceX.
Not just that, people forget that buying Amazon back then would be like buying xpeng in hopes it will pass tesla, like are you stupid no you wouldn't do it just like you wouldn't buy Amazon back in 2000, people literally do not think sometimes
Exactly so annoying, every metric points to a bubble p/e, p/s, shiller p/e, also a big misconception of the dot com was that if you had held you would have made money, that was only true if you had bought Amazon or Apple but if you bought any company with a market cap over 100 billion then you would have lost money like yahoo, cisco, Linux, Intel, but let me tell you a little secret, buying Amazon or Apple back then would be like buying xpeng in hopes it would surpass tesla, of course you wouldn't do it just like you wouldn't buy Amazon or Apple to beat eBay or Nokia back in 2000
I'm so tempted to sell this tesla call earlier and fomo into gme shares and calls
Sell my tesla call and get in on GME?
It shouldn't be but go look at the tesla subreddit or any stock subreddit. The TSLA fanbois are fucking insane and have no concept of P/E. They fully expect Musk to take over control of the world's energy generation, AI, EV market, public transport, space travel etc.
Exactly I keep seeing these tesla millionaires who just started investing and have never been through a real bubble pop, also I remember I found an article dated to 1999 when a guy said that there was no way the bubble could pop because to many people wanted to buy and hold because tech was the future, and look how that turned out
Tesla fan boys (myself included) buy some GME just this time. We'll help you out later. Pinky promise.
It's modest but to me it's alot. Started at 10k and now I'm at 110k. NIO played a big part in that. I posted here that I missed Tesla at 200 bucks last year and wanted to know the next Tesla and someone said NIO. I did my research and bam here we are.
Was it too late to buy Tesla at 400 pre split?
Investing in Tesla is not investing in SpaceX.Get over it.
&gt	Tesla holders are stubborn afUntil they see a -25% day and see their $1M profit become $750k in one day. Then another -20% the next day. Uh-oh just lost half the profit you earned over a year in 48 hours. I take it you haven‚Äôt seen bubbles pop before? It takes a long time to climb up a mountain, but it‚Äôs a very short trip falling off of a cliff.
Tesla is so big now if it crashes it can cause the next market crash. The margin calls and selling of index funds would be self-reinforcing.The flash crash was some dude trying to spoof orders for index futures. Imagine what Tesla dropping 20% a day would do.
Burry is discounting that Musk is taking the human race to another *planet* in a hurry, making brain surgery robots that connect computers to people‚Äôs brains, and bringing 4k pornhub and facebook to every last millimeter of the planet.People don‚Äôt invest in Tesla like they invest in GM because they‚Äôre not investing in just a company, they‚Äôre investing in Musk. I wouldn‚Äôt short Musk until he steps on Mars (I suspect the mortality rate of Martian visitors is highish.).
Why is that a picture of a Tesla? And WTF how did BABA 'develop' a whole new car all of a sudden? Sounds like Tesla's Chinese factory has already been pillaged for IP.
Someone asked for Elon‚Äôs tweet to be deciphered and then deleted there comment while I went to work. So here goes.The tweet:‚ÄúLarge crumple zones, rigid body structure &amp low center of gravity really make a difference‚ÄùLetter 20: GLetter 61: MLETTER 75: E20 * 61 - 75 = 1145.The Tesla model Y was used in this test. Y is the 25th number in the alphabet.With this information I can conclude that TSLA will reach 1145 by January 25th.
Tesla stock price too low imo
Slow like tesla. You folks are spoiled üòÖ
When I suddenly get the urge to get in on Tesla, that is when the bubble will pop. Will keep you retards updated if I ever get to that point.
Burry vs. Cathy Wood, battle of the titans.Cathy Wood said Tesla would hit $4,000 and here we are.PS never bet against musk
&gt I think the second option is Tesla hits 1000 and crashes shortly after after many long term investors sell out at some dip (5-10 percent) which triggers a major selloff from everyone else.I was holding Tesla when it dipped from $300 to $180 and Elon was fucking with the SEC and calling some Thai expat (who had just saved a bunch of kids) a pedo.  Tesla also had like a looming debt payment.If that wasn't enough for people to kill Tesla and pressure people to sell, I don't know what will.
I hate how I never joined a gang. Tesla gang, planter gang, or GME gang. I‚Äôm just a gay bear
Plot twist: It's Michael Burry, but the actual one not the Christian Bale version. And he just sits in the back of your Tesla and won't shut up about how overvalued they are as a company, completely overlooking everything else while you eat your tendies on full self driving at 120 on the PCH
Tesla
Lmao dude zero chance. Everyone holding Tesla sees 2 factories coming online, 2 currently online, Fsd take rate is high af, and this year you‚Äôll see the first battery factories start to go up. This stock will be 1T by EOY. There is no bubble when Tesla can consistently hit the targets it set for itself. Everyone said 500k in 2020 was impossible, guess whose eating surf and turf now
*Tesla recalls 158,000 vehicles* Pump it wallstreetbets
no wonder Tesla is overweight
Tesla and the entire EV sector are maniacally overvalued. It‚Äôs definitely a bubble, problem is no one knows when it‚Äôll pop.
SRAC, SPCE, NPA, likley Tesla, likley Boeing, possible several battery and avianoics companies.
Fuck dude. I was looking for something to buy before market closed and I settled for Tesla like an idiot.
Can‚Äôt sleep. Too excited to see my tesla calls red tomororw
Remember when Elon said Tesla shares were overvalued so it mooned for several months afterwards?
&gt2. Yes he clearly has a niche for this but nobody knows when the fuck the bubble will pop for Tesla there are no indicators.I know when it will pop. When other auto manufactureres are competitive with Tesla in the EV market. And it's starting to happen, but we're not at the tipping point yet.Think it all depends on whether Tesla can push out a good, affordable EV hatchback in the near future - would do well in Europe and Asia markets. Bubble will be prolonged. As long as Tesla shows they can hold technological + growth dominance, the irrational vaulation will continue. That and you will struggle to find cheap contracts. Essentially short is risky and still has a reasonable chance of blowing up in your face.
This is going to squeeze more like Tesla vs VW. But the principle is the same.
Invest that $7 in Tesla and in two weeks you‚Äôll have $10. 30% is 30%
I said this on my other account but will say again, game stop is the first stock I sold that I didn‚Äôt want to see drop and was legit happy for everyone.  The game stop pumpers aren‚Äôt obnoxious and rabid like recent Tesla and palantir pumpers, who would be hostile and just basically douche bags.
Yes, first of all today's action was not a squeeze. this wasn't shorts covering.  That hasn't even started yet.  This was probably a few things. The market reacting to Ryan Cohen being on the board and bringing his chewy magic to gamestop.   Also Jim Cramer and other news outlets have started covering the stock. I fully expect a boomer wave to buy in tomorrow. I also expect people to panic sell some tesla when they hear about the touch screen recall. A portion of those will plug that money into GME.  A massive wall of short positions expire friday and they got margin called once the stock hit 24 (so I've read). They have pressure to get out or roll up in the next two days.  All of this to say I expect it to go up.
what if tesla started selling cars
He may be early on shorting Tesla but he‚Äôs not wrong. Too bad that‚Äôs the same thing.
Tesla hitting ATH after that recall is such a bro move
I was literally about to post about this! Does how many people think that tesla will just explode in the next week and half
Tesla recall shows they really care about their customers. +5% at open.
Whose holding Tesla calls and not letting the bad news bring you down üíéü§öü§°
Well, I‚Äôm retarded and officially done trying to YOLO. I‚Äôve tried countless plays over the past year and every one has led to losing everything I have put into the market. All of them are my fault. I mean I paper-handed Tesla calls during the greatest bull run ever seen. I have been gaped by Theta gang, had many options expire worthless, and have seen my gains melt away because I diamond handed too long. I‚Äôm afraid that I will go completely broke if I continue to be in the markets.  Now I‚Äôm so depressed and poor with no income because I‚Äôm a graduate student. I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy, just venting. I‚Äôm genuinely happy for all of you who can do this and have something to show for it. One day I‚Äôll be back. Until then, respectively, fuck you.
Futures up a million percent and I‚Äôm still sweating my Tesla calls.. Man I‚Äôm a bitch.
At least you know how to cut a loser. And I dont mean Tesla. Hahaha
Anyone know Burry's cost basis on his GME shares? I think he bought pretty much at the bottom of 2019, if I remember right, so that would be 3.30. He has 1,700,000 shares. so if we take 31.30-3.10=28 then 28 x 1.7 mil we can see that Burry made 47,600,000 off of just GME! I wonder if that covers his unrealized Tesla Losses... lol
BREAKING NEWS: Tesla stock soars on 150k vehicle recall as retail investors frenzy to buy into the stock after its 1.2% dip.
Tesla I better wake up to 900 tomorrow
This is good news, because with all new displays Tesla can offer more software features  and increase revenue with apps and subscriptions.
When I see those Tesla autists get massive gains I just upvote and move on, if only they would return the favor
Am I actually a billionaire why isn‚Äôt Tesla at 100k if futures are up 1 billion? ??
Okay this tesla dip isn‚Äôt terrible, wondering how welll open tomorrow
Biden gonna say ‚ÄúElon is my favorite CEO out of all EV companies and so we‚Äôre pumping 3 trillion directly into Tesla‚Äù

Tesla news is on older models. We good, Buy the dip.
The actual business of Tesla is irrelevant at this stage. It is just a meme. And its on a mission to hit 1000
tesla pleas drive again
chist, i though when i checked tesla it would be in the 600s based on this thread-- down 0.6% lol
The fact that Tesla ain‚Äôt taking hard means we üêÇ üêÇ
Tesla recalls 31% of there 2020 car sales üòÇ knowing TSLA it‚Äôll pump higher
Good thing Tesla isn‚Äôt a car company anymore.
Poor attempt at a pump smh. Stock is already up  200% last three months and Tesla doesn‚Äôt even use lidar. I‚Äôll pass. ‚ÄòTechnicals pointing in every direction‚Äô lmao and what might these be?
Tesla gonna gap up to 1000 when we rotate our tendies out of GME
I'm with gorilla though. I think the great majority of people would be calling themselves quite rich on 160k a year. Especially with no mortgage or rent,. You can call it not-fatfire if you want but man. If I can travel a few times a year and eat and shop without having to look at my bank account that's all I want in life and from retirement.Don't forget no car payments because you'll have a lambo already. Well, probably a Tesla Model S Plaid for me.
Somebody tell Bell delphi or whatever that e-hoe name is to tweet about Tesla, I need it to hit $1000 by Friday üôè
After what happends to Tesla and GME!! Im never doubting WSB again. All in Palantir
I‚Äôm just holding. I got in early enough though where I‚Äôm still up decently. MT and VALE.The play has always been a long hold with June expiry on MT. Vito mentioned maybe even a longer expiry now. Praying that news comes out with car manufacturers and the above mentioned companies.If Tesla partners with Vale, I could turn my portfolio into a dividend account. üöÄ
Can Tesla moon after hours pls it‚Äôs been a long day
People called him an idiot in 2005 and 2006 for shorting the housing market as it was going up. People are calling him an idiot now for betting against Tesla. Will be interesting to see if history repeats itself.
As Ganymede Kyle Melvin III licks the Vulcan jizz from his curled lips, he undocked his EVO helmet from the crotch port of said Vulcan. The most logical being to ever frequent a Space X Wendy‚Äôs hops into his Tesla Space X Model Starfuck 17q and speeds off. All GK Melvin III can make out is the number plate on the back: GMEGANG4EVA
Is this guy looney or what, nah jk, but he is probably trying to pump his holdings, because no sane person could think tesla will reach a 2 trillion valuation in 2 years, I mean it took apple 2 decades to become a 2 trillion dollar company, but tesla a company who made less than 1 billion this year will get there in 2 years.
@milehighstockguy posted this on stocktwits: SI is 73.63M (though he concedes he is not sure how delayed that might be so it could be off by a little). Which means the SI actually INCREASED today. Fucking bananas. Not even close to capitulating.

I mean he literally had the shares, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs ‚Äúshoulda bought Tesla in June 2019‚Äù. He bought them, he just tried doing too much and overthinking it

Naw like deepfuckingvalue is just an omega Chad. I mean if he did it for tesla he'd be a trillionaire but dudes got balls and conviction. I personally think gamestop is still a joke but I still bought 100 shares and some calls (which I trimmed down on last week unfortunately), and I wont mind if I'm pleasantly proven wrong.
If u doubt tesla then your a boomer. Stonk only goes up
Just bought two lotto tickets *TSLA 1/15 $925c**TSLA 1/15 $940c*Just need Elon to announce that the new Tesla models grant you immortality.
Just bought some floor mats from that site. Weird company. They do news and sell some Tesla shit.
GME PROFITS INTO TESLA $900. DO YOU LIKE MONEY?
Yeah I locked in like 60% gains (on most of my portfolio) and held the last 1/4 of my shares in case it pulls a tesla. Was in at 17$
Would explain why it makes no sense now and Tesla only goes up
Tesla gang is rich. Game gang is rich. PLTR gang is eating ramen and wearing rags tonight showering with cold water.
I missed Tesla, now gme. I should get a yeeyee ass haircut as punishment
I see the difference as r/stocks and r/investing think they know how to make money. ‚ÄúBuy index funds‚Äù ‚Äúdollar cost averaging‚Äù, and other weak shit. Here we know that that‚Äôs a boring way to invest. So instead we go about finding stocks that will either rocket or crash and burn. GME is truly the blockbuster of the gaming industry. But it also has potential to change. Either crash into bankruptcy, or fly to fucking Mars. Nio, either rockets as the Tesla of China, or crashes and burns into the corruption of the CCP. We don‚Äôt make sound investments. We gamble.
I didn't buy any calls because I'm trying to be responsible and pay my mortgage first.... Fuck that I'm going to take a HELOC and YOLO Tesla puts.

Elon legit from Africa he can‚Äôt be a racist, buy Tesla
TESLA TOO THE FUCKING MOON

#GO TESLA FUCK THE BEARS
Don‚Äôt be scared to fuckin moon for me Tesla
Except that Tesla sales in Norway are declining. Audi is eating their lunch.
Intel has been more stagnant which is why they're not moving much right now. AMD is blown up because of innovation and capture of market share exponentially rising so there's a lot of future profits priced in. The P/E ratio is nothing compared to Tesla, though...
Everyone join me in a prayer circle that Tesla only goes uppies today.
Plugs absolute retard strength comparable only with Tesla
I remember when tesla was downgraded with a PT $10 before the split. Man, those were the days.
I asked my Girlfriend why she thought Tesla was a good play when people were talking shit and she said she follows high class strippers on Instagram and all those bitches drive Teslas

Just late night thoughts... I don‚Äôt post much on Reddit but I was thinking VALE is probably going to the moon.My thought process behind it is Apple is working on a EV. Tesla is dominating the market with EV. Nickel will be in super high demand but the main point is VALE strive on being an eco friendly mining company. Which Apple and Tesla both push for being eco friendly in their companies. If Apple works with another manufacturer they are going to make sure that they play by apples rules. Apple rules mean eco friendly no matter what. Just like removing all charging bricks from phones watch‚Äôs and even there wireless chargers. So to summarize Apple and Tesla will both need nickel for there cars and VALE is a cleaner mining company. VALE to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄMy English is horrible sorry for any grammatical, misspellings, or punctuation errors.
Just want to say you‚Äôre welcome to all the Tesla bulls because I know damn well if I bought at any point my luck would have single handedly derailed the tendie train
Holy shit Tesla up 10$ AH
Canoo is very exciting to me, because they are actually trying to rethink the form factor of a car in a way that Tesla isn‚Äôt. (Cybertruck aside) check out canoo‚Äôs video on the mpdv‚Äîit is a hybrid cargo truck, ready to go food truck, hipster van life etc etc. fucking smart. I sold too early, gonna take a bigger position once the tumor dies down a bit.
Could we just fucking pin the business insider url to the top of every daily discussion at 2am always some fucking idiots asking HOW DO YOU KNOW TESLA IS UP RIGHT NOW MARKETS ARE CLOSED
You are flat out wrong. I do this stuff for a living.Tesla may be able to get some deductible expenses and write offs out of reinvesting income, but if Musk sold his shares, he cant write any of that off against his personal tax liability. Musk and his companies are distinct entities for tax purposes. He would have to pay 13+ percent of his gain on his stocks to the Cali government if he sold while he was in Cali. He has to pay ugatz in state taxes in Texas if he sells now.Stuff you see on the news about billionaires not paying taxes is mostly bullshit. If they are actually making money, they are paying taxes.
One that's shrunk significantly since Tesla bailed it out.
Remember reading a thing today, his plan is legit sell everything to finance a mars city some day, even 1% difference in taxes can be huge at his net worth level. Like some potentially some countries gdp if Tesla keeps going at this pace.
The texas move is baffling. The only thing that makes sense is  the tax rate. But he's the richest dude on the planet, I doubt he cares about a couple billion more in taxes....If he thinks it's going to be easier to get things done in Texas he is in for a rude awakening.... I don't even think they allow Tesla showrooms there only classic dealerships, and if you ain't part of the oldboy network good luck. If it's anything like Florida it's going to be corrupt as shit.
Yes majority of Indians can't afford basic sanitation but they'll buy a Tesla. üöÄ
From the way people talk about Tesla you'd think other companies just ceased to exist
Ah yes, the daily dose of ‚Äúif you went back in time and invested in Tesla xD‚Äù. Go back to being the headline of clickbait business insider articles lol
how about those weekly "tesla is fuk" news articles from every fucking publisher under the sun since 2013
Market will be up big tmrw brahs. Buy Tesla !
"The value of this business (Tesla) is about deregulating energy. That's about batteries and battery storage, and it's about disrupting utilities‚Äù-Chamath Palihapitiya

Praying I wake up to tesla green tendies tomorrow, goin to fart in my eyes for good luck
My retired mom bought TSLA shares in the March dip because she heard about it from her boomer friends. Obviously she's up a lot, so she started getting interest in TSLA and decided to sell her paid-off car and buy a Tesla car. Cool, it's her money and she's buying a cool car. The problem is, she called me this morning and told me she ordered a Model S and because she's not using a gas car anymore, she ordered the Tesla solar roof thing, the battery pack, and the Tesla wall charger. She basically dropped $100k on Tesla products because she's up a bit on the stocks. Not only that, when I went to her house to talk to her after the call, I found a poster of Elon Musk hung up next to my dead dad's ashes. Is Tesla a cult?
Tesla is a part of S&ampP. Don‚Äôt be surprised.
Tesla price tmrw at open boys? 900$?
I bet he probably did throw it in Tesla and made a ton of money, but then decided a video would be consequential to his audience and just went on using that money for his other vids. No matter what happened, who cares? That was 6 months ago. Also, what was all the long term chair stuff about?
I need to make like $20k so I can start trading Tesla again.
Okay, hear me out guys. Apple‚Äôs big news is this: all stores are for vaccines, and if you get one, you get a discount on the new Hyundai/canoo vehicle, but they will keep tabs on you with palantir, and will partner with Tesla for their batteries. All this while going green by using PLUG to power all their stores. That covers all the meme stocks, right?
I picked up some Ford stock thinking it would go up when they hit the "emerging market" selling electric trucks to rednecks who hate Tesla. Only buy American made electric    lmao

##I am in no, way, shape, or form offering any investment advice nor am I endorsing Lemonade.  I do not own any shares of this company and I have not engaged Lemonade as a client.        OP, I know you said you work in VC, but I think you're missing something fairly basic.  Some stocks trade based on forward revenue.   Some stocks trade based on forward earnings per share.  Others, on EBITDA.        Tech companies, or more broadly any growth company, will often trade based on other intangible items.  For example, a biotech stock may trade up when it is reported that one of their leading candidates clears phase 2 clinical trials.        In the case of Lemonade, there are very few **scaled** assets currently in the market offering the kind of platform like it.  They're not being priced like a traditional insurance company and you're substantially discounting their scarcity value, as well as just how difficult it is to build a new scaled technology platform.  You can check this for yourself - just pull any random sample of broker / equity research reports and read what the analysts covering the company are saying.  Their peer group consists of companies like Snap, DoorDash, Twitter, Uber, Facebook, etc.  Furthermore, the KPIs that the company establishes itself (and signals to investors that these are important) are doing well, year over year.  User growth is almost doubled, premium per user is almost doubled, etc.  The market is perfectly happy with continuing to invest in the Company despite the losses.        I personally think all of the TSLA short sellers got blown up by this same way of thinking "oh my god fundamentally Tesla is ridiculous!  there's no way it's worth 420x earnings!" not realizing that this isn't how the market has decided to determine Tesla's price.

Cheer up buddy, they only have paper gains........ just kidding, I am sitting on a stash of $1mil of Tesla from my original $100k investment last year.
When the Tesla bubble bursts itll take the entire market down with it
I got into Lemonade before Motley Fool recommended it. Some guy named "Dave Lee On Investing" did a video series on it and I've watched it at least a couple of times.He was a super early investor in Tesla (since 2013). Caught companies like Square and  Peleton, before they were even on Reddit's radar. And provides unique insights on companies like Unity, OpenDoor, Robox that a lot of people wouldn't even consider.He literally goes through the entire company's S1 filing, all their shareholder letters, and then watches every single interview or presentation by the CEO / management team of a company. He even managed to get an interview with the CEO of Lemonade on his channel.Of all his DD videos, he believes SQ, TSLA and LMND are the most obvious 10X investments. I trust his track record so far and got into Lemonade at around $60.&amp#x200BThe current insane rise, is probably due to Motley Fool and quite a few of the popular YouTube investing channels also promoting LMND.

Your problem is thinking all stocks are being bought with ‚Äòrational metrics‚Äô. Just look at Tesla or any other growth stock right now. PE‚Äôs at unreasonable values and still growing. You may need to change your metrics on potential growth stocks and see the opportunity that others are buying in for.
Don't even talk to me about bubbles on reddit. Tesla has a 1,624.17 PE ratio and is pumped to sh\*\*t. I mean good on the bag holders, but I don't want to hear anyone on reddit say the word 'bubble' lol
Tesla needs to open tomorrow at 865 or more that would make me very happy.&amp#x200BAnyone else

I used google translate:Arcelormittal tries to get an order from Tesla in Gr√ºnheide The steel producer Arcelormittal is trying to supply sheet steel to the new Tesla plant in Gr√ºnheide for its location in Eisenh√ºttenstadt.  "We are of good cheer that we can sell quantities", quoted the "M√§rkische Oderzeitung" on Monday one of the managing directors, Ralf-Peter B√∂sler. The company is currently in an approval process with other competitors from the US electric car manufacturer Tesla, which is currently building a production facility for electric cars in Brandenburg.  "It is the standard practice of auto manufacturers," said a company spokesman.  Details, such as the planned delivery quantities and the price, were initially not known.  Arcelormittal employs 2500 people at its Eisenh√ºttenstadt site.

Why are you struggling? Just buy fucking Tesla.It's an actual infinite money hack.
Yeah you probably paid too much for a call that close to the money and this close to expiration. But, Tesla will go up $50 tomorrow and you will be fine
exactly this. Tesla as a company hasn't changed much in the last year yet their stock jumped like there is no tomorrow. No justification for this

TSLA is literally infinite money. When you buy TSLA, you can then buy a Tesla with the tendies, which boosts the stock price up even further. Change my mind.

Problem with Tesla's is they still arent luxurious enough to justify the price. They have the tech, but not the build and material quality especially in the interior. I think a lot of people looking for an ev would love a second option on the same level as tesla without such a god awful interior. (Most people arent paying 30k for their tesla)
Tesla has now the cheat code for infinite money. It's worth a lot, can release a micro% of its equity to boost growth even further which in turn makes it grow even more.Yes there will be corrections down the line, but we're simply experiencing the "5 years ahead of everyone else" moment that made the iPhone so successful. The only way is UP üöÄ
It‚Äôs all relative. You could argue Tesla and the market at large are grossly overvalued, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing things down. It‚Äôs all a risk v reward play. Risk is you lose everything. Reward is tendie town. Play accordingly.

I have a strong feeling the Indian market will bleed money. They literally pile on trains for transportation and ride scooters everywhere, why would they be able to afford a Tesla?
Yet it's odd that few consider it, given how branding is one of the most important things in a product.Li Auto: Boring name. Literally the founder name + AutoXPeng: how do you pronounce it? Ex-peng? Sh-peng? Too long, too many syllables. I can't sketch the logo.NIO: the chosen one from the matrix, easy to draw logo and easy to remember. Also very similar to Palantir logo. Also, first mover's advantage as "Chinese Tesla", of that gains enough traction is enough alone to push sales, considering how the "Chinese" adjective that used to be associated to "low quality manufacturing" is now becoming "value for money technology" (think of all the Chinese smartphones that are storming the market like Xiaomi, OnePlus, Huawei, etc.. and are held in high regard)All the others.. what others? :)

People who say Tesla is overvalued don't understand, it's not just a car company it's a lifestyle. After I bought my first Tesla, I got into a local club of owners and I can tell you, everyone thinks of it as a part of their life and not just a means of getting from A to B. Everyone is thinking of installing Tesla solar panels as well. You can't put a value on that, ain't no retards be selling this thing. Tesla to the moon and beyond!

The government likes wasting money. They'll sell weapons that were confiscated to contractors and then buy them back to arm our troops to confiscate weapons, oil, and other shit... Probably a bullshit example, but the moral of the story is that all the government likes to eat up their budget, even if they don't need it. With billions being poured into defense, analytics (COVID tracking), and distribution, PLTR is bound to benefit off of this. Besides, Palantir is also becoming more and more relevant in the ever-emerging market of data analytics for commercial use. Further, the entry to establish in their market is high so they have little equal competition for what they can do. Also, high evaluations are good for companies... Tesla, for example, has made a ton of money through offerings, which will be able to sustain research and other costs for years to come. As for Palantir, they have gone up %130 since their IPO... If that isn't a clear indication, I don't know what is.Also, I'm just fucking around. That said, they do have good room for growth and they can benefit a lot with commercial contracts besides govt contracts.
No he's not, this guy sounds like a retarded 12 year old.Tesla opened several % higher when Elon took world's richest man, so it didn't fluctuate at all.

I‚Äôve been through three cr√ø-pto bubbles (including the current one), and Twitter/Reddit/Facebook always goes nuts. People creating accounts with their favorite cr√ø-pto project logos as the profile pics, just to spam comments like ‚Äúbuy the dip,‚Äù and ‚Äúhold and buy more,‚Äù ‚Äúthey are building partnerships with so many major companies,‚Äù and parroting the same bullet points about each cr√ø-pto project. It happens every halving cycle.But NEVER before have I seen a publicly traded stock suddenly have the exact same social media presence as those cr√ø-pto projects... until now. Every thread about Tesla is filled with ‚Äú$1000 coming this week,‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs still undervalued,‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs more than a car company, holding for grandkids,‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt miss out, still room to triple the price this year.‚Äù These are not just r/WallStreetBets comments and posts‚Äîthey are on every social media platform right now. It‚Äôs a mania just like cr√ø-pto becomes every cycle. TSLA is at the point where retail investors are running out of disposable income and are just holding whatever positions they entered with, no one is buying shares at this insane price level. Institutions and large holders are going to take a shit on those holders. Some will panic sell and others will keep watching their holdings lose value until they just sell out of desperation or hold on forever hoping for a bounce that may not come for years.For every Cathie and Chamath, there is a Burry and Joshua. It‚Äôs going to collapse like nothing we‚Äôve seen in the traditional stock market in a long while.

Tesla fucked up a whole bunch of vibes around here today. I want the vibes back.
They still have to cover 100something percent of float. This removes the guaranteed force squeeze in June. More than likely we see a tesla style squeeze now.
At that point you are considered a sophisticated investor and get to do fun, sexy stuff with pre-IPO securities. Imagine getting to buy a chunk of tesla before they were publicly traded.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sophisticatedinvestor.asp#:~:text=A%20sophisticated%20investor%20is%20a,advanced%20types%20of%20investment%20opportunities.

Isn't it strange people went from $30k to $200k in Tesla. If you asked them to invest $200k into Tesla they would say "that's nuts, no way" but every second they do not withdraw their $200k in, they are essentially making the decision every second to deposit that $200k into Tesla.
Tesla goes up 274926482% *ok*Goes down 7% **tHe bUBbL poPPed**
If Tesla stagnates or ends lower by friday, the amount of 1/15 loss porn will be glorious
I‚Äôm not even in Tesla but I hope it moons tomorrow just because I love the energy in here
L U C I D   TESLA KILLER
My prediction for Tesla says if we are green, it won't be a face ripper, maybe +2% or +3%, but if we're red, it will at least be as red as today, if not more. Other predictions? (üöÄüöÄüöÄ is an exeptable answer)
Tesla to 2k when they reveal bltcoin holdings
Tesla +10% tomorrow
NIO went up 15% last week, and 10% over the weekend. Tesla did the same run up. Guess what happened to TSLA today. What will happen to NIO tomorrow?
Tesla $900 tomorrow. You heard it here first!
So when dollar is worth less... throw more at tesla, got it.
I agree, I overheard my wife and her boyfriend laugh at me because i can‚Äôt pull the trigger on Tesla. One day I‚Äôll show them
Tesla pleas FLY
Tesla is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy
Just woke up from a coma, seems like Tesla has been trading flat for a whole year!
Wish Tesla made cellphones
Tesla is gonna moon tomorrow.
After hours is good for Tesla, cry about it
I swear if we have another red Tesla day tomorrow, we gonna have to open an emotional support group for all these broke ass nephews that thought FD‚Äôs were free $$$ ‚ò†Ô∏è

$CCIV will be the biggest deal of the year. The CEO was responsible for developing the Model S for Tesla. Need I say more?üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
The amount of people bullish on Tesla means it‚Äôll either go up or down tomorrow
There‚Äôs a digital currency (that shall not be named) that gained 130% in the last month, and just lost 35% in 2 days. It could never happen to Tesla though!
Fuck I‚Äôm tied up in Tesla calls on today‚Äôs dip... I will unload them hopefully on next positive day and load up onntbis
I‚Äôm seeing Tesla at 1040.00 by this week cuz that‚Äôs the only call I can afford
Bruh. Read this post from investing  ‚ÄúHi guys. Hoping for some advise here. My brother recently told me about Tesla and the stock market and showed me the crazy amount of money he‚Äôs made. On Friday, I put 25% of me and my SO‚Äôs net worth into Tesla. What happened? Why‚Äôd the stock lose so much value today, I thought it was supposed to go up?Should I sell? Really hope we see someGains soon, everyone is telling me it‚Äôs the next Amazon and going to $1000.  I‚Äôm really new to investing but robinhood makes it seem really easy so if anyone else has any tips on stocks that will double or triple this year let me know!!! Appreciate the advise :)‚ÄúThe top is in.
Good lord after 11 days of winning, one red day and so many people: "Tesla is doomed".  I'm just gonna buy more if it dips further. Been cost-averaging for 6 months already.
Come tomorrow at open I‚Äôm just going to be another faceless Tesla bear dead beside the road, only distinguishable from the guy beside me by the degree to which my asshole is exploded
I FOMO'd into shares at $900 pre split and then panic sold them all after a brief dip because I knew it was overvalued lolol üò≠Only a special kind of retard loses on Tesla last year
Yes it will be 1037 at approximately 1/28 10:36 amReason: Tesla goes up usually
TESLA AND APPLE ARE GOING TO GAP UP
I was up a couple hundred $$ this morning on steel calls but it was boring so I bought Tesla intraday and ended the day -$1k
Damn Cathie didn't buy Tesla on the dip
Trust me I bet there‚Äôs a lot of people today hurting from tesla but I think it will swing back up.
Futures blood green Tesla $5000 EOD tmrw
I lost so much fucking money on Tesla today holy shit
And the idea that fucking Tesla would buy them just to use the store locations as charging sports is mind blowingly stupid
what about VW? You know Tesla is the 3rd most selling EV in Norway? a country where 50% of cars sold are already EV
Tesla $1000 EOW or I‚Äôm ruined
In what universe do you see Tesla as operating with no competitors?
Tesla AH Recovery???
LUCID -NEXT TESLA
Buy CCIV as quick as you can! Lucid literally the best spac target so far. This is actually the next Tesla.
Walmart announces  new platform where employees can ‚Äòinvest‚Äô up to 50% of their paycheck into Weekly Tesla Calls as a means to crawl out of crushing poverty, and for an additional 5 dollars a month, walmart gold will allow them to Yolo their next 3 month salary on a up to 15 deep out of the money tesla calls up to 3 days out!‚Äù -CNBC News
It‚Äôs all fun and games until NIO gets gobbled up by the CCP and then boom no more competition, Tesla at least you can trust the mind behind it all
Wow you really drank the Elon Musk Koolaid today!  The difference between Tesla and Walmart is that Tesla only looks big on paper.  Walmart is actually big IN THE REAL WORLD
#Lucid Motors (CCIV) is a Tesla killer!#üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I bought the dip on Tesla three different times today. If we don‚Äôt get a Green day tomorrow yah boy is in major trouble
&gtbut not until Feb.Oh fucking please, as if anyone could rationalize how much and how quickly Tesla can move.  It left the realm of fundamentals ages ago
Tesla with saudi money üòÇ
Some Tesla fanboys convinced me not to buy TSLA puts on Friday :'(
Today was a bad day for the 17 year olds on this sub. Both rule number 4 and Tesla got a spanking.
Anyone else buying Tesla tomorrow?
So tesla calls tomorrow?ü•∫
Made 5k on selling Tesla calls at open.  Thank you, retards
Tesla dropped almost 10% today and slightly OTM weekly puts were only up about 100% rofl. That's why I don't touch it, premiums are insane
Just buy a fucking Tesla
Defs a 36y.o. male, living alone in a shoe box at some 50k/yr jobFeeling the fomo hard and got a 25% gain last week on tesla so feels great. Today feels bad so makes up some story to shit on boomers.
Will Tesla bounce back? Will my calls ever print? Find out next time on Wall...Street...BETSss!!
You aren't an autist you just had dumb luck since Tesla = shooting fish in a tendies barrel.  Don't be lie that idiot a couple months ago that convinced his Mom to let him manage her 401K and he pissed it all away down to zero playing WSB memes.  Let Dad pick his dividend portfolio like a good Boomer.
tesla 900 EOW. lets be real.
I mean. To be frank you ARE retarded for going all in on Tesla. But luckily it's working.Better to be a rich retard than a broke genius. Though, let's be real, not betting on Tesla is also pretty retarded.If you bet and fail you're retarded. If you bet and win you're a lucky retard.
Better lock that profit in soon. Betting against Tesla is a good way to go broke.
Yo i made 60$ on tesla puts i might retire
Considering tesla was $880 on fri. Chill.
I'm kind of looking forward to when Tesla dips because of how smug some people have gotten.
I heard the next stimulus is a Tesla for every american
TSLA 7% down day isn't really much tbhI mean we've seen tesla drop 20% in a day and recover it quite quickly before. It's frankly just a volatile AF stock
This sub is the most flip floppy place I swear. 3 days ago you could be downvoted to the earth‚Äôs core for questioning Tesla lol
For anyone that thinks this is just another ev start up chasing tesla, [watch this video](https://youtu.be/i9BY0DYbmoU)Different car aimed at a different market and really great advancements in EV motors. The thing is an absolute missile.
If you fomo bought tesla at the top and are shitting your pants, thats what you deserve.
Its ugly as fuck, but it appeals to the retarded 2nd grader in you. Honestly, its a brilliant way to get into the truck segment. You know truck people were having no part of an electric truck, so Musk made an ugly truck that non-truck people could become emotionally attached to. He's gonna sell the truck to non-truck people, the truck is gonna outperform ICE trucks, and eventually truck people will come around. I would guess this is the point where the Tesla Model 69 (a proper truck) hits the market. Same specs, but doesn't look like garbage a 6 year old drew.
**Remember how Tesla can rally 25% in a week?**&amp#x200BLOL imagine not buying this dip even though BUYDEN offering full EV tax credit Thursday
This is probably the dumbest post of all the tesla posts today. You'd have tesla be a 1.2T market cap co by end of next week? Jesus h Christ I'm shocked this even has any value.
**LISTEN UP RETARDS AND AUTISTS:**Dump PSTH for CCIV. No chance Bill Spacman gets a better company than Lucid Motors **aka Baby Tesla**.This is your chance to go all in and get rich. This is what you've been waiting for.Seize the moment. Disclosure: I'm all in shares.
So are we all buying Tesla calls or not
Someone cut my finger off before I buy these Tesla weeklys
BREAKING NEWS TESLA LOSES TOP JANITORIAL AIDE TO CO-FOUNDER JB WENTWORTH'S RESTAURANT CHAIN WENDYS
Saying 1/8 of Tesla if that was a way to measure things lmao. They‚Äôre both equally overvalued
I am expecting a stimulus bill late next week whereby the government will purchase a Tesla to launch into space for scientific purposes and the cost of the Tesla will be $1 trillion. COGS will be like $80k. Literally can't go tits up.
Man I really shouldve bought something other than just a bunch of tesla stock
Mate if this goes to merger, it'll hit $50. This is a true Tesla competitor.
So Tesla gonna open at 850 tomorrow or nah
I shorted Tesla on Friday. Feels good to win one
Bought Tesla 1000c on Friday, but guess who isn‚Äôt a bitch and selling. I‚Äôll ride it down to -99.99% fuck it
Tesla entering prices not seen since Jan 7, 2021.
I told my friend about Tesla this morning and he immediately bought Tesla calls. He‚Äôs calling me right now but I‚Äôm afraid to answer lmao
Who bought Tesla calls this morning
Sounds like most Tesla investors right now
I know rite??? These fake ass gurus out here acting like they William Buffet and shit.They can learn a thing or two from me, I'm a bit of an expert. Bought Tesla at $500 when the whole world was like "nah, I aint buying Tesla". I was frfr the only one buying. It's lonely at the top. Cashapp me two easy payments of $9.99 and I'll share my secrets wit u
If you have been waiting for a tesla dip, its your time to grow a pair.  Buy dip phaggot
HEY STOP FKIN SELLING TESLA
Imagine holding Tesla and then saying long term is for pussiesAhh the ultimate retard
Dude, I've never seen this. I hope you originate this.I'm definitely using this now. Amazing dude, hope you win so I can buy cheap Tesla. This run been too ridiculous. We need another refuel. Every crash of Tesla is just another easier run up to cash in on.
LUCID IS THE CLOSEST THING TO TESLA, YOU'RE BUYING TESLA AT IPO
That's what I said about Tesla....Never bet against Musk.
thats not exactly impressive. he decided to bet against probably the worst possible stock to bet against right now and got lucky. we can all agree tesla is likely a bubble without being dumb enough to try to predict exactly when it will pop
We should all be happy with a Tesla style 12 month squeeze.
Have you seen Tesla?
Stock Analyst:Tesla is overvalued because 95% of Wall Street got it wrong.
Yep lots of ex Tesla employees there too.
Yes and Lucid was also a big competitor with Tesla in the early days. Lots of ex Tesla employees at Lucid.
Tesla has a red day after a nonstop massive run up Tard tesla bears "SEE WE KNEW IT, TSLA DED !!1!"
Before you buy the dip on Tesla, the stock went down from $500 to $370 back in September even with hype for Battery Day few days away
Jesus fucking Christ choosing ferrari over teslaWhat a degenerate lmao
Good you're a criminal charging people for luke warm shitty advice. I remember when my "licensed broker" told me to sell my tesla shares in college. He charged me 50 bucks too. Fucking twat. You're basically a snake oil salesman.
Tesla: The Big Sad
Starting to finally try and make some safe plays, got in on a Tesla 1/15 $1,160 call
 Tesla at levels not seen since...checks notes...Friday. üßê
Tesla green EOD, Moon EOW
ngl, already a problem lol. It usually becomes a problem when the herd mentality of shorters changes to that of they can't manipulate the market anymore or their thesis changes. TESLA is one example of slow run of shorts covering. KBIO short squeeze is because shorts had to cover because they couldn't burrow shares anymore due to Shkreli not lending his shares. VW is because porsche accumulated but suddenly revealed that they had cash-settled options that they accumulated under the radar. Each case the shorters realised that they weren't going to win. I'd assume above 24 right now because that's where Melvin's puts are at 51k, that's 51 million shares shorted.
Y‚Äôall were asking for a dip to buy Tesla, here it is so hop in pussies
# Tesla moon initiated, still time to buy the FOOKIN dip!!
I made 113k since Christmas from Tesla options, how do I break the news to my parents. (I‚Äôm 20)
Alright Tesla. We‚Äôre entering your favorite 2 hours. You don‚Äôt have to end green. Just get close for us.
Tesla crashing to levels it hasn't seen since... earlier this morning. Y'all crack me up.
This is a CFD. I've informed OP already in German below, but for the rest of you retards read this:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/in463n/new\_draconian\_tax\_law\_in\_germany\_for\_derivatives/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/in463n/new_draconian_tax_law_in_germany_for_derivatives/)This new law against derivatives will fuck anybody who touches CFDs in Germany, especially on something as volatile as Tesla.
Someone poke Tesla with a stick
Look at the 1 year chart of Tesla, and tell me why a car manufacturer with only 4 models and a fraction of the volume of legacy brands has gone up so much in market cap. It‚Äôs because of autism the likes we have never seen before. Holding these $300 and $400 puts like the golden tickets they are üò§
I just bought a Tesla 1100 call. After seeing that one retard with that FD that went from 300 to 17k I thought might as well
I‚Äôm with you. I got all tied up in Tesla but now have a mysterious $600 to throw somewhere. Someone make me richer than Elongated musk oxen.
Im gonna cum buckets when Tesla goes green today
If Tesla would somehow turn positive I will stop wearing women‚Äôs lingerie
Just grabbed a tesla March 100p for 10 bucks. Elon your days are numbered
Omg is Tesla getting a boner ?!?üôàüôà
Bruh did Tesla ban Trump or something ?
I'm a simple man, I see Tesla drop \~4%, I buy more.
Why did Cramer have to say Tesla can go higher though...
I‚Äôm going down with Tesla if that‚Äôs what it takes. Fuck it. Money isn‚Äôt real anyway.
This was certainly true in recent years, but Tesla is now in bubble territory by any sane metric. I don't know if the correction will happen in two months, or two years, but I'm positive that Tesla will be trading below $400 five years from now.
My Tesla 1/15 1000cs will print soon I‚Äôm certain
there is huge open call interest for 15-Jan because not only is it the third Friday of the month but there's a bunch of LEAPS people bought the last few years that are expiring.  i think there may be a lot of sell pressure on calls this week as people avoid taking assignment, especially for retail traders who bought short-dated OTM calls the last few weeks who may not even have the capital to take assignment of $70,000 worth of Tesla for one $700 ITM call.  call selling may drive the stock down since there would be less shares that need to be bought or held in order for the original options writers to make delivery.that was my thesis anyway.  i bought a few puts last Friday, just a small speculative position.
Tesla has a V pullback like every other week and then immediately pumps the next day. Look at december before Christmas. Dropped 5% entered the SP500 and gained another 30% since.
Today you learned. The section of Gigafactory that produces cell is owned and operated by Panasonic. Remainder of factory is owned by Tesla to efficiently package them as it suits their needs.
You realize Tesla shorts lost $40 billion last year? At least set a stop loss
If the NIO news was labeled Tesla, we‚Äôd have a 25% day...
Life is too short to short Tesla
Elon secret weapon = Tesla buy SpaceX
Tesla wont drop below 800 How confident am I about this ? 0 percent
TESLA GREEN BY EOD IM CALLING IT
Also interesting: ArcelorMittal just announced a couple of hours ago, that they're having talks with Tesla about steel deliveries for the new plant in Berlin.   Steel + Tesla? You must be a total retard not to buy now.
Lol Tesla Bulls are the gayest fucking retards on the planet. They get so mad at anyone threatening their bubble with any sort of realism.
Neither is Tesla. They design the battery to suit their needs and have Panasonic, LG or CATL produce it for them.
I love being the idiot who loses money on Tesla
I decided to finally get into Tesla and it‚Äôs falling
Dude DJIA is a price weighted index, not market cap. So a $1000 stock would control an overwhelming majority of DJIA (based on the price of other companies in there). Tesla is never getting added. Same reason Amazon/Google/etc will never get added despite being pillars of USA economy. DJIA is becoming irrelevant anyways.
Tesla 1000c eow gang in shambles
I just bought a Tesla 1200 call
You do realise that your potential downside/loss is unlimited whereas your max gain is fairly limited? I would not sleep very well on that thought regardless of the specific stock, let alone fucking TESLA. Why would you expose yourself to infinite losses like this?
I'm no Tesla fan at this level....but aren't GM, Ford and others burdened with huge pension and healthcare liabilities because of the unions?
Tesla...something, something...invade Poland.
Tesla = Tesla. No need to thank me, just spreading my knowledge
If Tesla finishes green I will buy a pterodactyl
Tesla giving me that tingly feeling in my dick you get on an elevator. Would not be surprised for it to go down or up 10% from here
Tesla eow predictions ( bulls only )
But they won't be selling during the squeeze, it will drop back down pretty quickly. That might look bad for them, signal that's it's not great long term. A long drawn out squeeze like tesla would be better.
Tesla melt up all day with power hour to send it back to 875
Imagine not buying literally any available tesla option. Guess you like being poor
Some retard bought a tesla put at the bottom and is now downvoting everyone.

Took a 20k loss on Tesla üò≠
Yeah.  The value is a complete bubble.  When Elon was saying it was overvalued, it was.  I don't think people realize that in order for Tesla to capitalize on this they have to issue more stock.  Or maybe Elon will spend some of his OWN stock.  I had FOMO last March and bought back in with 3 shares in a retirement account.   I own a Model 3, it's a wonderful car, but the 1 million dollars per car sold market cap is stupid.  This isn't Amazon.  Amazon has a HUGE infrastructure underpinning it and was driven up by AWS.  RIP future morons I guess.
Tesla needs to announce that 25k car so this shit pumps to 1000
Buy Tesla dip now or wait for another day?
With Tesla down and Gamestop up I predict WSB will be a flood of useless information today. Let me paraphrase all of today's posts "gay brs r fk, by te dp" "shrt sqze is her, dnt mss!"
I look on this sub expecting the worst for tesla then I look at AH it‚Äôs only down 1.6% ü§°

Opposite happened to me i put my savings in tesla and managed to persuade my mum to put her savings in tesla too lmao
Yeah... bailed on Tesla once it hit that magic number of $420.  Was super happy I doubled up.       Oh well...   at least I got NIO at $3 and sitting on that.
FUCK YOU TESLA JUST FUCKING MOOOOON
Tesla. Calls.
Damn so NIO really is the Chinese Tesla
When the fuck wil palantir be at 900 like fucking tesla
i saw tesla at 400$ two months ago and said it was over valuated and not to buy... we all struggling in some way
Tesla risky? Noooo. Those talks about tesla almost going bankrupt are just lies. Oh wait, Elon said that? well..
People have been saying this for years now, and it‚Äôs only gone up. Everyone at this point is aware that the day will come but no one knows when. Tesla isn‚Äôt even a company anymore it‚Äôs a fucking anomaly.Just take the risk like the rest of us retards instead of stating the obvious and try not to be one of those ‚Äúpeople‚Äù
People want Tesla but can't afford it so they google EV stocks and NIO pops up, buy fucking NIO it's the next Tesla
Man lost so much comment karma for answering  to the ‚ÄûTesla was never at 33 cent‚Äú people on this post.
God I hate myself for not jumping on Tesla when I had the funds.
Tesla coming back üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Say it with me:Tesla is not a bubble and it won‚Äôt trigger the ev bubble pop
Don't worry guys, $2000 stimmy will go straight to bitcoin and Tesla. Prices will hit the new ATH.
Well I can‚Äôt take this anymore. I‚Äôm going to sleep. Goodnight &amp may Tesla open at $870 at least :,)
I bought Tesla on Friday and I'm never going to make the mistake of selling that shit again. So come on bring it on!!!
Finally after waiting one month to be able to post to this forum because I‚Äôm new here, I am proud to say if Tesla goes down anymore after hours , I will personally shove an RPG up my ass and let freedom rain
Similar to how you are struggling to google ‚ÄúTesla stock price in 2010‚Äù? Pretty bad for someone who was in AP Chem. Just saying.
The west is in a death spiral.... Better to be a balling wastelander shooting bandits from a Tesla, than a broke wastelander getting shot at by some autist in a Tesla.
People are worried because of the rate it's going lol it's climbing crazy fast and valued at nearly 1 trillion dollars which seems crazy considering they don't generate a lot of money. Lots of people are expecting this bubble to burst and the stock price to plummet. I'm still riding it tho so fuck it tesla to the moonüöÄüöÄ
Tesla shares were never worth 33 cents no matter how you account for splits.
Tesla was never valued at $.33. Even accounting for the split. This is a post of lies.
If Tesla moons much further I swear ima consider retirement
im gonna get a fractional share of tesla so i don‚Äôt feel left out
Lol said it yesterday:Tesla will open on a dip and NIO will open on a rip. People will panic sell Tesla and panic buy NIO. Then they‚Äôre going to violently switch lol. üòÇü§ò
